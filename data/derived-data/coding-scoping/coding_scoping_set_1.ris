AB  - Computation of energy from a tidal power station is very complex due to continuous change in the tide level and consequently in the head and discharge of the turbine. There are large numbers of variables which affect the tidal energy generation. The choice of type and size of generating unit, number of generators, total sluice area and selection of main parameters of turbine and generator form part of energy optimization studies. A computer program based on dynamic programming techniques has been developed and utilized to determine the optimum MW installation, energy availability and total sluice area required for Kachchh Tidal Power Plant.

AB  - In recent years, marine renewable energy has received more and more attention due to concerns regarding energy shortages, global warming and environmental pollution. Marine renewable energy includes tidal energy, current energy, wave energy, osmotic energy and ocean thermal energy. A recent study predicts a global growth in renewable energy as a response to increasing world energy demands. The OTEC (ocean thermal energy conversion) power plant is one candidate. OTEC transforms the heat stored in the surface water of tropical oceans, into mechanical work to produce energy. The purpose of this study is to create numerical equations about the amount of pump energy required in OTEC power generation systems. The results show that the energy and power of the pump is greatly influenced by OTEC power, pipe type, cold water discharge, and cold water depth. Â© 2019 Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

AB  - In this paper, the design, construction and ocean testing of a wave energy conversion system are studied. Based on the motion characteristics of double buoys in ocean waves, a wave energy conversion system with permanent magnet tubular linear generator (PMTLG) is proposed to convert ocean wave energy into electricity. The wave energy conversion system was installed in the Yellow Sea near Lianyungang, China. The ocean test results indicate that it had dynamic and static performance, and obtained an expected amount of electricity. The calculation result indicates the average output power was about 1,000,W, and the conversion efficiency from wave energy into electricity was 1.4%,. In addition, the wireless data communication, mechanics and oceanography were also discussed. Â© 2016, Tianjin University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The paper examines the value of variable power sources, such as wind and tidal energy, on electricity supply systems. A statistical approach is developed for assessing the operational impacts, including thermal plant cycling and operating reserve requirements. It is shown from this analysis that operating penalties are negligible when the capacities involved are small relative to the overall system, as long as reserve is optimally scheduled. Simplified equations are also presented for estimating operating penalties from limited data. The paper then discusses the impact of variable sources at higher system penetrations, and uses modelling studies to examine the possible economic value of wind energy up to very high capacities. The possible technical characteristics of future power systems are discussed in this light. Finally, the paper examines the contribution of variable sources to system reliability and the nature of capital savings arising from this. The capacity contribution in many circumstances is equivalent to conventional sources, but in general the importance of capacity issues is much less than generally believed. The overall conclusion is that for a given energy output, variable sources are often as valuable as equivalent conventional sources when the capacity is small, and their contribution can be very large before the penalties of variability become significant.

AB  - Recently, international regulations have started to come into force due to increasing of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as a greenhouse gas emission from ships. There are two important emission regulations which are European Union Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (EU-MRV) and International Maritime Organization Data Collection System (IMO DCS) as a Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) Part 2, became valid from 2018 to 2019, respectively. Both EU MRV and IMO DCS regulations are mandatory for the ships above 5000 GRT and examine CO2 emissions related to international shipping. Within this framework, the aim of this article involves to guide the shipping companies about energy efficiency and environmental management with comparing energy efficiency measures as novel Fleet Energy Efficiency Management Index (FEEMI), CO2 emissions, CO2 index and Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) values. In this study, firstly, operational energy efficiency values have been analyzed with a voyage details of five bulk carrier ships to assess the possible reasons of the changings by the years of 2017 and 2018. Furthermore, FEEMI have been defined as a novel energy efficiency indicator to evaluate the performance of the shipping companies. Lastly, different scenarios have been carried out to observe the effects of cargo carried capacity and fuel consumption amount on EEOI. As numerical results, the highest CO2 emissions and index values are found for ship C1 as 29,676 tonnes and 54,592 tonnes with 433 x 10(-3) tonnes CO2/nmile and 449 x 10(-3) tonnes CO2/nmile for the years of 2017 and 2018, respectively. Besides, the lowest energy efficiency operational indicator (EEOI) are calculated for ship C1 as 4.43 x 10(-6) tonnes CO2/MT.nmile and 5.06 x 10(-6) tonnes CO2/MT.nmile for the years of 2017 and 2018, respectively.

AB  - The development of the Illinois Basin-Decatur USA test site for a 1 million tonne injection of CO2 into the Mount Simon Sandstone saline reservoir beginning in 2011 has been a multiphase process requiring a wide array of personnel and resources that began in 2003. The process of regional characterization took two years as part of a Phase I effort focused on the entire Illinois Basin, located in Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky, USA. Seeking the cooperation of an industrial source of CO2 and site selection within the Basin took place during Phase II while most of the concurrent research emphasis was on a set of small-scale tests of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) and CO2 injection into a coal seam. Phase III began the commitment to the 1 million-tonne test site development through the collaboration of the Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) who is providing a site, the CO2, and developing a compression facility, of Schlumberger Carbon Services who is providing expertise for operations, drilling, geophysics, risk assessment, and reservoir modelling, and of the Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS) whose geologists and engineers lead the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium (MGSC). Communications and outreach has been a collaborative effort of ADM, ISGS and Schlumberger Carbon Services. The Consortium is one of the seven Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships, a carbon sequestration research program supported by the National Energy Technology Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy.

AB  - Environmentally friendly green technological innovations driven by the evolving regulatory landscape have the potential to provide performance solutions for the next generation of ships and offshore vessels. The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, Annex VI (MARPOL) requirements has become one of the most influential pieces of maritime legislation passed setting in motion a series of requirements that change the way vessels are designed and operated. The shipping and offshore industries are being revolutionized by the confluence of Annex VI requirements which limit the amount of sulfur in fuel oil, limit the amount of nitrogen oxides emitted from the engine combustion process, and reduce CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. The economics of alternative fuels such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and low sulfur fuels and the imperatives of operating in Emission Control Areas (ECAs) are driving highly innovative vessel, system, and equipment designs. For vessels with operating profiles best serviced by hybrid type plants, operators can greatly benefit by adopting environmentally friendly green technologies such as renewable energy, alternative fuels, hybrid propulsion and power generation plants, and advanced environmental treatment systems. This paper will outline a number of these advanced green ship technologies currently being adopted in ship and offshore vessel design and considers the opportunities this presents for future vessel designs.

AB  - This paper addresses the importance of the implementation and enforcement of the energy efficiency measures for ships. These measures are frequently referred to and used as a tool for carbon mitigation by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from ships in order to protect the Earth's climate. Moreover, these measures can also play an important role in climate adaptation. The purpose of this paper is to look briefly at the current and expected impact of the ships' energy efficiency measures developed under auspices of the International Maritime Organization, i.e.: the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) on climate change mitigation. Both of them, EEDI and SEEMP became mandatory measures after the adoption of amendments to the Annex VI of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), and their entry into force in 2013. Furthermore, those measures were also the first legally binding tools relating to climate change, adopted since the Kyoto Protocol.

AB  - Climate change, increasing fuel oil prices and new international regulation on ship emissions lead to more focus on shipping fuel consumption and energy efficiency. There are various solutions for improving the ship energy efficiency. In this manuscript, we aim to present a real case of energy saving by adopting the central cooling system with box cooler on the ship instead of conventional system. The electric energy power necessary for operating the machinery cooling system of the ship is calculated for conventional cooling system and compared to the cooling system using box coolers in term of fuel oil consumption and CO2 emissions. This study quantified the fuel saving potential that could be achieved with use of keel coolers. Adopting central cooling with box coolers may contribute in reduction of fuel oil consumption and improving the ship energy efficiency. systems. should not contain citations.

AB  - Arctic Ocean environments are quite delicate, and shipping in Arctic regions has been very limited. Although ships are the most efficient means of cargo transport from an air quality perspective, they are never the less considered large point sources of CO2 and GHG emissions. Recognizing this, local far north Alaskan air quality requirements have called for the use of Ultra Low Sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuels to lessen SOx emissions from engine driven main propulsion systems and other onboard auxiliary machinery. ULSD (limited to 15 ppm or 0.0015% sulfur) exceeds all current requirements for marine diesel fuels to be burned in the proposed Emissions Control Areas worldwide. There is a price to pay for burning ULSD, as the physical properties of the diesel fuel are changed during the sulfur removal process. In addition, end-product fuel analysis varies depending upon the sulfur content in the feed stock, and the oil refinery used to produce ULSD. Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel is known to have caused engine and component malfunctions due to decreased lubricity, viscosity, and other compositional incompatibilities. This paper (referencing a recently completed project) will highlight the methodology used to prepare a ship for the switch from Marine Gas Oil to ULSD. Copyright 2011, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Summary of the report submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO): Marginal abatement costs and cost effectiveness of energy-efficiency measures
JO  - Transactions - Society Of Naval Architects And Marine Engineers
PY  - 2010
VL  - 118
IS  - NA
AB  - This report (see IMO MEPC 62/5/INF.7) had two primaty purposes. The first was to develop a standardized methodology for examining energy-efficiency improvement measures on ships, and it was designed to estimate the cost-effectiveness and CO2 emissions reduction potential of each measure. The second objective of this report was to apply the methodology to the twenty-two (22) abatement measures, including speed reductions, for which data was available. The data on the cost, reliability, variability, and effectiveness of each abatement measure was obtained from published sources including both manufacturers and other studies. We attempted to corroborate this data with direct interviews of operators and others with experience with the measures. Further work needs to be done on the actual in-service cost, reliability, variability, and effectiveness of these measures. SNAME's T&amp;R Committee panel EC-11 will continue to evaluate these measures. This analysis provided estimates of CO2 emissions reduction potential and associated marginal abatement costs for 14 types of new and existing ships as defined by the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Green House Gas (GHG) Experts Group. For each vessel type, size, and age, these cost estimates were plotted against estimated CO2 emissions reduction potential, and the marginal abatement cost curves for each ship type were developed. Sensitivity analyses were also performed to examine the impact of fuel prices and discount rates on the cost effectiveness of the measures. To avoid complexity, all costs are in US dollars, and emission reductions are in metric tonnes CO2. This study did not assume that ship owners and operators would make the investments or employ the specific operational measures, but just demonstrated what the estimated costs and benefits would be if the measures were implemented. The report strives to present these estimates in an accessible format. Key findings should be of interest to policy makers, ship owners and operators, as well as other interested parties. In regards to speed reduction, two levels have been analyzed: a 10% speed reduction and a 20% speed reduction. Although both levels have negative abatement costs (i.e., are profitable at projected fuel prices), the cost-effectiveness of a 10% speed reduction is superior to a 20% speed reduction. Therefore, for most ship types, a 10% speed reduction was included in the marginal abatement cost curves, which resulted in a smaller abatement potential than previously published. It should be noted, however, that this study did not evaluate the optimal speed reduction. Most likely, the speed reductions with the optimal cost-effectiveness lie between 10% and 20% for most ship types, so that the abatement potentials of speed reductions presented in this paper are underestimated. This paper is an abridged version of a report by the same authors submitted to IMO's sixty-second meeting of the Marine Environmental Protection (MEPC 62). For more details on the methodology and findings in this report, the reader is directed to that report, available at www.sname.org. Methodology: This report examined fifty (SO) technical and operational energy-efficiency improvement measures and presents an analysis of twenty-two (22) of these measures for which we could obtain useable data. The analysis includes an assessment of the cost effectiveness and abatement potential of each measure (often presented as a range). The applicability of each measure was determined for new and existing vessels and fourteen (14) ship types by size and age (a total of three hundred eighteen (318) combinations). Implementation barriers and strategies to address these barriers are described in this paper. A basis for projecting and applying the learning rate for new technologies was developed and used in estimates of future costs. The measures were arranged in fifteen (15) groups to ensure that similar measures were identified as mutually exclusive so as not to overestimate the energy-efficiency improvement potentials of employing multiple measures. For each measure and for each vessel type by size and by age, where the measure is appropriate, low and high estimates of the cost-effectiveness to employ the measure were estimated. The range of estimates reflects different operating patterns of vessels and uncertainty about the cost and abatement potential of individual measures. These estimates of cost effectiveness are for a high emissions' reduction potential and a low emissions' reduction potential. For each reduction potential, there is one high cost estimate and one low cost estimate. The low and high reduction potentials are associated with the ranges and uncertainty of both the cost effectiveness and the energy-efficiency improvement potential for each measure. In turn, marginal abatement costs curves (MACC), resulting from the analysis, are presented in the full report for new construction for the fourteen ship types. The MACC plots marginal abatement costs against CO2 emissions reductions. These MACC were based on a rank ordering of the measures or group of measures based on the cost effectiveness and the appropriateness of the measure to a specific ship type and size, including impact on percent (%) emissions' reduction, ease of implementation, and other factors. The cost-effectiveness of individual measures was summed to develop marginal abatement cost curves. These MACC are graphically presented in this report with high, central, and low estimates for the fourteen ship types. The complete data and findings for each measure, including estimated cost effectiveness and potential C02 emissions reduction that comprise these MACC, are available at http:/Avww.sname.org/SNAME/ climatechange/ MACreport and http://www.theicct.org/programs/Marine. The specific measures which make up each MACC estimate are identified. The cost effectiveness and the estimates of CO2 emissions reduction potential for each measure vary widely as a function of ship type, size, and age. We depict this by providing low and high estimates. A range is given because of the uncertainty with respect to the costs and abatement potential. The aggregation of these costs when estimating the net abatement potential using marginal abatement curves similarly shows that the costs and abatement potential vary widely among types of ships. In particular, when aggregating cost effectiveness estimates for measures to develop MACC curves, analysts should be attentive to the impact that certain measures have (i.e., ship types) that impact the net costs and potential of efficiency improvements.

AB  - Seagrass meadows are considered crucial natural carbon stocks. However, in Tanzania, few species have been assessed for their potential carbon stocks and variability in percentage organic carbon (%Corg) stocks. The study reports the contributions of seagrasses Halodule uninervis and Syringodium isoetifolium in carbon storage in WIO region. Findings revealed a significantly higher %Corg in seagrass meadows compared to unvegetated, confirming that seagrass heightens organic carbon storage. The seagrass carbon storage varied significantly among sites ranging from 4.05 Â± 0.7% in Kaole to 0.62 Â± 0.05% in Kunduchi. Syringodium isoetifolium meadows had higher organic carbon (p = 0.002) than H. uninervis. The partial least square analysis showed that below- and aboveground biomass and canopy height were positively correlated to %Corg. Sediment density and porosity were the vital predictor but negatively correlated with %Corg. The study showed a higher %Corg in the marine protected area, which could be linked to seagrass structural complexities and sediment porosity. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - China is one of the countries that has abundant wind power resources. It has been estimated that in our country, the available onshore wind power resource is 253 million kW, while the offshore resource on the sea is even bigger, about 750 million kW. Since China has reformed and opened up to improve its energy structure, the development and application of wind power has been thriving. Coastal provinces, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and other places are all planning and building large-scale wind power farms, and more than 80 have been completed. The high degree of instability of wind power, however, results in the sharp and random fluctuations of wind power current, which seriously restricts the proportion of wind power in the power grid. The less-than-10% proportion of wind power, which, so far, countries have not been able to exceed, has become a worldwide problem. Our specific national conditions determine that China's wind power market must take the road of diversified development while, at the same time, pursuing and exploring the development and practice of non-grid-connected wind power systems under our national conditions. In 1986, the concept of non-grid-connected wind power was first introduced by Professor Gu Weidong. Through 20 years of development and practice, we have made some initial success and formed a certain degree of independent intellectual property rights. This paper concentrates on the strategic goals, the strategic emphases, and the strategic significations of the non-grid-connected wind power development in order to provide valuable consulting services for the diversified development of China's wind power industry.

AB  - The estimation of energy production of a given WEC (wave energy converter) at a given coastal site is the basis for correct decision-making regarding wave energy exploitation in a coastal region. Nevertheless, the procedure followed by the conventional approach to characterize the wave energy resource does not provide the required information to obtain an accurate estimate. In this work, this information is provided for the region with the greatest resource in the Iberian Peninsula, the Death Coast (NW Spain). For this purpose, a geospatial database is produced by using a methodology which involves the consideration of virtually the totality of the resource together with the implementation of a high resolution spectral numerical model. In addition, a Matlab-based toolbox called WEDGE (Wave Energy Diagram GEnerator) is implemented to access the database and automatically generate high resolution energy diagrams (or characterization matrices) of the wave energy resource at any coastal location within this region. In this way, a precise computation of energy production of any WEC at any site of interest can now be performed. Finally, the functionality of the database is shown through a case study of a recently proposed wave farm. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Local oceanic CO2 outgassing triggered by terrestrial carbon fluxes during deglacial flooding
JO  - Climate Of The Past
PY  - 2022
VL  - 18
IS  - 2
AB  - Exchange of carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere is a key process that influences past climates via glacial-interglacial variations of the CO2 concentration. The melting of ice sheets during deglaciations induces a sea level rise which leads to the flooding of coastal land areas, resulting in the transfer of terrestrial organic matter to the ocean. However, the consequences of such fluxes on the ocean biogeochemical cycle and on the uptake and release of CO2 are poorly constrained. Moreover, this potentially important exchange of carbon at the land-sea interface is not represented in most Earth system models. We present here the implementation of terrestrial organic matter fluxes into the ocean at the transiently changing land-sea interface in the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model (MPI-ESM) and investigate their effect on the biogeochemistry during the last deglaciation. Our results show that during the deglaciation, most of the terrestrial organic matter inputs to the ocean occurs during Meltwater Pulse 1a (between 15-14Äâ‚¬Â¯ka) which leads to the transfer of 21.2Äâ‚¬Â¯GtC of terrestrial carbon (mostly originating from wood and humus) to the ocean. Although this additional organic matter input is relatively small in comparison to the global ocean inventory (0.06Äâ‚¬Â¯%) and thus does not have an impact on the global CO2 flux, the terrestrial organic matter fluxes initiate oceanic outgassing in regional hotspots like in Indonesia for a few hundred years. Finally, sensitivity experiments highlight that terrestrial organic matter fluxes are the drivers of oceanic outgassing in flooded coastal regions during Meltwater Pulse 1a. Furthermore, the magnitude of outgassing is rather insensitive to higher carbon-to-nutrient ratios of the terrestrial organic matter. Our results provide a first estimate of the importance of terrestrial organic matter fluxes in a transient deglaciation simulation. Moreover, our model development is an important step towards a fully coupled carbon cycle in an Earth system model applicable to simulations at glacial-interglacial cycles. Â© 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Seagrass ecosystems are globally-significant `blue carbon' sinks; however, there is concern that this capacity will decline if rising ocean temperatures accelerate microbial decomposition. Decomposition of plant litter is a key process in the global carbon cycle-it influences how much carbon is available for sequestration. Therefore, understanding the biogeochemistry underlying decomposition is essential to predicting the capacity of seagrass ecosystems to act as carbon sinks in the future. Here, we tracked the breakdown of standardised and natural litter of varying chemical recalcitrance (rooibos tea > seagrass leaves > green tea) combined with highly-sensitive microsensor technology to test (a) how elevated water temperatures affect short-term microbial turnover, and (b) provide novel information on how the decay dynamics of the tea litter compare to those of natural litter. We found that increased temperatures (+ 5-10 degrees C) boosted microbial activity for all substrates, exhibited as enhanced decay, oxygen consumption and sulphate reduction. Within the 1-month experiment, the green tea litter had a rapid Q10 response to the temperature increase, quickly exhausting the resources for microbes, while the response of the rooibos tea and seagrass litters became more apparent toward the end of the experiment. Our results suggest that the tea litters capture a range of decomposition traits and can be compared with natural litter using traditional exponential decay models. The enhanced temperature-driven organic matter turnover, even under anoxic conditions, highlights the vulnerability of fresh litter to microbial attack during the early stages of decay and the potential weakening of blue carbon accumulation rates under future climatic conditions.

TI  - Large two-stroke marine diesel engine operation with a high-pressure SCR system in heavy weather conditions
JO  - Journal Of Ship Research
PY  - 2021
VL  - 65
IS  - 3
AB  - The transient performance of a direct-drive large two-stroke marine diesel engine, installed in a vessel operating in a seaway with heavy weather, is investigated via simulation. The main engine of the ship is equipped with a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) aftertreatment system for compliance with the latest International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules for NOx reduction, IMO Tier III. Because of limitations of exhaust gas temperature at the inlet of SCR systems and the low temperature exhaust gases produced by marine diesel engines, in marine applications, the SCR system is installed on the high-pressure side of the turbine. When a ship sails in heavy weather, it experiences a resistance increase, wave-induced motions, and a time-varying flow field in the propeller, induced by ship motions. This results in a fluctuation of the propeller torque demand and, thus, a fluctuation in engine power and exhaust gas temperature, which can affect engine and SCR performance. To investigate this phenomenon and take into account the engineâ€“propeller interaction, the entire propulsion plant was modeled, namely, the slow-speed diesel propulsion engine, the high-pressure SCR system, the directly driven propeller, and the shipâ€™s hull. To simulate the transient propeller torque demand, a propeller model was used, and torque variations due to ship motions were taken into account. Ship motions in waves and wave-added resistance were calculated for regular and irregular waves using a 3D panel code. The coupled model was validated against available measured data from a shipboard propulsion system in good weather conditions. The model was then used to simulate the behavior of a Tier III marine propulsion plant during acceleration from low to medium load, in the presence of regular and irregular waves. The effect of the time-varying propeller demand on the engine and the SCR system was investigated. Â© 2021 Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers. All rights reserved.

TI  - An Intelligent Control Scheme for Optimum Efficiency and Reduced Emission Operation of Marine Transportation System
JO  - Ieee Transactions On Intelligent Transportation Systems
PY  - 2022
VL  - 23
IS  - 10
AB  - This paper proposes an intelligent control scheme (ICS) for optimum efficiency and reduced emission operation in small marine transportation systems such as tugs, research vessels, and small scale cruiser ships. The diesel engines used in marine and other transport related applications are designed to provide optimum efficiency at a specific value of mechanical loading. Generally, these engines provide the best fuel efficiency near 80\% of their rated load and also the break specific emission of CO (carbon mono oxide) and other harmful greenhouse gases are found to be lowest at this specific amount of mechanical loading. The proposed controller makes the diesel engine to operate continuously at 80\% of loading in order to ensure an optimum efficiency operation even if the mechanical load is kept changing due to the variations and fluctuations in the ship propulsion load or electrical load. The intelligent control scheme (ICS) uses a battery bank as an energy balancing element to maintain a constant total mechanical loading on the engine shaft using a bidirectional power flow control through the battery bank thus changing effective mechanical loading on the engine for optimum efficiency operation of the marine transportation system. The output mechanical power (P) delivered by the engine on its shaft is sensed using a power sensor and compared with its optimum value in order to calculate the error. Thereafter, based on the information about the error in engine shaft power, the ICS regulates the power flow to the SPAG (single phase asynchronous generator) in such a manner that the mechanical load on the engine is restored to its optimum value immediately. The optimum efficiency operation is maintained under randomly varying mechanical power demanded by the ship propulsion system and it is also maintained under varying electrical loads in the marine transportation system. This ICS scheme has been implemented in the laboratory using a DSP controller. The detailed test results are presented to validate the claims.

AB  - The paper describes the unique combination of technical and operational measures aimed at making a large shipping fleet among the most environmentally focused while ensuring cost-effective operation. These measures are in line with a recently established environmental strategy that applies to the shipping fleet. With the focus on Greenhouse Gases (GHG), CO 2 emission levels and foreseen future trends are provided on the basis of the developments for existing vessels and planned new-buildings, with particular focus on container vessels and tankers. Due to the introduction of new technology, a modernized fleet and focus on fuel efficiency in design and operations, emission levels have decreased significantly over the past years. Despite acknowledging the importance of NOx, SOx and particulate matter as GHG emissions, these are not for primary source consideration in this paper since CO 2 is the main issue in terms of GHG for large shipping companies.

AB  - Marine transportation is the main means of transporting massive goods overseas that cannot be transported using rail or aviation. Using fossil fuels has significantly impacted global warming and changed the climate. This paper focuses on the development of a new hybridized powering system that uses environmentally benign hydrogen-based fuels in five different blends. The proposed powering system is uniquely designed and consists of an internal combustion engine (ICE), gas turbine (GT), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), and thermoelectric generators (TEG). This system is investigated thermodynamically after validating the results with a traditional ICE using marine gas oil (MGO-DMA) fuels. The two traditional ICE engines produce a net power of 21048 kW with a 22.9 % energy efficiency and a 29.0 % exergy efficiency. However, the hybridized GT and ICE system can deliver a maximum power of 27773 kW using a dimethyl-ether and hydrogen fuel blend with a percentage increase of 32 %, while the minimum power is obtained to be 24968 kW (an increase of about 19 %) using methane and hydrogen blend. The addition of SOFC can increase the GT power by double and raise the energy efficiency from 19 % to 32 %. Blending all five fuels, such as hydrogen, methane, dimethyl ether, methanol and ethanol, can drop the specific fuel consumption to 254.5 g/kWh by 21.7 % and raise the total power to 27719.5 by 31.7 %. In addition, the carbon emissions are drastically decreased by about 61 % by utilizing sustainable fuel blends; meanwhile, the overall system performance is increased by more than 35 %.

AB  - Modular multilevel converter (MMC) based flexible direct current transmission technology is an important scheme for the power transmission of distant offshore wind farm, but it presents multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) characteristics. The frequency coupling effect of MIMO characteristics poses a new challenge to the stability of the offshore wind farm-MMC interconnection system. Most of the existing MMC models have ignored the frequency coupling effect, and there are few studies on the key mechanism affecting the frequency coupling effect. In view of the above problems, this paper establishes the equivalent sequence impedance model of MMC on the wind field side, including the frequency coupling effect, and analyzes and evaluated the key factors affecting the frequency coupling effect and stability. Meanwhile, an improved MIMO stability criterion based on Gershgorin-circle theorem is proposed to solve the complicated problem of the existing stability criterion, which simplifies the stability judgment process by introducing the distance function. Then, based on the criterion, the influence of the key factors and the frequency coupling effect on the stability of the system is analyzed, and the conservatism of the criterion is analyzed quantitatively. Finally, a simulation example is given to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis. Â© 2021 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.

AB  - It is not unreasonable to imagine that the future may herald higher energy prices and greater regulation of shipping's Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. With the introduction of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) into MARPOL Annex VI, tools are needed to assist Naval Architects and Marine Engineers to select the best solutions to meet evolving requirements for reduced fuel consumption and associated carbon dioxide emissions. To that end, a concept design tool, the Ship Impact Model (SIM), has been developed for quickly calculating the technical performance of a vessel with one or more Carbon dioxide Reducing Technologies (CRTs) at an early design stage. The underlying basis for this model is the calculation of changes from known 'baseline ships'. The Ship Impact Model has been used in two projects to assess which selection (individual or combination) of Carbon dioxide Reducing Technologies (CRTs) have the most potential, in terms of cost-effectiveness and under other technical, operational and regulatory influences.

JO  - Atmosphere-ocean
PY  - 2004
VL  - 42
IS  - 1
AB  - With increased anthropogenic CO2 emitted into the atmosphere, climate feedbacks could potentially reduce further uptake of carbon by the oceans. The most significant feedbacks acting on the system to reduce carbon sequestration by the oceans are reductions in the thermohaline circulation (THC) and increased sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Although changes in SSTs affect the solubility of atmospheric CO2 across the ocean-atmosphere interface, changes to the THC lead to more fundamental modifications of the ocean circulation and hence transport and storage of carbon to the deep ocean. Using a coupled model of intermediate complexity which incorporates a carbon solubility pump, we project atmospheric CO2 levels under global warming scenarios. A transient weakening of the THC is found in most simulations and increased SSTs are found in all simulations. Although these positive feedbacks act on the carbon system to reduce oceanic uptake, the ocean has the capacity to take up 65-75\% of the anthropogenic CO2 increase once the forcing is turned off. This reduces by about 5\% for each 50-year period that anthropogenic emissions are maintained at a stabilized and elevated atmospheric CO2 level, and converges to zero if the system is forced with stabilized levels well into the future. The effects of climate feedbacks on carbon uptake are also examined and we find that the ocean stores 7\% more carbon when there are no climate feedbacks acting on the system. Sensitivity experiments are conducted with respect to the representation of ocean mixing and sea-ice dynamics. The inclusion of the Gent-McWilliams parametrization for mixing associated with mesoscale eddies leads to a further 6\% increase in oceanic uptake, whereas the inclusion of sea-ice dynamics only leads to a 2\% variation in global uptake.

VL  - 2
IS  - NA
AB  - The continued increase in oil demand associated with the growing concern about the greenhouse gases has been an additional driver for CO2 injection into oil reservoirs. The application of this EOR method usually occurs at a later stage in the development of a field in which the operating surface facilities were normally not specified to manage high levels of CO2. Therefore, the aim of this work is to evaluate, by proper fluid characterization and compositional reservoir simulation, the benefits and risks of CO 2 injection in a particular sector of an offshore reservoir, surrounded by production units not fully specified to deal with elevated concentrations of CO2. The presented workflow, combining reservoir engineering analysis with production equipment aspects, can be applied to any target field for a CO2 injection project. However, it is even more relevant for mature offshore fields, where a CO2 production growth leading to the necessity of replacing all production facilities would probably make the project fail economically. For the particular field analyzed in this article, the deployment of a production unit able to inject CO2 from an external source in an undrained region of the reservoir, hydraulically connected to an area already in production, would bring benefits not only to the region where the injection would occur but also to the adjacent area. The CO2 migration to the neighboring area decreases the levels of CO 2 to be processed in the new platform plant, allowing its technical and economic feasibility, as well as increases the recovery factor of the adjoining area, without reaching levels of CO2 and gas flow rates beyond the limits of the plant already in operation. Furthermore, the reservoir's capacity to retain CO2, acting as a carbon sink, is also evaluated. This study thus presents an integrated workflow for an optimal CO2 injection project design, considering not only the benefits in terms of recovery in the target area of the project, but analyzing the impacts and risks to surrounding areas.

AB  - Regulation of marine bunker fuel was not included in the Kyoto Protocol to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Kyoto Protocol instead provided in Article 2.2 that Annex I countries were to pursue limitation of bunker fuel through the International Maritime Organization (IMO). In 1997 the IMO undertook its first study on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and shipping and in 2009 completed its second study. As part of its work in addressing climate change and international shipping, the IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), at its 60th session, established an Expert Group on Feasibility Study and Impact Assessment of Possible Marketbased Measures (Expert Group). The Expert Group prepared a study that was introduced at MEPC 61. The Expert Group Study assessed ten market-based proposals for reduction of ship-based GHG emissions. These included establishing a Greenhouse Gas Fund, a Leveraged Incentive Scheme to promote increased energy efficiency of ships, establishing a Ship Efficiency and Credit Trading system, a Vessel Efficiency System, and an Emission Trading System for international shipping. The introduction of market-based systems for emission reduction from international shipping introduces a new role for the IMO. In addition, the linkage between the 1992 UNFCCC and IMO Conventions contains elements of interregime conflict, such as, for example, the applicability of the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" (CBDR) of the 1992 UNFCCC and the "no more favourable treatment" (NMFT) of the IMO Conventions. This paper will critically assess the proposed market-based proposals for the reduction of GHG emissions from international shipping within the IMO legal structure and the problems of inter-regime linkage with the UNFCCC system.

AB  - Renewable, low-carbon biofuels offer the potential opportunity to decarbonize marine transportation. This paper presents a comparative techno-economic analysis and process sustainability assessment of four conversion pathways: (1) hydro-thermal liquefaction (HTL) of wet wastes such as sewage sludge and manure; (2) fast pyrolysis of woody biomass; (3) landfill gas Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; and (4) lignin-ethanol oil from the lignocellulosic ethanol biorefinery utilizing reductive catalytic fractionation. These alternative marine biofuels have a modeled minimum fuel selling price between \$1.68 and \$3.98 per heavy fuel oil gallon equivalent in 2016 U.S. dollars based on a mature plant assessment. The selected pathways also exhibit good process sustainability performance in terms of water intensity compared to the petroleum refineries. Further, the O and S contents of the biofuels vary widely. While the non-HTL biofuels exhibit negligible S content, the raw biocrudes via HTL pathways from sludge and manure show relatively high S contents (>0.5 wt \%). Partial or full hydrotreatment can effectively lower the biocrude S content. Additionally, co-feeding with other low-sulfur wet wastes such as food waste can provide another option to produce raw biocrude with lower S content to meet the target with further hydrotreatment. This study indicates that biofuels could be a cost-effective fuel option for the marine sector. Marine biofuels derived from various feedstocks and conversion technologies could mitigate marine biofuel adoption risk in terms of feedstock availability and biorefinery economics.

PY  - 1996
VL  - 48

AB  - Atmospheric transport models are now commonly used to estimate the distribution of sources and sinks of CO2, given atmospheric measurements of this greenhouse gas. Yet, to properly assess large-scale flux patterns, one must employ only those measurements that are representative of large scale air masses. Typically the observed time series are filtered, according to different criteria, as a mean to select baseline conditions. In this paper we raise the problem of comparing selected data with the whole simulated time series. Aiming for better consistency with the observations, we propose four procedures to select the baseline periods in the transport models. Each is tested with a high resolution 3-D model (TM2z), at 3 monitoring stations currently used by the modeling community (Cape Grim, Cape Meares, and Amsterdam Island). Results demonstrate that such selection is necessary, especially for coastal stations. By using information on the synoptic transport as estimated by either 5-days backtrajectories or radon-222 concentrations, the CO2 synoptic scale variability (averaged over the year) is reduced by a factor of three. The seasonal cycle (peak-to-peak amplitude) is also reduced by about 30% for the two coastal stations. With these corrections, the model-data agreement improves dramatically. Moreover, annual averages can be affected by few tenths of ppmv. Finally, we also investigate synoptic events classified as non-baseline both in observations and simulations. The ability of the 3-D model to reproduce some characteristics of these data, points out the potential of such data to characterize the strength of regional fluxes.

AB  - With the continuing increase of offshore wind farm power scale, it is urgent to propose a simplified wind farm model, which aggregates the entire wind farm into single or several aggregated wind turbine generators (WTGs), aiming to save computing resources and improve simulation speed. A novel aggregation algorithm that considers the power loss of offshore submarine cable is proposed, which is different from the traditional wind farm modeling method that adopts amplifying transformer as aggregation medium. Moreover, multi machine aggregation (MMA) algorithm is furtherly proposed to improve the aggregation accuracy. Simulation results verify that the proposed aggregation method can present the dynamic characteristics of wind farm with high accuracy, and can be popularized for other types of wind farm.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has developed new and stricter rules about environmental impact of big vessels. Those rules are going to widen significantly the so called Emission Controlled Areas (ECA) and to generally gain more control over pollution levels over the seas. The solution that most ship-owners are going to prefer is most likely to be the implementation of pollutant emissions reducing systems, such as Scrubbers and Selective Catalytic Reactor Systems, to dampen emissions produced by the present propulsion systems, based on Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) which burns the cheap but polluting Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO). An alternative solution, based on the adoption of Gas Turbines (GT) in the propulsion system, fuelled by Marine Gas Oil (MGO), can be taken into account, allowing considerable savings in weight and space occupied and lover NOx as well as SOx emissions than those of ICEs, even if with a loss in the engine efficiency (Armellini et al., 2018). In this paper, the possibility of using simultaneously ICEs and GTs as well as the use of trigeneration system is analyzed, with the aim of exploiting the positive feature of both the engine systems. The paper provides a quantitative comparison among different hybrid engines configurations (ICEs and GTs working together) making reference to a large cruise ship as a real case. Considering a cruise ship rather than a cargo ship implies an important and time-dependent thermal energy demand, so that an onboard trigeneration system may result a convenient solution.

JO  - Frontiers In Marine Science
PY  - 2019
VL  - 6
IS  - NA
AB  - Stable isotope ratio analysis offers a unique opportunity to obtain information on ecosystem processes. The increase in atmospheric CO2 as a consequence of fossil fuel combustion and land-use change is altering the stable carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of the atmosphere and ocean. This work investigates the application of using delta C-13 measurements of seawater samples to explore the biogeochemical responses of marine ecosystems to anthropogenic CO2 perturbations. The combination of isotopic and non-isotopic measurements from a subtropical North-Atlantic mesocosm experiment provided a holistic view of the biogeochemical mechanisms that affect carbon dynamics under a gradient of pCO(2) ranging from similar to 350 up to similar to 1,000 mu atm during a phytoplankton succession. A clear CO2 response was detected in the isotopic datasets with C-13 shifts of up to similar to 5 parts per thousand, but increased CO2 levels only had a subtle effect on the concentrations of the dissolved and particulate organic carbon pools. Distinctive delta C-13 signatures of the particulate organic carbon pools in the water column and sediment traps were detectable for the different CO2 treatments after a nutrient stimulated phytoplankton bloom. These signatures were strongly correlated (p < 0.05) with the delta C-13 signatures of the inorganic carbon but not with the delta C-13 of the dissolved organic carbon pools (p > 0.05). Fractionation of carbon isotopes in phytoplankton was positively affected (9.6 < epsilon < 16.5 parts per thousand) by high CO2 levels either because of the higher CO2 availability or because of a shift in phytoplankton community composition. Nevertheless, phytoplankton bloom intensity and development was independent of CO2 concentrations, and higher CO2 levels had no significant effect on inorganic nutrient uptake. Results from this mesocosm experiment showed that variations in the carbon isotopic signature of the carbon pools depend on both physical (air-sea exchange) and biological (community composition) drivers opening the door to new approaches for investigations of carbon cycling in marine ecosystems.

AB  - This paper discusses the advantages and challenges of developing offshore wind energy sources for the UK. A revolution that will deliver energy to this generation, and the next, and the next is the one that is indigenous and secure, and where the fuel is free. The new grid needed for 2020 is a strategic, economic highway and it should be built now. At a time of rising input costs it must be more vocal about the local long term economic benefits of wind.

AB  - The Wind Energy Institute of Canada (Institute) owns and operates a 10 MW Wind R&D Park, which includes a 1 MW/2 MWh storage system to be used for innovation in grid integration. Logic controls have been added so the storage system can be used in various use-cases (time-shifting, demand/energy reduction, and diesel displacement). Time-shifting was used for the break-in period to allow the operator to understand the capabilities and develop the necessary logic controls. Demand/energy reduction was implemented to provide power to the turbines to run auxiliary loads during low wind periods. Extended low wind periods caused the battery to fail to meet all the energy needs of the turbines, therefore demand was not reduced and the electricity bill was only reduced by $800. This use-case will be improved by incorporating the wind forecast to prepare and adjust the battery output for extended low wind periods. In January 2015 the Institute, in partnership with the local utility, discharged the storage during periods of high load and low wind when the undersea cable reached its import limit. During these periods, the utility uses expensive diesel generators to off-load the cable. Therefore discharging the Institute's storage system provided on-island generation when it was needed most. Six discharges were performed over the month with 10.6 MWhs of high value electricity entering the grid. The Institute is currently testing frequency regulation and looks forward to using its utility size lab for the renewable energy industry, battery producers, academia, utilities, system operators and other partners.

TI  - The potential for desalination technologies in meeting the water crisis: Comments
JO  - Water Crisis: Myth Or Reality Marcelino Botin Water Forum 2004
PY  - 2006
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - These notes add some comments to the chapter by Uche et al. (this volume) on desalinizated water use. The comments do not refer to the desalinization techniques themselves. Raw water for desalination is often coastal seawater, but also brackish and saline groundwaters, both in coastal and inland emplacements. Treated sewage water, and also brackish water from other sources, such as return irrigation flows, are susceptible of being desalinized. Desalinization technology and costs have improved dramatically in the last few decades with respect to specific energy consumption, the processes themselves, the materials, and the membranes when they are used. But in spite of a current, fairly well known, and proven technology, information on water costs remains uncertain for people and even for policy-makers due to diverse intervening economic parameters, and how they are modified to yield to social pressure and political goals. The relative low cost of water storage implies that under normal circumstances the most economic way of operating a desalinization plant is continuously at nominal capacity. Return flows from a desalinization plant must be safely disposed of and this adds significantly to water cost. Desalinization is an energy and capital intensive process, as are also long water transfers and tertiary treatment of waste water. Produced water cost therefore is intrinsically expensive, more for seawater than for brackish water. It becomes a new water resource in areas and for uses that can support high prices and have water resources at hand to be desalinized. However, this is not a resource for poor areas or for water intensive processes except if heavily subsidized. Under normal circumstances desalinization is just one more alternative for water supply to be considered among others.

Different types of cable and transformer modelling techniques are taken into consideration, e.g. state-of-the-art standard models and latest academic developments. The models are compared based on system-level studies in a real-life large offshore wind power plant. It is shown that the use of detailed cable and transformer models increases the overall damping estimation in the system, and therefore improves the resonance characteristics and small-signal stability margins of the investigated wind power plant.

VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - The Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) was introduced as a regulatory tool employed at the ship design phase to reduce the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and increase the vessel's operational efficiency. Although it stimulated the greening of the shipping operations, its effectiveness is considerably criticised from various shipping industry stakeholders. The aim of this study is to investigate the EEDI effectiveness on accurately representing the environmental performance of the next-generation ships power plants for two representative ship types, in specific, an ocean-going tanker and a cruise ship. The performance of the optimal power plant solutions identified in previous studies is analysed according to the existing EEDI regulatory framework and compared with the lifetime CO2 emissions estimated based on an actual operating profile for each ship. The results indicate that the EEDI underestimates the effect of technologies for reducing carbon emissions in all the investigated cases. In this respect, it is concluded that EEDI is classified as a conservative metric, which however can be used as an approximation to compare alternative solutions early in the design phase.

IS  - JANUARY
AB  - The DNV's new Triality tanker design, which incorporates a new hull geometry with existing technology that could reduce CO2 emissions substantially, is presented. The fuel that the new ship should use is LNG. Maersk's manager of the innovations department of Gunnyar Bjornsson, who is a naval architect and master mariner and specializes in the use of LNG as a fuel, was impressed by the hull design and the ballast free elements of the concept vessel. However, although Ms Grimstad Osberg conceded that LNG is not the only answer to the maritime sector's emissions conundrum, the fuel would reduce CO2 by around 34% while particulates and SOx would be reduced by 94%, NOx by 82%, and VOC by 100%. Triality is already fitted with some innovative systems that would improve its energy efficiency, e.g., using the low temperature of the LNG fuel, which is stored under pressure in two 6750 cu m tanks at -163Â°C, to cool the ignition temperature of the main engines, reducing NOx emissions, and improving efficiency.

AB  - Renewable-energy power-generation systems are garnering attention as a means to combat climate change and provide stable energy sources. The power generated by tidal currents is predictable, which offers advantages when used in conjunction with a power grid; tidal power is also unaffected by weather. This study considers a tidal current power-generation system using a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) under variable-speed operation. Previous study has investigated the gear ratio and the capacity of the generator to produce the maximum annual energy while the system is operated at a constant turbine-output control scheme. This evaluation has been performed for considering a constant stator d-axis current of -0.93 pu. It is essential to consider the influence of the stator d-axis current. The purpose of this study is to investigate this dependence for a tidal current power-generation system using a DFIG. The capacity factor changes with a constant stator d-axis current. Â© 2020 IEEE.

JO  - Science Of The Total Environment
PY  - 2018
VL  - 631-632
IS  - NA
AB  - Navigational dredging is an excavation of marine/freshwater sediment to maintain channels of sufficient depth for shipping safety. Due to historical inputs of anthropogenic contaminants, sediments are often contaminated by metals/metalloids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and other contaminants. Its disposal can present significant environmental and financial burdens. This study developed a novel and green remediation method for contaminated sediment using stabilization/solidification with calcium-rich/low-calcium industrial by-products and CO2 utilization. The hydration products were evaluated by quantitative X-ray diffraction analysis and thermogravimetric analysis. The incorporation of calcium carbide residue (CCR) facilitated hydration reaction and provided relatively high 7-d strength. In contrast, the addition of Class-F pulverized fly ash (PFA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) was beneficial to the 28-d strength development due to supplementary pozzolanic and hydration reactions. The employment of 1-d CO2 curing was found to promote strength development (98%) and carbon sequestration (4.3 wt%), while additional 7-d air curing facilitated cement rehydration and further carbonation in the sediment blocks. The leachability tests indicated that all studied binders, especially CCR binder, effectively immobilized contaminants in the sediments. The calcium-rich CCR and GGBS were regarded as promising candidates for augmenting the efficacy of CO2 curing, whereas GGBS samples could be applicable as eco-paving blocks in view of their superior 28-d strength. This study presents a new and sustainable way to transform contaminated sediment into value-added materials. Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article describes the screening, ranking and characterization of ultramafic and mafic rocks in southern Portugal for mineral carbonation as an alternative to conventional CO2 storage in sedimentary rocks. A set of criteria including mineralogy, structure, surface area, distance to CO2 sources, expected volume, and socioeconomic conditions was applied to screen ultramafic and mafic rock massifs in the Alentejo region, southern Portugal. Ranking of the massifs indicated that the plutonic massifs of Sines and of TorrÃ£o-Odivelas were the most promising. A characterization was made of the Sines massif, a subvolcanic massif composed mostly of gabbros and diorites, located immediately adjacent to the CO2 sources and outcropping along 300 km2 onshore and offshore. These studies confirmed that these rock samples exhibited the appropriate mineralogical and geochemical features, but also indicated that the secondary porosity provided by the fracture patterns was very small.

JO  - Ieee Transactions On Power Systems

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - All-electric and hybrid-electric ships have become the centerpiece for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving fuel efficiency in the maritime industry. Real-time power management of multiple power sources in both design and operation becomes critical due to the uncertainty and randomness of the vessel&#x0027;s power demand. Furthermore, the vessel operators may have additional requirements for operational flexibility, such as fully recharging the battery before the next trip and limiting engine switch on/off to reduce wear-and-tear, which lead to complex power management systems requiring domain-expert knowledge. In this paper, a hybrid solution for real-time power management is proposed. The model-based approach encapsulates the power system, and the data-driven approach (a machine learning technique called Markov approximation) handles the uncertainty. First, an offline deterministic optimization problem for power management is formulated. Second, the deterministic problem is transformed into a maximum weighted independent set (MWIS) problem. Next, the Markov approximation framework is applied to the transformed problem to utilize the machine learning techniques widely used in wireless communications and computing industries. Finally, a reinforcement learning-based real-time solution is proposed. Extensive simulations are performed on a ferry case study, and the results are within the proven theoretical bounds of machine learning techniques. IEEE

TI  - Biomimetic mineralization and characterization of hierarchically structured hydrated magnesium carbonates: The effects of sodium alginate
JO  - Journal Of Co2 Utilization
PY  - 2022
VL  - 56
IS  - NA
AB  - Recently, CO2 mineralization involving magnesium salt provides a feasible way for carbon sequestration. The produced hydrated magnesium carbonates (HMCs) can be used as functional materials and will bring huge economic benefits. Inspired by the mineralization in biological organisms, the indirect CO2 mineralization process involving NH4HCO3-MgCl2 in the presence of sodium alginate (SA) was systematically investigated. XRD, SEM, FTIR, TG and XPS were used to characterize the crystal phase, morphology, structure and surface of HMCs. By the regulation of temperature, HMCs with a complex hierarchical structure were successfully synthesized, i.e., sea urchin-like nesquehonite assembled by nanorods and 3D spiderweb-like hydromagnesite assembled by nanosheets. The presence of SA inhibits the phase transition from nesquehonite to hydromagnesite, and the inhibitory effect increases as the concentration of SA increases. By decreasing the molar ratio of Mg2+/HCO3âˆ’, the shape of nesquehonite particle changes from a sphere to an ellipsoid or a gourd. The spherical structure of nesquehonite is destroyed in a weak alkaline solution and the crystalline product is flower-like hydromagnesite in a strong alkaline solution. The decomposition process of HMCs is composed of dehydration (or dehydration and dehydroxylation) stage and decarbonation stage. XPS results for nesquehonite and hydromagnesite are quite different due to their different surface structure. This study will provide insights into the preparation of hierarchically structured HMCs by indirect CO2 mineralization and promote added values of HMCs by biomimetic mineralization method.

TI  - Total fuel-cycle emissions for marine vessels: A Well-to-Hull Analysis with Case Study

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Regional and global air pollution emissions from marine transportation is a growing concern. In discerning the sources of such pollution, researchers have become interested in tracking where along the total fuel cycle these emissions occur. In addition, new efforts to introduce alternative fuels in marine vessels have raised new questions about the energy use and environmental impacts of such fuels. To address these issues, this paper presents the Total Energy & Emissions Analysis for Marine Systems (TEAMS) model. TEAMS can be used to analyze total fuel-cycle emissions and energy use from marine vessels. TEAMS captures â€œwell-to-hullâ€ emissionsâ€”that is, emissions along the entire fuel pathway, including extraction, processing, distribution, and use in vessels. TEAMS conducts analyses for six fuel pathways: (1) petroleum to residual oil; (2) petroleum to conventional diesel; (3) petroleum to low-sulfur diesel; (4) natural gas to compressed natural gas; (5) natural gas to Fischer-Tropsch diesel; and, (6) soybeans to biodiesel. TEAMS calculates total fuel-cycle emissions of three greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane) and five criteria pollutants (volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of 10 micrometers or less, and sulfur oxides). TEAMS also calculates total energy consumption, fossil fuel consumption, and petroleum consumption associated with each of its six fuel cycles. TEAMS can be used to study emissions from a variety of user-defined vessels. This paper provides modeling results for a passenger ferry case study using alternative fuels.

AB  - Based on current growth patterns in the global economy, there are projections that there will be an overall increase in the emissions of harmful gases from ships. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) requires the preparation of management plans to improve the efficiency of ship navigation. Moreover, shipping companies should pay careful attention to fuel consumption and environmental conservation. In this paper, we propose a newly developed weather-routing optimization technology that focuses on fuel-consumption minimization and energy-efficiency operational indicator (EEOI) minimization while on voyages. We consider the constant variations in the sea and weather conditions, including wind, wave, and current conditions. This is achieved by performing a cost-function minimization. The cost function is calculated by performing an entire maneuvering simulation from a transoceanic voyage's starting point to its end point by solving horizontal differential equations of motion such as those related to the yaw, sway, and surge. The simulations consider the ship's hull force, propeller thrust, rudder force, wave force, and wind force. Both sets of results obtained in this study for the optimal routes are reasonable because the values of EEOI and FOC are reduced compared with the values for the great circle route, which is the shortest path between the two points. On the other hand, the optimized route in the EEOI minimization calculation does not provide the FOC minimum value.

AB  - In an attempt to curb air pollution from the shipping industry, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed two new sets of standards in July 2009, requiring ships that have compression-ignition engines with a capacity of 30 liters or more per cylinder in U.S. waters to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NO x) emissions by 15%-25% by 2011, and by up to 80% by 2016 from the current level. The stringent new standards will force shipping operators to invest in more efficient and cleaner engine and emission reduction technologies. This paper summarized some potential solutions for emissions reduction from large cargo ships, including selective catalytic reduction technology for NOx reduction, blending of biofuel with heavy fuel oil, application of oxygenates in marine diesel fuel, sea water scrubbing for SOx reduction, and plasma technology for emissions reduction.

AB  - Amongst, the floating systems catering to the offshore wind energy, barge floater is the simplest structure but its limitation of application is constrained by its large motion. Mitigating these motions can help in efficient and economical production of energy. The present work focuses on the experiments conducted on a 1:50 scaled model of a barge without and with static Offshore Wind Turbine (OWT) with active gyrostabilizer â€˜offâ€™ and â€˜onâ€™ condition for regular and irregular waves for three different rpms. The roll responses were recorded for a range of regular wave heights from 2 cm to 5.5 cm and time periods varying from 0.8 to 1.3 s and irregular waves with significant wave height from 3 cm to 5 cm with peak period ranging from 0.8 to 1.25 s. For barge, the maximum motion reduction observed was 60% and for barge fitted with static OWT the maximum reduction observed was 55% at higher rpm in regular waves. In case of irregular waves, significant response heights were compared. For barge, the maximum response reduction observed was 50% and for barge fitted with static OWT the maximum response reduction observed was 54% in irregular waves. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Natural gas hydrate (NGH) is a new clean energy, which is stored in the deep-sea sediments or the permafrost. Gas production from the NGH reservoir by injecting CO 2 has been known as an economic and environmental-friendly method. Thermodynamics and dynamics researches have proved that it is feasible to exploit NGH by CO 2 injection. The reaction is a spontaneous process, which is dominated by diffusion. Meanwhile, many other factors, such as the environment of NGH reservoir, the content of gas, the phase of CO 2 injected, also have influence on the process. The mechanism of the replacement process including the micro-phenomenon of the reaction, the phase transformation and the factors affecting the reaction rate and the recovery efficiency have been investigated. The effective safety design of the replacement reaction has been proposed. The results can provide experimental data and theory foundation for the capture of the greenhouse gas and the exploitation of the NGH reservoir.

JO  - Earth Surface Processes And Landforms
PY  - 2020
VL  - 45
IS  - 11
AB  - Growing evidence suggests microbial respiration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may be a principal driver of subsurface dissolution and cave formation in eogenetic carbonate rock. Analyses of samples of vadose zone gasses, and geochemical and hydrological data collected from shallow, uncased wells on San Salvador Island, Bahamas, suggest tidally varying water tables may help fuel microbial respiration and dissolution through oxygenation. Respiration of soil organic carbon transported to water tables generates dysaerobic to anaerobic groundwater, limiting aerobic microbial processes. Positive correlations of carbon dioxide (CO2), radon-222 (222Rn) and water table elevation indicate, however, that tidal pumping of water tables pulls atmospheric air that is rich in oxygen, and low in CO2 and 222Rn, into contact with the tidal capillary fringe during falling tides. Ratios of CO2 and O2 in vadose gas relative to the atmosphere indicate this atmospheric oxygen fuels respiration within newly-exposed, wetted bedrock. Deficits of expected CO2 relative to O2 concentrations indicate some respired CO2 is likely removed by carbonate mineral dissolution. Tidal pumping also appears capable of transferring oxygen to the freshwater lens, where it could also contribute to respiration and dissolution; dissolved oxygen concentrations at the water table are at least 5% saturated and decline to anaerobic conditions 1â€“2 m below. Our results demonstrate how tidal pumping of air to vadose zones can drive mineral dissolution reactions that are focused near water tables and may contribute to the formation of laterally continuous vuggy horizons and potentially caves.

TI  - Determining a required energy efficiency design index level for new ships based on a cost effectiveness criterion
JO  - Maritime Policy And Management
PY  - 2010
VL  - 37
IS  - 2
AB  - The maritime industry is expected to contribute to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reductions, and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is working on possible ways of regulating shipping's GHG emissions. One possible instrument is the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). However, there is no agreement on a mandatory application or how to set the required targets. This article presents an approach where a required index level (IR) can be determined through a cost-effectiveness assessment of the available reduction measures. A decision criterion of 50 USD per tonne CO2-eq. averted is used, based on a 2Â°C stabilisation level target. For illustration purposes, eleven emission reduction measures are analysed for implementation on a representative ship, and the IR is reached after applying the measures fulfilling the decision criterion. Using the same principles, other regulatory requirements such as a cap on emissions from shipping, e.g. for use in a shipping emissions trading scheme, can be developed. Using a cost-effectiveness approach in setting a IR or determining a cap will avoid prescriptive regulations detailing specific measures to be implemented, and the costs imposed by new requirements may be justified on the basis of the achievable emission reductions and cross-sector potential for achieving a global reduction target.

TI  - Diurnal and semidiurnal variability of coastal wind over Taiwanese waters
JO  - Wind Energy
PY  - 2015
VL  - 18
IS  - 8
AB  - The Taiwan Strait is rich in offshore wind energy. Developing offshore wind farms is vital for renewable energy development. Rapid variations in the speed of offshore wind affect the capacity and operations of wind farms. On the basis of the demand for developing offshore wind farms in Taiwanese waters, this study examined in situ coastal wind data and documented the characteristics of the diurnal and semidiurnal oscillations in surface wind as well as the seasonal and spatial characteristics of these oscillations. Wavelet-based rotary spectral analysis and significance level theory were adopted to quantify the occurrence probability and intensity of diurnal and semidiurnal wind fields. The occurrence probability of semidiurnal variations was approximately 50% greater than that of diurnal variations across Taiwan, with persistent occurrence of such variations near the southwest coast. The intensity of the diurnal phenomena was twice that of the semidiurnal phenomena, reaching an average of 27% of the wind energy variation at the potential sites located in Western Taiwan. Diurnal wind velocity oscillations were most intense during the fall but declined as the latitude moved from north to south. The instantaneous rotary spectrum was used to estimate the ellipticity of the wind vector. The analysis indicated that diurnal wind was dominated by land-sea breezes. Moreover, the semidiurnal wind was less influenced by surface thermal effects than by diurnal phenomena. The effects of these phenomena on offshore wind energy conversion are considerable and should not be ignored. Â© 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 18
IS  - 1
AB  - Changes in weather patterns are now recorded more and more frequently in various locations of the Earth. Collective action is needed to deal with the challenges of climate change; the maritime industry must contribute its fair share to those activities, aiming to mitigate a risk that can threaten humanity's own existence. On the positive side, both the European Union (EU) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have clear ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships that are linked to climate change, and two similar albeit separate regimes have been introduced. EU's monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) regulation of CO2 emissions has already been influencing shipping activities, since the related data collection has started on the 1st of January 2018. The second initiative is the IMO's data collection system (DCS), which revolves primarily around fuel consumption; the necessary data collection started on the 1st of January 2019. To support an effective environmental performance management framework for the maritime industry, it is necessary to create a robust database that describes all aspects of energy efficient ship operations, with an emphasis on the inventory of CO2 emitted from ships. The analysis at hand examines the challenges in the relevant data collection scheme, with a particular focus on MRV, considering that the specific regulation is already operationalized. An online survey was conducted among maritime professionals in Singapore and Bangladesh to examine the gap between current energy-related regulations/policies and standing operational practices. The findings address the issues relating to shipping operations and certain compliance, institutional and management matters. They also identify the industry's preparedness for this new policy framework of environmental performance management as well as the impact on existing energy efficiency practices. A very important conclusion derived is that the quality of data collected is crucial for the effective management of emissions related to shipping and the associated fuel consumption.

TI  - Integrated Dynamics Response Analysis for IEA 10-MW Spar Floating Offshore Wind Turbine
JO  - Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering
PY  - 2022
VL  - 10
IS  - 4
AB  - Wind energy in the deep-sea area is more abundant and the capacity of wind turbines can be made larger. Therefore, the research on deep-sea floating offshore wind turbines will be the primary strategy for wind energy exploitation in the future. The spar-type platform depends on the characteristics of a small water plane, deep draft, and good stability, which has been applied to the commercial development of deep-sea wind energy. In the next ten years, the 10-MW wind turbine will become the mainstream class installed in the floating offshore wind turbine farm. Thus, it is very necessary to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth study on the 10-MW spar type floating offshore wind turbine. The direct-drive 10-MW offshore wind turbine was proposed by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in Wind Task 37 in 2019. In this paper, a spar-type platform is designed to support the IEA 10-MW reference wind turbines, and a nonlinear aero-hydro-servo-elastic numerical model is established using the FAST tool (which is developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL). Then, the accuracy of the wind turbine and the sensitivity of the controller are verified, and the natural periods of the floating offshore wind turbine are obtained by free-decay tests. The natural periods of the platform in six degrees-of-freedom are found to be within the range recommended by the design standard. The measured wind and wave data of the target site close to Fujian Province of China are used to evaluate the performance of the floating offshore wind turbine under the 100-, 50-, 5-, and 2-year-return stochastic weather conditions. The results indicate that the design of the spar platform is reasonable and has excellent hydrodynamic performance.

Simulation results show that the oscillation mode is related to the penetration of wind farm. Different kinds of wind turbine models are considered. Simulation results show that the detailed wind turbine model brings new oscillation mode related to the wind turbine itself.

AB  - Although wave energy prototypes have been proposed for more than 100 years, they have still not reached full commercialisation. The reasons for this are varied, but include the diversity of device operating principles, the variety of onshore/nearshore/offshore deployment possibilities, the diversity of the wave climate at various potential wave energy sites, and the consequent lack of convergence in technology and consensus. This distributed effort has, in turn, lead to a slow rate of progression up the learning curve, with a significant number of wave energy company liquidations and technical setbacks dampening investor confidence. Although a number of reviews on wave energy technology are already in the published literature, such a dynamic environment merits an up-to-date analysis and this review examines the wave energy landscape from a technological, research and commercial perspective.

AB  - In this study, several process alternatives for the permanent sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) as solid carbonates are evaluated. Although the formation of mineral carbonates is thermodynamically favourable, it does not occur significantly due to kinetic limitations and the formation of products that hinder the evolution of the process. Several biological organisms, including corals, have developed different mechanisms for accelerating the process and managing undesirable products. In this report, we propose biomimicking approaches to precipitate solid carbonates while limiting the amount of energy required or using the produced by-products to generate valuable materials. A few processes alternatives are described and evaluated in this study. In all these explored cases CO2 mineralization requires divalent cations such as Ca++ or Mg++. These could be sourced from sea water or land based silicates containing these cations. Sea-water based source results in two attractive options, namely: 1. electrochemically assisted precipitation of carbonates with production of sales of Cl2 or HCl; 2. electrochemically assisted precipitation of carbonates and production of Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM) and polymerization into Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), with sales of PVC; the land based source results in further in options 3, and 4: 3. electrochemically assisted precipitation of carbonates with in-situ mining of silicates; and 4. ammonia assisted precipitation of carbonates with in-situ mining of silicates. This study explores the technical feasibility of these options further. Copyright 2016, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - An integrated framework of drivetrain degradation assessment and fault localization for offshore wind turbines
JO  - International Journal Of Prognostics And Health Management
PY  - 2013
VL  - 4
IS  - SPECIAL ISSUE 2
AB  - As wind energy proliferates in onshore and offshore applications, it has become significantly important to predict wind turbine downtime and maintain operation uptime to ensure maximal yield. Two types of data systems have been widely adopted for monitoring turbine health condition: supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) and condition monitoring system (CMS). Provided that research and development have focused on advancing analytical techniques based on these systems independently, an intelligent model that associates information from both systems is necessary and beneficial. In this paper, a systematic framework is designed to integrate CMS and SCADA data and assess drivetrain degradation over its lifecycle. Information reference and advanced feature extraction techniques are employed to procure heterogeneous health indicators. A pattern recognition algorithm is used to model baseline behavior and measure deviation of current behavior, where a Self-organizing Map (SOM) and minimum quantization error (MQE) method is selected to achieve degradation assessment. Eventually, the computation and ranking of component contribution to the detected degradation offers component-level fault localization. When validated and automated by various applications, the approach is able to incorporate diverse data resources and output actionable information to advise predictive maintenance with precise fault information. The approach is validated on a 3 MW offshore turbine, where an incipient fault is detected well before existing system shuts down the unit. A radar chart is used to illustrate the fault localization result.

AB  - Annual emissions from maritime transport are contributing to the acceleration of global climate change and deteriorating local air quality. Shipowners need information on current and new emission reduction solutions to compare cost-effectiveness and environmental impact. However, emissions reduction in the maritime sector is a complex issue that should also consider the environmental impacts during fuel production as well as the full impact of different options during use. In this study, different fuel options and emission reduction methods are compared to rank the overall sustainability of alternatives. The overall sustainability assessment is based on the economic and environmental indexes generated, weighted, and aggregated. The results show that the sustainability index of LNG is often the best of the options compared. The difference in fuel prices determines much of the difference in economic performance between fuels. The results emphasize the importance of including several criteria when comparing more sustainable alternatives in shipping. Â© 2023 the Author(s).

AB  - Carbon emissions have always been a key issue in agricultural production. Due to the specific natural factors in the soil of saline agriculture, there are distinctive characteristics in saline agricultural production as compared with traditional agricultural zones. Here, we have adopted the theory of life cycle assessment and employed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) greenhouse gas (GHG) field calculation to estimate the GHG emissions, derived from the staple crop productions (i.e., barley, wheat, corn and rice). In addition, our study further analyzed the main driving forces of carbon emissions and proposed some effective measures to reduce them. Our results have showed that: (1) carbon footprint from the four crops in the study area varies from 0.63 to 0.77 kg CO2 eq.kg(-1), which is higher than that from traditional agriculture; (2) GHG emissions from Fertilizer-Nitrogen (N) manufacture and inorganic N application have contributed to the greatest percentage of carbon footprint. Compared with traditional agricultural zones, fertilizer-N application and paddy irrigation involved with crop productions have overall greater contributions to carbon footprint; (3) carbon emissions from saline agriculture can be reduced significantly by planting-breeding combination to reduce the amount of N fertilizer application, improving the traditional rotation system, and developing water-saving agriculture and ecological agriculture.

Due to the complexity of multiple power resources coordination, varied propulsion loads, changeable economical, and environmental requirements, power/energy management system (PMS/EMS) becomes essential in both designing and operational processes. The existing literature on PMS/EMS can be categorized into rule-based and optimization-based approaches. Compared to the rule-based PMS/EMS, which relies heavily on human expertise, as well as predefined strategies and priorities, the optimization-based approaches can offer more efficient solutions and are more widely used nowadays. This article provides a comprehensive review of the marine optimization-based power/energy management system and discusses the future trends of PMS/EMS in ship power systems.

AB  - The floating photovoltaic system is a new concept in the renewable energy technology. That is similar to land based photovoltaic technology except floating system. So the system needs buoyant objects, mooring, ect, besides modules and supports, and that is able to withstand in water level changes and wind strength. Therefore the floating photovoltaic system is much different from land photovoltaic system. K-water (Korea Water Resources Corporation) has been operating two floating photovoltaic system that's capacity is 100 ãŽ¾ and 500 ãŽ¾ respectively since in summer 2011 for commercial generation, and have construction project for 2,000 ãŽ¾ in Boryeong multipurpose Dam and other areas. Furthermore K-water was developing a tracking-type floating photovoltaic system at Daecheong multipurpose Dam and developed and installed an ocean floating photovoltaic demonstration plant at Sihwa Lake in October 2013 for R&D. In this paper, we introduce that structure of floating photovoltaic system include buoyant structure, mooring system and auxiliary device. Especially the rope which is in part of mooring should be always maintain tension under any water level. Also we explain about structure design concept to wind load in an every loading condition and a kind of structure materials and PV structure types used in water environment. Especially ocean floating PV system is affected by tidal current and typhoon. So there are considering the elements in design. Finally we compare with floating and land photovoltaic on power amount. As a result of that we verified the floating photovoltaic system is more about 6.6~14.2 % efficiency than a general land photovoltaic system. Copyright The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.

AB  - Nowadays, in the case of the coastal structures, wave breaking and access to clean energy are two important issues, which can be addressed by combining breakwater and vibration-based energy harvesting systems. In this study, the mechanical energy which is produced when ocean wave breaks into a vertical face is converted into electrical energy. To accomplish this, a new low-volume piezoelectric beam-column energy harvesting system is proposed. To study the application of this system, a theoretical model is presented and studied analytically. The analytical model is updated using experimental data and it is shown that the analytical results were similar to the experimental results after updating. After validating the electromechanical model, an energy harvesting system is presented, which can produce energy from breaking ocean waves on a vertical face. Four possible conceptual designs for energy harvesting systems are considered and the so-called Perfection Rate (PR) is introduced to select the best model to maximize harvested energy whilst mitigating the deteriorating effects of large strain deformation.

AB  - A system for biofuel farming in coastal deserts is presently under investigation in a cooperative European project. The biomass production is based on seawater which is pumped through shallow artificial ponds. Due to the high productivity of phytoplankton, easy fermentation to methane, and complete recycling of mineral nutrients, the net energy balance (output/input) is expected to be 14 for methane and 7 for methanol, respectively. Since neither fertile land nor fresh water is needed, there is no competition with food production on arable land. Such a system is entirely energy self contained, which makes it attractive for remote desert areas and developing countries. During the first two years of collaboration on this project the feasibility of all crucial steps could be demonstrated: productivities of 60-90 t dry matter ha-1 year-1 obtained in southern Italy, a cheap method of pond construction, harvesting, fermentation, and recycling of the sludge.

This design originates from the oscillating water column (OWC) type WEC but replaces the pneumatic power take off (PTO) through the Wells turbine with the hydrodynamic PTO through the inside heaving cylinder. To effectively evaluate the maximum power output, the system has been modeled in the hydrodynamic software AQWA (developed by ANSYS Inc) that has accumulated extensive offshore industry users. Ranges of the PTO parameters have been examined to make sure that proper linear damping can be implemented to simulate the PTO force. Comparing the efficiency of the pneumatic PTO with the hydrodynamic PTO, it appears that the hydrodynamic PTO is more promising than the traditional Wells turbine for an OWC system.

The optimal design problem enables an automatic design process which minimizes the primary steel mass of the jacket and the foundations. Both leg distance and soil stiffness are found to have a significant influence on the total mass as well as the first natural frequency of the full offshore wind turbine structure. The results indicate that an integrated design approach is valuable in the conceptual design phase. Firstly, the soil characteristics and foundation type have a significant influence on the optimal leg distance for the jacket.

AB  - Can you imagine that when you slide on the polymer plate with your hands, the generated electromagnetic field can drive 28-watt fluorescent tube lamps and can even charge the mobile phone? The progress of science and technology subverts traditional cognition. Here, an easy and efficient power generator (EEPG) with ultrahigh voltage is invented, which can light up 28-watt fluorescent tube lamps. The average output voltage and current of planar EEPG can reach up to nearly 5000 V and 116 mu A, respectively. Not only can it be used for lighting, but also for charging, and even for mobile phones. The rotary EEPG can be used to harvest wind energy and tidal energy, which overcomes the shortcomings of traditional electromagnetic wind power generation working only when the wind speed is greater than 5 m/s. In addition, the EEPG power generator can be utilized as a footswitch and trajectory tracking tool. This is likely to become an easy and effective method of power generation in the world. It can be expected that mobile phones can be charged by just rubbing their backs. Collecting the green wind energy more easily and efficiently will be truly realized.

JO  - Journal Of Mechanical Engineering Research And Developments
PY  - 2021
VL  - 44
IS  - 4
AB  - Diesel engines remain the most widely used option to power a wide variety of transport ships. In terms of the maximum installed volume of all shipping vessels, 96% of this energy is generated from diesel engines. Due to the lack of alternative propulsion systems with the same energy density, cost, and fuel efficiency as diesel engines, it is not expected that marine diesel engines will be replaced within an expected 100 years. Modern large diesel engines are about 50% efficient in using the burning thermal energy of the fuel and the rest is lost to the environment as waste heat. The efficient use of waste heat energy can enhance the power system efficiency and reduce emissions, by using a dedicated waste heat recovery system for power generation or heating needs. Technologies that recover waste heat from engines have been around for 30 years, but recovery efficiency, cost of installation, and the ability to take up space in engine room space have caused certain obstacles. This paper conducts a brief review of the techniques and prospects of emerging waste heat recovery technologies from marine diesel engines. The results achieved would be useful suggestions for ship managers and owners in equipping marine fleets with waste heat recovery systems to meet the increasingly stringent IMO requirements for energy efficiency and environmental protection.

AB  - The current usage of the term 'hybrid electric power', when referring to electrical networks installed on offshore and marine assets refers to the coupling of energy transformation systems (ETS) that utilize different technologies to exchange energy with the electrical network. An ETS is composed of an energy transformation device (ETD) and if necessary an energy converter that is utilized to match the electrical characteristics of the ETD to those of the electrical network; the converter facilitates the exchange of energy between the ETD and the electrical network at the required rate. An ETS may also be known as a source if it capable of supplying net positive energy to the electrical network for consumption by the loads. Energy exchange between the electrical network and the ETD may be unidirectional or bi-directional. Bi-directional energy exchange implies that the ETD has energy absorption capability. Energy absorption can manifest itself most economically with energy storage capability, alternately it may manifest itself as the ability to dissipate energy. Not all ETS that have energy storage capability may operate bi-directionally. Unidirectional ETS's include the 'traditional generators' utilizing combustion based diesel engine, gas turbine or boiler + steam turbine prime movers as well as 'alternate ETS' such as fuel cells and primary batteries that also have energy storage capability. Unidirectional ETS such as wind turbine generators and solar energy do not have energy storage capability as we commonly understand it. Bi-directional ETD's include secondary batteries, capacitors and flywheels. Hybrid electric power systems offer the opportunity to improve safety, reliability, operational efficiency and reduce fuel rate, environmental footprint and maintenance costs when compared to traditional electrical power systems.

TI  - New source bias: Environmental policy risks raising emissions in maritime shipping
JO  - Sname Maritime Convention, Smc 2018
PY  - 2018
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - In terms of environmental improvements, maritime shipping and its regulators (IMO in particular) are perfectly positioned for an unprecedented example of new source bias. New source bias is a tendency that environmental policies typically are introduced in ways (standards, for instance) that a) work more forcefully on new equipment than on old and b) raises the costs of new equipment and thereby c) raises the expected lifetime of existing equipment, and the intensity of its use. For maritime shipping, regulatory policies such as IMOâ€™s Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) will raise the costs of new-buildings (for a given freight capacity) and reduce emissions from those, but will also delay their introduction, and thus prolong the active lives and raise speed for existing vessels. This raises emissions from existing vessels, and more than proportionally to their output in terms of ton-miles. We present illustrative calculations â€“ the intermediate period with higher emissions caused by the regulation may be long â€“ and suggest what a more complete set of policy instruments would aim for and look like. The reasons for our concern that new source bias will be stronger in maritime shipping than in many other sectors are: a) the speed-fuel equation which allows emissions to rise more than proportionally to capacity utilization; b) the idea â€“ weakly founded, in our view â€“ that â€˜mare libreâ€™ makes it harder to regulate existing vessels and operations than new designs; c) lifetimes of assets in shipping, which are not only long but responsive to market conditions. This latter observation is partly because important shipping market segments presently have high capacity relative to demand, and a young fleet, which can serve demand for an extensive period.

AB  - A team of researchers in the Queen's University Ionic Liquid Laboratories (QUILL) Research Centre at Queen's University Belfast has developed an innovative technology that uses a mixture of water and ionic liquids to remove CO2 from raw natural gas extracted from natural reservoirs under the sea. The new ionic liquid system is compact enough to be used on offshore platforms or installed on land-based gas-processing plants. Once captured, the CO2 may be stored, reprocessed, or used for enhanced oil recovery. This new technology is safer, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly than conventional amine purifying systems. The process is intended to reduce the global environmental and economic costs of purifying natural gas, the cleanest burning fuel available in large amounts.

JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2022
VL  - 249
IS  - NA
AB  - Several energy-saving methods have been implemented on ships to improve propulsion efficiency, reducing fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. The Gate Rudder System, as a novel energy-saving and maneuvering device, reduces fuel consumption by up to 14% compared to the conventional flap rudder system, as confirmed by the sea trial test of a container ship with a gate rudder system. The power savings achieved by the ship with the Gate Rudder system exceeded projections based on model tests. With the motivation of evaluating this discrepancy, this research aims to investigate the propulsive performance of a cargo ship with a gate rudder system as well as the scale effects on its performance, considering two different models of 3 m and 6 m in length, as well as a full-scale ship of 69 m in length. RANSE-based CFD analyses with the Shear Stress Transport (SST) k-Ï‰ turbulence model were performed to investigate the ship's propulsive performance and power savings at full load and sea trial conditions with both conventional and gate rudder arrangements. For multi-phase flows, the volume of fluid method (VOF) was used to account for free surface effects, and the model was unconstrained by heave and pitch. Grid convergence, verification, and validation studies were carried out to ensure the accuracy of the numerical studies. Improved propulsive performance and more than 12% power savings for the ship with the gate rudder system have been achieved at both loading conditions compared to the conventional rudder for the selected cargo ship. The study also observes scale effects, which reveal that the gate rudder of the larger model generates more thrust compared to the smaller one. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

In this work, two case vessels were considered for analysis, a Roll-On-Roll-Off ship and a harbour tug boat. Actual sailing operational profiles were used as the basis for energy considerations to assess the potential for lower emissions. An energy-centric simulation model was built to estimate the emission of various pollutants, considering different machinery set-ups. Results have shown that savings are possible, especially for vessels which run on residual fuels, where auxiliary drives provide a way of exploiting the advantages of cleaner sources for manoeuvring instances.

AB  - This paper defines a risk analysis framework for offshore wind turbines (OWTs) and OWT farms. OWTs, due to their exposure to a demanding climatic environment, the use of particularly innovative construction methods and materials, and the relatively limited knowhow in the design and construction, are prone to elevated risk. The risk analysis problem is defined within a more global risk management framework, where several steps are foreseen in order to accomplish predetermined objectives. Starting from the establishment of the specific risk management context, the various steps for risk assessment are presented, together with the methods for risk identification, analysis, evaluation and mitigation, strictly related with the complexity of the system. As a final step, the options for risk treatment are considered. In addition, for the purpose of risk identification, a system decomposition of the relevant elements is performed, both physical related (e.g. the constituting parts) and for the external conditions and interactions.

AB  - This work considers the possibility of using the absolute depressions Bajo del Gualicho (- 72 m) and Bajo de San JuliÃ¡n (-107m), RÃ­o Negro and Santa Cruz Provinces respectively, for tidal electrical generation by means of a connection with the Atlantic Sea in Argentinean Patagonia Region [1]. This would allow the formation of large lakes that would create an Â«artificial albÃºferaÂ» which will cover an area of about 1234 km2 in Gualicho and 650km2 in San JuliÃ¡n. These lakes will be exposed to tidal by means of an array with combination of a channels and four tunnels/chan. Gualicho and Only Tunnels in San JuliÃ¡n, which will be located between the sea and the lake. Taking the reference of Puerto San Antonio Este for Gualicho, the average tidal range reaches 6.73m [2], lasting 6 hs. 20 min.. In the case of San JuliÃ¡n, the tidal reaches 7,45m and lasting 6hours and 45minutes.

VL  - 9
IS  - NA
AB  - Despite the potential for carbon storage in tidal flats, little is known about the details of relevant processes because of the complexity of intertidal physical and chemical environments and the uniqueness of the biota. We measured air-water carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and water-sediment oxygen (O-2) fluxes over a tidal flat in Tokyo Bay by the eddy covariance method, which has the potential to facilitate long-term, broad-scale, continuous monitoring of carbon flows in tidal flats. The results indicated that throughout the tidal flat in Tokyo Bay, CO2 was taken up from the atmosphere at a rate of 6.05 +/- 7.14 (mean +/- SD) mmol m(-2) hour(-1), and O-2 was taken up from the water into the sediment at a rate of 0.62 +/- 1.14 (mean +/- SD) mmol m(-2) hour(-1). The fact that the CO2 uptake rate was about 18 times faster than the previously reported average uptake rate in the whole area of Tokyo Bay was attributable to physical turbulence in the water column caused by bottom friction. Statistical analysis suggested that light intensity and water temperature were the major factors responsible for variations of CO2 and O-2 exchange, respectively. Other factors such as freshwater inputs, atmospheric stability, and wind speed also affected CO2 and O-2 exchange. High rates of O-2 uptake from the water into the sediment surface and high rates of atmospheric CO2 uptake into the water column occurred simultaneously (R-2 = 0.44 and 0.47 during day and night, respectively). The explanation could be that photosynthetic consumption of CO2 and production of O-2 in the water column increased the downward CO2 (air to water) and O-2 (water to sediment) fluxes by increasing the concentration gradients of those gases. Resuspension of sediment in the low-O-2 layer by physical disturbance would also increase the O-2 concentration gradient and the O-2 flux in the water.

AB  - International transport, which includes ocean shipping and aviation, is among the fastest-growing sources of human-generated greenhouse gas emissions. Given the nature of global transport, it is difficult to allocate its environmental impacts to any one country. In 2011, the IMO defined an efficiency standard for new ships. It came into effect in 2013 and will be progressively tightened. For existing ships, the IMO published guidelines for voluntary energy management plans. It forecasts that this combination of measures is likely to reduce emissions from shipping by 180 million ton by 2020, or by 9 to 16% relative to business as usual. As a first step in implementing the proposed market-based mechanisms for both industries, accurate data on fuel burn will need to be collected. Because the cost of making large cuts in emissions within international transport is probably prohibitive, it is economically efficient for the industry to pay for cuts to be made in other sectors, where they are cheaper to make.

AB  - With stringent environmental regulations and growing concerns on energy consumption of the marine transport sector, there is a serious effort to make on board energy system more efficient. Improving fuel efficiency is conceived as a sustainable measure in terms of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and overall marine energy use. As such, electrification of ship propulsion has been introduced as a solution for operating at higher efficiency and hence more saving fuel. However, energy efficiency in the context of marine transport is to be more stringent over time as required by International Maritime Organization (IMO). The energy performance indicators to evaluate such requirements include Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI). Several energy efficient methods are therefore proposed to further improve fuel efficiency on board electric vessels. These involve integration of energy storage system, implementation of DC distribution, optimal power distribution and scheduling as well as various operational practices that are currently applicable for existing conventional vessels. The paper summaries the concept of ship energy efficiency in terms of the standard indicators and provide a brief review on the energy efficiency improvement strategies published in literature. The aim of the review is to analyze the methods that are potential to incorporate into the autonomous system of all-electric vessels. The results show a significant variation in reported efficiency gain and thus a combination of various methods is suggested to achieve full potential for emissions reduction.

AB  - Currently, most ships use internal combustion engines (ICEs) either as propulsion engines or generator sets. The growing concern in environmental protection along with the consequent international rule framework motivated shipowners and designers to replace conventional power systems in order to mitigate pollutant emissions. Therefore, manufacturers have made available on the market many technological solutions to use alternative fuels (Liquefied Natural Gas or LNG, methanol, etc.). However, the main energy source is still fossil fuel, so almost all the ICEs are made up of turbocharged diesel engines (TDEs). TDEs have still the potential to improve their efficiency and reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. In particular, the interpretation of Industry 4.0 given by manufacturers enabled the installation of a robust network of sensors on TDEs, which is able to allow reliable power management systems and make ships much more efficient regarding operating costs (fuel consumption and maintenance) and environmental footprint. In this paper, a software tool that is capable of processing the in-live performance of TDEs is described. The great novelty consists in the ability to process all the information detected by the sensor network in-live and dynamically optimize TDEs' operation, whereas the common practice involves the collection of performance data and their off-line processing.

AB  - The World Heritage microbialites, coquinas, and microbialitic-sediments of Hamelin Pool, Shark Bay, Western Australia, form through complex community and environmental interactions resulting in surficial CO2 sequestration. Predicted climate-change impacts threaten the stability of this setting and the balance of biogeomorphological processes that generate them. In this setting, long-term surficial CO2 sequestration occurs through the combination of biomineralisation, organomineralisation and lithification, which locks atmospheric CO2 into CaCO3 rocks and sediments. Biogeomorphological processes that control the distribution and effectiveness of these mechanisms including biostabilisation, bioconstruction, bioerosion and bioturbation have not been addressed in this setting to date. A three-dimensional biogemorphological mapping unit framework is defined at three locations in Hamelin Pool within the shallow-subtidal to supratidal zones based on historical and recent multiscale datasets. This framework is used to review the complex distribution of geomorphological and biogeomorphological processes. The distribution of lithification within a biogeomorphological process context is examined, and current geological analogue models of microbialite and coquina development are expanded to include biogeomorphological processes. The framework is used to understand the impacts of increased water elevation in response to intensification of the Leeuwin Current during the 2010-2012 Ningaloo Nino event. Potential climate change impacts are identified including reduced intertidal bioconstruction, and a shift from microbialitic structure generation to increased grain generation reducing stromatolite development. Review of the uncertainty of impacts of ocean acidification and temperature shifts on biomineralisation, organomineralisation and lithification processes, crucial to the maintenance of the outstanding universal values in this World Heritage location, suggests urgent research is required.

VL  - 22

AB  - Energy from tidal streams is a reliable renewable energy source worth exploiting. With increasing concern over the potential effects of ocean energy utilization on marine environment and organisms, several previous experimental studies have been conducted focusing on fish behavior and their collision risk with hydrokinetic turbines for power generation. This study is aimed at exploring the behavior of marine animals around marine current turbines (MCTs) in the sea environment by conducting a laboratory experiment based on similarity laws for the turbine tip speed and maximum marine animal swimming speed. Three rotation frequencies (0, 5 and 20 rpm) with two releasing areas (upstream and downstream areas) were considered in our experiment. Results showed that fish survival rate was 100 \% after 48 h, and only one fish came into contact with the turbine hub and was inactive in front of it when the MCT was in a stationary state during our preliminary test of swimming endurance. Although both the initial releasing area of fish and the rotation speed of MCT have significant effects on fish passage count rate (PCR) via a turbine, there is no interaction between these two factors. PCR was generally higher when fish were put into the tank in the downstream area, irrespective of the turbine rotation. And the returning behavior in the downstream area was more frequently found compared with that in the upstream area, which indicates that the location of MCTs should be considered at the downstream of a channel in practice to reduce the potential risk of fish injury. The ratio of fish passing from the outer side (+/- 3) of the turbine was larger, and a clear U-shaped distribution could be observed. The entering behavior almost disappeared (less than 1.3 \%) when MCT rotated with a frequency of 20 rpm. It indicates the design of the rotation frequency of MCT should be more than 20 rpm. However, higher tip speeds and darkness conditions are not considered in our experiment. Based on the laws of similarity proposed in this study, it becomes possible to compare the experimental results with real sea results, to allow explanation and discussion of fish behavior around MCTs, through the parameters of flow velocity, turbine tip speed, and maximum fish swimming speed.

AB  - Tidal energy to obtain electrical energy is yet an unexploited renewable energy. Existing generator designs and prototypes are not feasible due to the high investment conditioned by their high rated powers and off-shore locations. In addition, these prototypes are not readily available. This investigation presents a design of a microgeneration system with vertical axis microturbines. The design of the microturbines utilizes off-the-shelf electronic components, thus reducing the initial investment. The nominal data for selection of power electronic components and the total energy that can be obtained in a year are calculated. The investigation also studies the feasibility of an 80 kW microgeneration system to be applied in Spain, taking advantage of the actual electricity prices. The feasibility study quantifies the influence of the parameters: initial investment, tidal current speed, operation hours, turbine efficiency, price of electricity, and number of microturbines obtaining the limiting values of the suitable scenarios.

AB  - Application of power factor correction techniques to energy savings in practical ship electric power systems have been studied. From an economic viewpoint, the energy-saving benefits due to introduction of the power factor correction option and investment costs required should be considered in planning of the investment for judging whether the improvement option is economic or not. This paper aims to establish a set of benefit-cost analysis model for power factor correction utilized in ships. The active power, reactive power, power factor, and diesel electric engine's oil consumption for a practical merchant vessel power system during different operating conditions are measured and analyzed. The possible benefits for energy-saving and emission reduction after installing automatic power factor corrector (APFC) devices are identified and a benefit-cost analysis of APFC for a practical bulk carrier is performed by using two standard economic analysis methods. Sensitivity of basic economic parameters to analysis results is also performed to reduce effects of input parameters on the analysis results and to determine the critical parameters. The proposed analysis model developed in this paper can assist ship building corporations and ship owners in assessing performance of the power factor improvement option and building business cases for determining return on investment (ROI).

AB  - Offshore wind energy (OSWE) is often considered as more than simply a way to reduce carbon footprint. It is also viewed by many coastal municipalities as a source of new jobs and economic growth. This paper explains the reality of these expectations and presents five critical design considerations that must be applied in the development of a successful U.S. wind turbine logistics port. These design considerations have been developed through years of planning, analysis and design of offshore wind turbine facilities, general cargo terminals, and offshore oil and natural gas structures. To achieve the economies required by the U.S. market, innovative terminal handling methods and vessel loading technologies must be implemented. These technologies have already been applied in Europe and are doing much to drive down the levelized cost of offshore wind energy. Â© ASCE.

TI  - Numerical analysis of economic and environmental benefits of marine fuel conversion from diesel oil to natural gas for container ships
JO  - Environmental Science And Pollution Research
PY  - 2021
VL  - 28

AB  - Shipping is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions. These emissions mainly come from using diesel fuel for power generation. In this paper, the natural gas is proposed as an alternative marine fuel to be used instead of conventional marine diesel oil. Numerical analysis of environmental and economic benefits of the natural gas-diesel dual-fuel engine is carried out. As a case study, a container ship of class A7 owned by Hapag-Lloyd has been investigated. The results show that the proposed dual-fuel engine achieves environmental benefits for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), particulate matter (PM), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions by 20.1%, 85.5%, 98%, 99%, and 55.7% with cost effectiveness of 109, 840, 9864, 27761, and 4307Â US$/ton, respectively. The results show that the conversion process to the dual-fuel engine will comply with the current and future IMO regulations regarding air pollutant emissions. On the other hand, using the proposed dual-fuel engine on the container ship will improve the ship energy efficiency index by 29.6 % with annual fuel cost saving of 4.77 million US dollars.

TI  - A new strategic approach of energy management onboard ships supported by exergy and economic criteria: A case study of a cargo ship
JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2021
VL  - 219
IS  - NA
AB  - The fossil-source energy consumption in maritime transportation is an important input which affects the operating costs. In this market, cargo ships with potentially represents up to 78% of the total global maritime transportation are considered as vessels with a high fossil fuel consumption. These ships need effective energy management to reduce environmental pollution from fossil fuel and to manage sustainable energy-related costs in commerce. In this study, an energy efficiency strategy framework was developed primarily to support efficient energy management as the decision support element in ships. Considering the ship's cruising processes, energy efficiency and economic effectiveness were examined as based on the exergy approach and the economic criteria. In this context, two new criteria were developed: the â€œEnvironmental Cost Index (ECI)" and the â€œEnergy Efficiency Index (EEI)". According to the analyzes results, the energy and exergy efficiencies in the sample ship's cruising processes were found as 38.33% and 35.82% respectively, and the calculated ECI was 0.41. These reference values showed that the fuel-related loss cost of the ship was 19.05%. At the end of the study, some evaluations were made on the implementation of the energy efficiency strategy and its effects. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Considering the upgoing price of fossil fuel and requirements are becoming more and more stringent regarding pollutant emissions, the need of replacing the fossil fuel with a cheaper and less pollutant one emerges. The TECS software deal with thermal engine calculation problematics in order to determine, for different fuels types (liquid or gaseous), the indicated and effective engine parameters and also for verification, analysis and calculation of thermo-dynamic processes. As a result, the maritime industry is investigating alternative fuels for shipping. Methanol is an attractive alternative because it reduces polluting emissions and is expected to be cheaper in the future. This paper analyses the maritime engine performance when using fossil fuels as well as methanol. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization, the European Union Council and the US government force ship owners to take necessary measures through international conventions and national legislation to minimize ship-based emissions which damage to the environment and has reached a serious level. Thus, ship operators began to turn towards alternative technologies and fuels that reduce emissions to ensure the maritime trade smoothly. On the other hand, some port operators has started to supply alternative maritime power (AMP) which is electricity from city grid line to the ships at the berth. It is a fact that AMP is one of the best emission reduction alternative technologies for ships during berthing period. This kind of ports providing AMP will be compulsory choice for many ship operators who still use fossil fuel-powered engines in their ships and cannot meet the emission limit requirements at ports, also these ports will contribute to the environmental protection. In this study, AMP application will be examined for the Ege Ports in Kusadast. Purpose of the study is to calculate the amount of emissions and external costs and to compare with marine gas oil (MGO) when the AMP system is applied to a port. According to comparison of AMP technology with MGO (0.1\%S); total air pollutant is reduced by 94\% via decreasing SO2 23\%, NOx 97\%, PM 88\%, CO 99\%, VOC 64\%. On the other hand, it is estimated that total released greenhouse gases are minimized by 41\% via decreasing CO2 41\%, N2O 85\% and CH4 81\%. Finally, total emission reduction was about 43\%. The economic and environmental benefits to the port hinterland and its country has been estimated by finding external cost. Total externality cost of MGO for human health, ecosystem quality and climate change was found as about Euro 3 million while Euro 0,4 million occured from AMP.

TI  - How Does the Accessibility of Floating Wind Farm Sites Compare to Existing Fixed Bottom Sites?
JO  - Energies
PY  - 2022
VL  - 15
IS  - 23
AB  - Offshore wind is poised for huge growth in the coming years, the UK government has set targets of 40 GW of offshore wind, including 1 GW of floating wind, to be installed in the UK by 2030. Many proposed wind development sites are in deeper waters, farther from shore and will therefore need to be developed as floating wind sites. Developing sites in deeper waters provides access to higher, more consistent wind speeds, however this also means increased wave heights and tougher operating conditions. This makes the challenge of site accessibility critical to the goal of lowering the costs of offshore wind. Accessibility is the amount of time that vessels can safely access a given site. The objective of this study was to make a comparison of the accessibility of potential future floating wind sites to existing fixed bottom wind farm sites. Accessibility was calculated by developing Matlab code using established techniques and definitions found in the literature. A case study was then completed using sites in Scottish waters proposed for development as part of the Scotwind leasing plan. The majority of the Scotwind sites will need to be developed as floating wind sites due to the large water depths. This study assesses the accessibility of the Scotwind leasing sites and compares them to a typical fixed bottom site. The study found that accessibility will be a greater challenge for floating farm wind sites compared to fixed bottom sites. Increased access to vessels that can operate in larger wave heights will likely be necessary to operate and maintain floating wind farm sites. Â© 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The worldwide effort on the environmental issue in the maritime field has led to always more stringent regulations on greenhouse gas emission (GHG). In this perspective, the International Maritime Organization has developed regulations intended to increase the ship's efficiency and reduce GHG emissions both in design phase, through the introduction of an Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), either in management phase, adopting the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP). In this challenging perspective, several approaches and technologies adopted in land-based engineering can also be advantageous for marine applications. This is the case of the Distributed Energy Resources (DER) solution applied in landbased microgrids, which increases both the system's efficiency and reliability. This work is primarily focused on methodological aspects related to the adoption of a DER solution on-board cruise ships, with the integration of different energy sources in order to pursue a more flexible, reliable and sustainable management of the ship. In this context, another engineering best practice developed for land-based applications that is further investigated in the paper is related to the on board thermal energy recovery issue, revisited due to the implementation of the DER solution.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 18
IS  - 13
AB  - Mangrove forests are extremely productive ecosystems, are sources and sinks of organic carbon, and provide essential services both to the marine environment and people. We have studied the composition and species richness of modern benthic foraminiferal assemblages from mangrove swamps along the Mamanguape River in ParaÃ­ba, northern Brazil. Sampling points for foraminifera were selected to acquire information on the composition of foraminiferal assemblages from dense mangrove stands collected along a river transect. Almost 100 species of benthic foraminifera were identified within the shallow mangrove habitats. The large number of identified mangrove taxa is the highest recorded so far for true mangrove habitats. The high species richness rivals shallow-water assemblages recorded from nearby offshore and reef environments and indicates that a particularly large number of species is capable of growing and flourishing under multiple stressor conditions. Numerical analysis of the faunal assemblages shows that specific taxa, which were previously known to be uncommon in mangrove environments, are abundant in the Mamanguape River estuary. The atypical foraminiferal fauna found in the Mamanguape River estuary resembles shallow-water offshore assemblages, is characterized by high percent abundances of perforate and miliolid taxa, and contains only very few of the otherwise typical and numerically abundant agglutinated mangrove taxa. The unusual structure of the assemblages recorded provides insight into what combination of environmental variables controls their composition and novel perspectives to reconstruct past mangrove environments. Distribution, diversity, and species-specific analysis will provide guidance on the use of Brazilian mangrove foraminifera as indicators for the strength of tidal activity, pollution, and anoxia in coastal waters and sea-level reconstructions.

AB  - With the aim to reduce emissions from marine transport, electric propulsion systems for a water taxi and container ship powered by a hydrogen polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell system are designed and analyzed compared to the current fuel-oil engine systems in terms of system energy and exergy efficiency, fuel consumption, mass and volume, environmental impacts and cost. Hydrogen is stored either as a compressed gas (GH2), cryogenic liquid (LH2) or produced from liquid ammonia (LNH3) and can deliver 91%,91% and 88% greenhouse gas reductions, respectively. All hydrogen sources fit within ship volume and mass constraints apart from GH2 in the cargo ship. In the absence of carbon policy measures, the costs over a 25-year system life are 108% (GH2), 112% (LH2), 116% (LNH3) greater for the container ship and 43% (GH2), 105% (LNH3) greater for the water taxi.

AB  - Increasingly stringent regulations on emission control and energy efficiency operations drives the maritime industry towards hybrid solutions incorporating energy storage and other alternative energy sources into marine power systems. In particular, commercial all-electric hybrid vessels with dynamic operations such as harbor tugs often face significant challenges in power management control to maximize fuel savings, in addition to ensuring power system reliability. An intelligent power management control strategy plays an important role in effectively managing the multiple energy sources and their constraints to achieve desired control objectives. Hence, in this paper, Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is proposed to address these challenges. The propose strategy shows comparative performance in terms of fuel savings when compared to the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS), with added advantage of improving power system reliability.

AB  - Increasing size of wind turbine and deep water deployment have raised the issue of appropriate selection of the most suitable support structure to make offshore wind energy cost competitive. The paper presents an optimization methodology for decision making process of bottom mounted supports of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) through reasonable engineering attributes derivation. Mathematic models of support structures are reduced by the generalized single-degree-of-freedom theory with relatively fewer structural parameters. Soft-stiff design optimization based on dynamic properties of OWTs is performed for monopile and lattice supports with different wind turbines, water depth and hub height. Attributes of support structures, wind turbines and environment conditions are applied in the multi-criteria decision making method-TOPSIS for benchmarking of those options. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimazation methodology combined with economical and environmental attributes together.

AB  - This paper analyzes the energy replacement potential for high-speed passenger vessels. Emphasis is on whether better planning of services can mitigate technical and economic barriers to zero emission transport. A novel Mixed-Integer Programming problem for battery electric vessel services that jointly minimizes operator and passenger costs subject to strategic (fleet selection and land-based infrastructure location), tactical (frequency), and operational decisions (sailing pattern) is proposed. The planning problem is utilized to estimate technology replacement potential and associated costs for two existing services/routes in Norway and based on four hypothetical demand scenarios derived from the same two services. The results showcase that constraints related to battery range and charging limit the replacement potential and make energy conservation more pertinent. Abatement cost estimates range between 3 000 and 18 000 NOK per ton CO2, placing them well above the social cost of carbon calculated at 2 000 NOK per ton by 2030.

JO  - Journal Of Cleaner Production

VL  - 271
IS  - NA
AB  - The pollutant emissions from ships in harbor are a pressing concern due to their direct impact on the health of the population. The use of electric-battery propulsion is a viable solution to reduce the emissions in coastal areas, but it is only applicable to small ferries. Large cruise ships commonly utilize shore power connection to provide onboard electricity, avoiding pollution during harbor stays. However, this solution is not applicable during short stays. This paper presents a novel and energy-efficient way to supply zero-emission power during harbor stays of marine vessels. The proposed system combines the use of a thermal energy storage and a waste heat recovery system based on the organic Rankine cycle technology. The objective of this work is to investigate the technical feasibility of the proposed system and to compare its cost-effectiveness with the alternative solution of using batteries during harbor stays. The study is based on a case study of a hypothetical ferry requiring 1 MW of auxiliary power during harbor stays. The results suggest that the proposed system would require the installation of a storage tank of around 82 m3, and that it could be economically competitive with the battery-based solution, especially when considering its installation on newly built ships. Lastly, it is estimated that the installation of the proposed concept would lead to reduction of the ferry's carbon dioxide emissions by 8%. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Concerns about the impact of global warming caused by air pollution and depletion of fossil fuels have attracted attention and opportunities in transportation especially in maritime industry. In all electric ships, the electrical equipment including electric propulsion is connected to the common ship electrical network to achieve better fuel consumption with less emission. However, the low-load factor of the parallel diesel generators (DGs) in some operating conditions, can negatively affect the fuel consumption rate. As an alternative, two or more power sources such as batteries and renewable-based prime movers can be integrated into the system aboard to improve the overall system performance. By optimal scheduling of the power sources, poor low-load efficiency can be avoided and controllable units can be dispatched in an emission-aware and cost-effective manner. This paper analyzes how much the operating cost of a shipboard system can be improved (based on estimation of specific fuel consumption (SFC) curve of a real system) considering the dynamic load profile with and without energy storage systems (ESSs). The case study in this paper is a ferry with a conversion from traditional diesel mechanical power to electrical propulsion powered by DGs and ESSs. Â© 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Carbon capturing and sequestration are of great interest to reduce the carbon dioxide CO2 emissions from the atmosphere. To achieve this, forests, grasslands, and vegetation areas, in general, should be planted and conserved. However, for cultivating a landscape, water resources become an issue for some regions specifically in the arid areas where they have water scarcity and use desalination of seawater for life amenities. Even with using relatively clean energy source (natural gas), desalination is responsible for 12 kg of CO2 eq m-3 with high consumption of electricity and energy resources. Alternating this with treated wastewater with good purity can help reuse of treated sewage effluent TSE, abate the consumption of resources, and mitigate the emissions of CO2. This scenario was applied in the middle east region, particularly in Qatar where the 2022 World Cup event will be held. An intensive project was established near Doha north TSE with the potential of reducing the massive amount of CO2 by natural sequestration through planting trees and grasslands. Efficiently, TSE exclusively was used to cover the need of the whole landscape. In this study, the focus was on studying the potential mitigation of carbon by measuring the operational carbon footprint from facilitating and planting the landscape, the carbon captured by the whole landscape (trees, grassland, soil, etc.), and the net carbon storage and neutralization. Initial results showed that the usage of TSE was able to reduce the CO2 by approximately 12 times compared to desalinated water. With further investigation, the value of carbon sequestration through the landscape can provide positive net carbon storage helping in neutralizing carbon emissions with sustainable and natural facilities.

AB  - The balance of marine autotrophy and heterotrophy regulates the ocean's ability to serve as a CO2 sink, as organic material produced by autotrophs sinks into the ocean interior to drive the biological pump. Marine ecosystems over the continental margins, especially coastal upwelling regions, account for a disproportionate amount of carbon export; thus, even small fluctuations in export in these regions can have a large impact on the global carbon cycle. In this study, we estimated the rate of gross oxygen production (GOP), stoichiometrically related to gross primary production, by combining measurements of the triple isotope composition of dissolved oxygen with estimates of vertical advection, eddy diffusion, and air-sea gas exchange in a one-dimensional two-box nonsteady state model of the euphotic zone. Net oxygen production (NOP) estimates based on O-2/Ar were then combined with GOP to estimate the NOP/GOP ratio, or potential export efficiency, out of the euphotic zone at the San Pedro Ocean Time-series during an 18 month period between January 2013 and June 2014. GOP estimates ranged from 161 +/- 44 to 477 +/- 155 mmol m(-2) d(-1) during this period, peaking in May each year, and NOP/GOP ratios ranged from 0.05 +/- 0.10 to 0.65 +/- 0.28. The highest export efficiency occurred in late February/early March, following the onset of spring upwelling, declining as the upwelling season continued. This study demonstrates that export efficiency changes through time in this temperate coastal upwelling region on a repeated annual cycle, and the magnitude of export efficiency suggests efficient photosynthetic energy conversion by phytoplankton in spring.

The Mutriku wave farm's annual output in the period analysed has been 246,468.7 kW-h, with an average of around ten working turbines. The results indicate that Mutriku's average capacity factor is around 0.11, with higher values in winter than in summer. These values are below the capacity factors reported for other renewable energy sources. The plant efficiency index is 0.26, and further advances in regulation and control may also raise this parameter's values, as may lower rated power alternators. This will also help to improve the Mutriku wave plant's capacity factor, and OWC technology in general.

AB  - Ecospec's (Singapore) CSNOx exhaust gas after-treatment system is claimed to remove CO2 from exhaust gases as well as SO2 and NOx. The system operates by taking seawater and increasing its pH level from 9.5 to 10 through an ultra low frequency process. SO2 gas is readily converted to acid in the seawater, while a further process oxidizes the NO to convert it to NO2, which is also acidified by the treated seawater. In the next process, the acids are neutralized, resulting in clean water and various carbonates and bicarbonates which are naturally present in seawater. Separated solids can be stored, or sent as sludge to the bilge tank for further treatment.

AB  - Pakistan has been facing the problem of energy shortages and the problem has deteriorated under successive governments. A burning need of the hour is to devise proper strategy for utilizing the available resources and making Pakistan self-sufficient in energy requirements. Different segments of the society have discussed on the feasible issues and convergence of ideas to work on a joint mechanism with active involvement and support from the government along with guidance from scientists and academia is the way forward to derive a long term sustainable solution. Alternate energy resources have to be introduced at domestic and commercial level thus promoting viable energy efficient solution across the country. Roughly the requirement is around 6000 MW which has to be added to the national grid. With the blatant needs of energy, Pakistan has the right to exercise the use of nuclear energy for meeting its demands and keeping the civil nuclear agreements going on in the world. Many energy sources are environmental friendly, they provide an alternate safe source helping to keep pollution within certain levels as required by the world standards. Coastal areas of Pakistan are a huge resource for utilizing wind energy potential to its maximal level. Pakistan has the potential to generate 3 million megawatts electricity through solar energy. The need of the hour is to build small scale hydro dams in Pakistan since other power generation sources are difficult to be implemented in remote areas. We would explore the available resources for maximal benefit and utilization. Â© IDOSI Publications, 2014.

JO  - Brodogradnja

IS  - 4
AB  - The low-speed marine diesel engine is the most effective of all the ship propulsion systems. On every ship there is a need for thermal energy besides mechanical power to drive the propeller. It is possible to install a heat exchanger in the exhaust system that makes use of waste heat of the exhaust gasses of the diesel engine. Such a combined mechanical and thermal energy generation is called cogeneration. Modern engines allow the variation of the fuel injection timing and the variation of the exhaust valve timing, which results in a great usage flexibility. In the current work a computer simulation model of a low-speed marine diesel engine is presented. The exhaust gas heat energy available to power a heat exchanger was calculated. The time of the beginning of fuel injection and the time of the opening of the exhaust valve was varied. It was analyzed how these parameters influence the power, the fuel consumption, the engine efficiency, the exhaust gas temperature, the heat energy available in the exhaust gasses, the overall efficiency of the cogeneration system, and the power to heat ratio.

JO  - Energies
PY  - 2019
VL  - 14
IS  - 15
AB  - Japan is a nation which is highly dependent on the import of raw materials to supply its manufacturing industry, notable among them copper. When extracting copper from ore, a large amount of energy is required, typically leading to high levels of CO2 emissions due to the fossil fuel-dominated energy mix. Moreover, maintaining security of raw material supply is difficult if imports are the only source utilized. This study examines the environmental and economic impacts of domestic mineral production from the recycling of end-of-life products and deep ocean mining as strategies to reduce CO2 emissions and enhance security of raw material supplies. The results indicate that under the given assumptions, recycling, which is typically considered to be less CO2 intensive, produces higher domestic emissions than current copper processing, although across the whole supply chain shows promise. As the total quantity of domestic resources from deep ocean ores are much smaller than the potential from recycling, it is possible that recycling could become a mainstream supply alternative, while deep ocean mining is more likely to be a niche supply source. Implications of a progressively aging society and flow-on impacts for the recycling sector are discussed. Â© 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Environmental technological innovations driven by the evolving regulatory landscape have the potential to provide performance solutions for the next generation of offshore vessels. Future historians may look back at the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, Annex VI (MARPOL) requirements as one of the most important pieces of maritime legislation passed. It sets in motion a series of requirements that change the way vessels are designed and operated. For all practical purposes, the offshore industry may be revolutionized by the confluence of Annex VI requirements which limit the amount of sulfur in fuel oil, limit the amount of nitrogen oxides emitted from the engine combustion process, and reduce CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. The economics of alternative fuels such as LNG and the imperatives of operating in Emission Control Areas (ECA) are driving innovative vessel designs. Offshore vessel operators of the world can greatly benefit by adopting green technologies such as renewable energy, alternative fuels, hybrid propulsion and power generation plants, and advanced environmental systems. This paper will outline a number of emission pollutant driven and energy efficiency driven green ship technologies currently being adopted in offshore vessel design, and considers the opportunities this presents for future designs.

AB  - Planktos, an organization that spreads iron dust over great swaths of the ocean and as a sideline, grows forests to be sold as carbon offsets to those wishing to counterbalance their greenhouse gas emissions. The idea behind the iron dust scheme is that, the element is an important ingredient that determines how much phytoplankton can grow on some regions of the ocean's surface. As it grows, they pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into organic carbon. Carbon extracted from the atmosphere through iron fertilization holds the promise of solving the problem of climate change. By design, iron fertilization would modify the biological processes at work in the ocean. However, top on the list of side effect is the possibility that an increase in carbon sequestration might cause other parts of the ocean to release more nitrous oxide. Still, the firm contends that the amount of plankton has lessened and that the offsets they use will restore it.

AB  - Maritime emission regulations set limits for SOx and NOx emissions for health and environmental reasons, and for CO2 through the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), with the general aim of mitigating global warming. EEDI verification is performed at the vessel's design speed and design loads, under calm-water conditions. This, although calm seas are the exception in shipping, and that even with calm-water conditions, ships usually operate at lower speeds than their design speed. A major challenge, if greenhouse gases (GHG) reduction targets are to be met through the EEDI, will be to identify EEDI-compliant solutions that reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions under realistic operational conditions, from lying idle at berth in port to when full power is required in critical situations at sea. In view of all the above, we use the Aframax tanker class to illustrate how such an assessment can be performed, and to display the differences in costs and benefits of options, all of which meet the requirements of the EEDI.

TI  - FUEL CELLS IN DEEP-SEA SHIPPING: CHALLENGING PATH AHEAD
JO  - Motor Ship
PY  - 2020
VL  - 101
IS  - 1179
AB  - As regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions take effect step by step, the introduction of fuel cells to vessels is inevitable. In response to this, Samsung Heavy Industries' (SHI) Outfitting Team is working with New York-listed Bloom Energy to develop an Aframax tanker design powered by fuel cells running on natural gas. Fuel cells are capable of providing a zero-emission source of energy for deep-sea ships. However, until such marine fuel cell installations are optimized, power density, and therefore real estate required on board, will be a challenge compared to internal combustion engines. Two types are considered potentially most suitable for marine applications. First, low temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells provide high power density comparable with internal combustion engines. Solid oxide fuel cells, meanwhile, operate at high temperatures, creating opportunities for waste heat recovery, as well as the potential for more durable generators, greater fuel flexibility, and very high combined cycle efficiencies. The adoption of fuel cells will increase, initially for distributed power, then for integration with larger systems to meet continuous power demands, and ultimately for propulsion. Following the 2018 closure of the 15-yr FellowShip project exploring the use of batteries, hybrids, and fuel cell technologies with pilot installations on board the offshore supply vessel, Viking Lady, WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ is working again with Norway's Eidesvik Offshore, state oil company Equinor and classification society DNV GL to test fuel cells on board Eidesvik's supply vessel, Viking Energy. The LNG-powered vessel is to be modified to enable it to cover large distances fueled by carbon-free ammonia fuel cells.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has enforced stricter limit on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission due to environment and climate concern. The measures to reduce GHG emissions from shipping can be divided into two groups. The first one is to improve ship energy efficiency through new technology, optimized operation and logistics, and the second one is to introduce alternative fuels with lower carbon intensity. However, the effectiveness and applicability of any measure depend on ship type, ship size, operation type, operation environment (wind and wave condition), as well as the cost of the measure. It is necessary to evaluate new measures in real shipping scenario. Modeling of ship fuel consumption and emission are fundamental input to evaluate the impacts of shipping on the environment and climate, and to evaluate new measures for reducing GHG emission. A modeling system is developed to estimate ship fuel consumption and emission, based on ship hydrodynamical models, information from Automatic Identification System (AIS), the IHS Fairplay database and metocean data. The modeling system aims to cover most of the ship types equipped with AIS transponders, and it will provide different hydrodynamical models to calculate fuel consumption based on the available ship information. In the paper, the modeling system will be described, and the power consumption from the modeling system are compared with the measurement data on one container ship. The comparison shows that the power consumption predicted with the modeling system agrees with measurement data well. The effects of weather data and measured speed on predicted power consumption are also analyzed. Â© 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). All rights reserved.

JO  - Desalination
PY  - 1996
VL  - 106
IS  - 1-3
AB  - Although India receives an average rainfall of 100 cm, some parts of the country get only scanty rains and are subject to chronic water shortages. Due to the occasional failure of the monsoons, a drinking water problem in these areas becomes quite acute. Water has to be brought in tankers and railway wagons to meet the drinking water needs of the people. With the advent of desalination technology based on both thermal and membrane processes, it is being considered as an alternate source to provide/augment the drinking water sources in the coastal water scarce areas. R &amp; D work carried out at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) on desalination in the last 10â€“15 y has resulted in the development of technology for brackish water and seawater desalination in the country. Operation of pilot plants based on both membrane and thermal desalination has provided useful data for the design of large-scale desalination plants. This paper gives the details of a 1.4 mgd (6300 m3/d) desalination plant to be installed in a coastal area for augmenting the drinking water supply. This consists of a 1.0 mgd multi-stage flash (MSF) and a 0.4 mgd two-stage reverse osmosis (RO) plant based on an indigenously available cellulosic membrane. A two-stage RO process is required in view of moderate salt rejection of cellulose acetate membranes for seawater feed. These membranes, however, possess better chlorine tolerance and fouling resistance compared to TFC membranes. As such this system is more appropriate under Indian conditions. The steam for the MSF plant will be available from a thermal power station where the plant is to be set up. Part of the product water obtained from the MSF plant will be used for entire boiler feed make up of the power station (in lieu of obtaining steam and power for the desalination plant). The remaining product water from the MSF plant (around 0.6 mgd) and RO plant (0.4 mgd) will be blended to get potable water of 250 ppm TDS. The MSF and RO plants are based on indigenous technology using most of the materials and equipment made locally. The detail design aspects and the cost estimates are presented in the paper.

AB  - The Commonwealth of Dominica, amongst the least populated islands in the Caribbean (70,000 pop.), identified the potential to upgrade and expand its hydropower generating capacity from various sites in the country. One site is located in Newtown, outside of Roseau (Dominicaâ€™s capital city). It offers the possibility of increasing its share of clean energy in the countryâ€™s electricity mix through small-scale hydro developments. Dominica has also considered the development of additional hydropower resources within the Roseau valley, a protected area, though it requires addressing ecosystem-based climate resilience concerns in an integrated manner. This may pose a sustainable energy challenge in the short term; in the long run, Dominica plans to become carbon negative through the addition of geothermal energy to its electricity mix. The Governmentâ€™s commitment to these plans has been internationally declared, as part of the United Nations Secretary-General â€œSustainable Energy for Allâ€ (SE4All) initiative. SE4All provides the country with a chance to contribute to its global objectives, by addressing national electricity demand where 70Â % of the countryâ€™s energy matrix comes from fossil fuels (the remainder coming from hydropower). In response to the request for assistance to reduce its reliance on costly fuel imports, UNDP support to Dominicaâ€™s efforts is following an approach targeting the adoption of green, low-emission and climate-resilient development strategies (GLECRDS). Through the GLECRDS approach, UNDP is helping other developing countries â€“several of them, small island developing states (SIDS)â€”to combine and sequence different sources of finance to address broader sustainable development concerns.

AB  - As the global demand for energy rises, renewable sources are increasingly becoming more accessible, and oceans show an excellent possibility for the expansion of wind energy. In this work, the structural integrity and the stability during the transportation of an innovative foundation for offshore wind turbines with self-floating capability are evaluated. The structure, with the turbine already installed, is transported to the installation site in its floating position assisted by towing vessels, being then submerged and fixed into the marine soil through suction piles. This paper focuses on the development of adequate numerical models to analyse the magnitude of the loadings subjected into the structure during transportation. FAST and AQWA are used to determine these aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loadings. The obtained results provide the necessary input data for the structural analysis using ANSYS to evaluate the stresses registered on the structure, as well as its vibration modes and stability.

AB  - In this chapter, the efficiency of wave farms in coastal protection under sea-level rise is investigated. A wave farm formed by 11 wave energy converters was modelled off Playa Granada, a gravel-dominated coast in Southern Spain, under three sea-level rise scenarios: the current water level and the water level in 2100 according to a low- and high-emission scenario. In order to explore the effects produced by the wave farm, the natural scenario without wave farm was also studied. Waves were propagated through the wave farm by means of Delft3D-Wave and breaking parameters were obtained in order to apply a longshore sediment transport (LST) formulation. The results obtained with the LST formulation were used in a one-line model to compute the changes in the position of the shoreline at the study site. The results highlight that wave farms are able to decrease beach erosion (shoreline retreat) even under sea-level rise scenarios. That makes wave farms attractive management strategies, as they contribute to the decarbonisation of the energy mix and more efficient in terms of coastal protection under sea-level rise than traditional hard-engineering structures.

AB  - Shipping is a very important source of pollution worldwide. In recent years, numerous actions and measures have been developed trying to reduce the levels of greenhouse gases (GHG) from the marine exhaust emissions in the fight against climate change, boosting the Sustainable Development Goal 13. Following this target, the action of hydrogen as energy vector makes it a suitable alternative to be used as fuel, constituting a very promising energy carrier for energy transition and decarbonization in maritime transport. The objective of this study is to develop an ex-ante environmental evaluation of two promising technologies for vessels propulsion, a H2 Polymeric Electrolytic Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC), and a H2 Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), in order to determine their viability and eligibility compared to the traditional one, a diesel ICE. The applied methodology follows the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) guidelines, considering a functional unit of 1 kWh of energy produced. LCA results reveal that both alternatives have great potential to promote the energy transition, particularly the H2 ICE. However, as technologies readiness level is quite low, it was concluded that the assessment has been conducted at a very early stage, so their sustainability and environmental performance may change as they become more widely developed and deployed, which can be only achieved with political and stakeholder's involvement and collaboration.

AB  - As compared to other renewable energy technologies, the ocean waves are huge, largely untapped energy resource, and the potential in extracting energy is considerable. There is a lack of convergence on the best method of extracting energy from the waves, despite previous innovations, which has generally focused on the concept and design of the wave energy converter (WEC) technology, making the strategies for enhancing the efficiency of WECs important. This paper presents the performance analysis and design optimization of a single-slotted permanent-magnet linear generator. The magnetic field distribution in a cylindrical coordinate has been established. The magnetic field provides a prediction for the thrust force, flux-linkage and back-electromotive force (B-EMF), and also facilitates the characterization of the proposed machine as well as provides a basis for design optimization and dynamic modeling of the system. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has been used for the design optimization of the proposed generator. The proposed generator has been optimized with respect to the leading design parameters Rm/Re and Tm r/TP. Thus, from the results, it can be observed that the generator has a very good efficiency to serve as WEC. Â©2018 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the cluster and scale development of offshore wind power, it has become an indispensable power source for onshore power grids, and thus onshore power grids have put forward higher requirements for the relatability and scheduling of offshore wind power. In this paper, we consider the latest trend of offshore wind power cluster development forming offshore wind interconnection system, and consider the offshore wind interconnection system interconnecting with onshore grid through multi-point grid connection, and study the research of achieving power optimization of offshore wind power multi-point grid connection in offshore wind interconnection system. An offshore wind power optimization model with the optimal tide of the onshore grid as the objective and topology adjustment as the control quantity is developed and solved using the interior point method. Simulation analysis of the improved IEEE39 node system and the offshore wind interconnection transmission system is carried out. The results of the algorithm show that this paper can effectively control the power optimization of offshore wind power between the grid connection points by using the topology adjustment method, to effectively improve the distribution of the onshore grid, meet the power demand of the onshore grid, and improve the reputability of offshore wind power.

AB  - Maritime transport plays an important role in global economic development but also inevitably faces increasing pressures from all sides, such as ship operating cost reduction and environmental protection. An ideal innovation to address these pressures is electric ships, which are more environmentally friendly than conventional manned fuel oil ships. The electric ship is in its early stages. To provide high-quality transportation services, the service network needs to be designed carefully. Therefore, this research simultaneously studies the location of charging stations, charging plans, route planning, ship scheduling, and ship deployment under service time requirements. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model with the objective of minimizing total cost comprised of charging cost, construction cost of charging stations, and fixed cost of ships. A case study using the data of the shipping network along the Yangtze River is conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the model. Valuable managerial insights are also derived from sensitivity analyses.

AB  - Current U.K. practice relating to the disposal of material at sea is reviewed. The use of stabilization technology relating to bulk waste materials, coal ash, oil ash and incinerator ash is discussed. The extension of this technology to inert minestone waste and tailings, contaminated dredged sediments and phosphogypsum is explored. Uses of stabilized wastes are considered in the areas of habitat restoration, coastal defense and fishery enhancement. It is suggested that rehabilitation of marine dump sites receiving loose waste such as pulverized fuel ash (PFA) could be enhanced by the continued dumping of the material but in a stabilized block form, so creating new habitat diversity. Global warming predictions include sea level rise and increased storm frequency. This is of particular concern along the southern and eastern coasts of the U.K. The emphasis of coastal defenses is changing from `'hard'' seawalls to `'soft'' options which include offshore barriers to reduce wave energy reaching the coast. Stabilized waste materials could be included in these and other marine constructions with possible economic benefit. Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), the regulatory authority in England and Wales for marine disposal/construction, policy regarding marine structures and fishery enhancement is outlined. A case is made for the inclusion of fishery enhancement features in future coastal structures. Examples of the productivity of man-made structures are given. Slight modification of planned structures and inclusion of suitable habitat niches could allow for the cultivation of kelp, molluscs, crustacea and fish.

TI  - SEMAFORS: A satellite-based global ship efficiency monitoring, weather forecasting and routing service

VL  - 6
IS  - NA
AB  - Without a doubt shipping is the most efficient mode of transportation for goods. 90 % of Europe's trade with the rest of the world and 43 % of intra-European trade is shipped through its seaports. This success has distracted attention away from the fact that shipping is a major contributor to environmentally damaging emissions and that the shipping industry can improve the efficiency of its operations. In the last decade legislators and industry have become more active seeking solutions to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. SEMAFORS, the ship efficiency monitoring, weather forecasting and optimised routing service is a user focused project in support of the shipping industry. The goal of the SEMAFORS project is to show that an economically justifiable and exploitable solution can be realised to provide substantial benefits to the shipping community in the form of fuel savings whilst providing a positive contribution to safety of operation and help improve port resource utilisation. The SEMAFORS concept seeks to gain improvements by integrating current solutions for weather routing and route planning taking advantage of additional satellite based data such as global sea currents and applying new routing algorithms. It is expected that SEMAFORS will provide an added benefit, namely, a reduction of emissions and hence pollution particularly in coastal areas and ports through a better managed ship arrival and departure time. By reducing the risk during the voyage of incurring delays improved planning should be possible which in turn will make it possible to arrive at a port at the requested time of arrival and allow a smooth passage into the harbour and berth with a minimum of delay. Currently, preference is given to arrive early to port, however this frequently results in long periods of loitering in anchorage areas at the port entrance due to port entry slot unavailability. The demonstration project is an activity carried out by BMT ARGOSS and The Reading University. BMT ARGOSS is a Dutch company experienced in the provisioning of meteorological and oceanographic solutions for the offshore, coastal, harbour and shipping sectors, locally and globally. The Reading University (United Kingdom) hosts the NERC National Centre for Earth Observation (NCEO) and has contributed to solutions used by the UK Met Office and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather forecasting. The service is targeted to vessels with a fuel consumption of 20 metric tons/day or more of Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) - mainly bulk carriers, container ships and tankers - and/or vessels requiring an accurate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) - ferries, cruise ships and LNG carriers among others. Vessels representative of these different shipping sectors participate in the project demonstration trials and validation. In addition, the Port of Rotterdam participates in the project provisioning port-related data and contributing to the service validation. This paper introduces the SEMAFORS concept, background, and architecture, detailing the key technical challenges, and how these respond to the users' needs.

VL  - 10
IS  - 11
AB  - Hybridisation of energy sources in marine vessels has been recognized as one of the feasible solutions to improve fuel economy and achieve global emission reduction targets in the maritime sector. However, the overall performance of a hybrid vessel system is strongly dependent on the efficiency of the energy management system (EMS) that regulates the power-flow amongst the propulsion sources and the energy storage system (ESS). This study develops a simple but production-feasible and efficient EMS for a dynamic positioning (DP) hybrid electric marine vessel (HEMV) and real-time experimental evaluation within a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation environment. To support the development and evaluation, map-based performance models of HEMVs' key components are developed. Control logics that underpin the EMS are then designed and verified. Real-time performance evaluation to assess the performance and applicability of the proposed EMS is conducted, showing the improvement over those of the conventional control strategies. The comparison using key performance indicators (KPIs) demonstrates that the proposed EMS could achieve up to 4.8\% fuel saving per voyage, while the overall system performance remains unchanged as compared to that of the conventional vessel.

AB  - WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ and Japan's IHI Marine United Inc (IHIMU) have concluded a cooperation agreement under which the contra-rotating propeller (CRP) systems developed by IHIMU will be incorporated into WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤'s propulsion solutions used on board diesel-electric driven ships. The cooperation agreement mainly covers the European market, where the environmental demands on shipping operations are becoming increasingly stringent. The HIMU CRP system will achieve 10% better propulsion efficiency compared to conventional diesel-electric propulsion systems, and is applicable to all vessels from small ships to large LNG carriers. This efficiency improvement translates into significant fuel savings, thus enabling a short return on investment as well as reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The application of the CRP system could be extended to include hybrid (mechanical driven and electric driven) propulsion systems, and four-stroke mechanical systems, at a future stage.

AB  - The main storage-related challenges for accelerated deployment of CCS are capacity, confidence and cost. These challenges are to be addressed by amongst others focusing on improving strategies for monitoring and management of the pore pressure distribution in the CO2 storage reservoir. Pressure-driven decision support protocols are to be developed for safe and cost-effective reservoir monitoring. These protocols will enable the operator to maximize CO2 storage capacity and quickly turn monitoring data which suggest non-conformance into plans for corrective actions. A new extended method is developed for inverting and de-noising reservoir pressure and water saturation changes from timelapse AVO differences and time-shifts for the purpose of CCS monitoring and conformance. Detailed reservoir pressure and saturation fronts are obtained for 4D data in the Norwegian offshore, honoring reservoir compartments and fault boundaries found in comparative studies. Application on a CCS candidate field offshore Norway is currently being researched in a synthetic study for purposes of benchmarking, pre-storage analysis, monitoring plans and conformance studies. If back-estimation of pressure and saturation changes is successful, the results for field data become substantially more credible and allow for 4D seismic history matching.

VL  - 8B
IS  - NA
AB  - High fuel consumption coupled with increasing fuel prices, emission regulations and increasing concern about the environment, act as incentives to reduce the energy consumption of ships. However, different barriers hinder the adoption of cost-effective energy saving measures by ship owners and operators. These barriers are the reason for the existence of an 'energy efficiency gap' between the current level of energy efficiency and the potential for development of higher order efficiency. Imperfect information regarding the current level of energy consumption of vessels, availability and application of energy saving measures, and the impact of adopting these measures, form a group of so called 'information barriers'. 1 The main objective of this article is to reduce those information barriers, as faced in shipping and more specifically in the fishing sector. The bond graph methodology is presented as a potential solution to these issues. It is utilized as a modeling and simulation method by which to visualize energy flow in a fishing vessel. The bond graph method is employed to estimate the fuel consumption of the vessel under different operational conditions: Steaming, trawling and hauling of the fishing gear. It is also applied in pinpointing the major energy consuming apparatuses onboard the vessel. In this way knowledge regarding the current levels of energy consumption can be increased. The main energy consumers can then be studied to further improve energy efficiency knowledge and subsequently reduce the energy efficiency gap of the fishing vessel. Finally, the effectiveness of implementing a slow steaming strategy as a possible energy saving mechanism is studied. Copyright Â© 2014 by ASME.

JO  - Continental Shelf Research
PY  - 2012
VL  - 33
IS  - NA
AB  - Successful extraction of tidal stream energy will require a good understanding of flow at a range of scales, including those relating to average energy, variability in energy supply and fatigue. Current and turbulence measurements from the Karori Rip area of Cook Strait, the prime focal region of open-water tidal stream electricity generation in New Zealand, are described. A key issue is that a significant portion of the energy is contained in waters deeper than normally considered for energy extraction. Here we compare shallow and deep sites. Velocity data were derived from acoustic Doppler current profiler moorings, as well as spatial surveys and show flow magnitudes reaching 3.4 m s(-1) in the shallow regions. The maximum speeds in both shallow and deep sites were typically located in the upper part of the measured water column although moored acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) observations showed some complexity in this regard. Benthic boundary-layers were resolved in the bottom similar to 20 m of the water column. Measured turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates epsilon exceeded 10(-5) m(2) s(-3) and estimated maximum epsilon is a factor of 10 greater. This was not distributed evenly through the water column, with stratification and velocity shear clearly persisting, especially around the turn of the tide. The implications for tidal stream energy are that (i) there is sufficient energy resource in the region for a moderate sized array of turbines, (ii) the vertical variability in the flow speed suggests turbines that can operate near the surface would be more effective at accessing the resource, (iii) stratification may persist and influence the scales of turbulence and (iv) wave-current interaction effects will influence any near-surface structure as well as vessel operations.

AB  - The CO2 emission reduction policy of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) recommends that the operation of ships, managed by maritime transport companies, should be energy-efficient. An evaluation method that can determine how successfully a ship implements the energy efficiency plan is proposed in this study. To develop this method, the measures required for energy-efficient ship operations according to the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) operational guidelines were selected. The weights of the selected measures, which indicate how they contribute to the energy-efficient operation of a ship, were derived using a survey based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. Consequently, using these measures and their weights, a new evaluation method was proposed. This evaluation method was applied to shipping companies in South Korea, and their ship operation energy efficiency indices were derived and compared. This evaluation method will be useful to the government and shipping companies in assessing the energy efficiency of ship operations.

AB  - The application of supersonic nozzle separator for dehydration and hydrocarbon dew pointing is a field-proven technology. A study was conducted on the potential of the supersonic nozzle separator technology for CO2 separation from natural gas. A proof of concept testing of the supersonic nozzle prototype is being validated via a multiphase flow loop. The setup consists of a multiphase pump, gas-liquid separators and heat exchangers. Pressure transducers were installed along the supersonic nozzle prototype and the pressure reading is recorded by the data acquisition system. Besides pressure, the temperature inlet, primary and secondary outlets of the tube were also monitored. On-line gas sampling system was installed at the inlet and the outlet of the nozzle prototype to monitor the inlet composition and the effect of the phase separation occurred in the tube to the outlet composition. The pressure profile plotted along the prototype was validated with the Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulation results and significant flow of liquid CO2 was produced during the test. The result of temperature reduction at the nozzle outlet shows that the thermodynamic prediction on gas expansion using de Laval nozzle was proven as per simulation. The outcome from the experiment provides the improvements to the CFD simulation numerical modelling as well as the in-house coding for CO2 separation efficiency.

VL  - 45

AB  - Efforts from all sectors of society including the shipping industry are needed to limit the overall global temperature rise to within 2Â°C of pre-industrial levels by 2050. The hybridisation of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) and Lithium-ion batteries for coastal ship propulsion systems may potentially offer beneficial emission performance. However, such hybrid systems are constrained by power and energy density limitations, lifetime; and costs as well as life-cycle emissions of alternative fuel/energy. There is a lack of holistic design methodology dealing with these uncertainties in the literature. This paper proposes a holistic design methodology for coastal hybrid ships based upon a developed model. The power source sizing problem is solved using constrained mixed-integer multi-objective optimisation in the external layer. The global optimum energy management strategies for an averaged operating profile are obtained from deterministic dynamic programming in the inner layer, while considering power source degradations in the sizing algorithm. The proposed methodology was applied to a coastal ferry to investigate the feasibility and benefit potential of adopting the hybrid PEMFC and battery propulsion system in Matlab. The case studies indicate that the proposed propulsion system can achieve at least a 65% life-cycle greenhouse gas reduction for the considered two cases. Â© 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

TI  - The Physiological Response of Two Green Calcifying Algae from the Great Barrier Reef towards High Dissolved Inorganic and Organic Carbon (DIC and DOC) Availability
JO  - Plos One
PY  - 2015
VL  - 10
IS  - 8
AB  - Increasing dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations associated with ocean acidification can affect marine calcifiers, but local factors, such as high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations through sewage and algal blooms, may interact with this global factor. For calcifying green algae of the genus Halimeda, a key tropical carbonate producer that often occurs in coral reefs, no studies on these interactions have been reported. These data are however urgently needed to understand future carbonate production. Thus, we investigated the independent and combined effects of DIC (pCO(2) 402 mu atm/pH(tot) 8.0 and 996 mu atm/pH(tot) 7.7) and DOC (added as glucose in 0 and 294 mu mol L-1) on growth, calcification and photosynthesis of H. macroloba and H. opuntia from the Great Barrier Reef in an incubation experiment over 16 days. High DIC concentrations significantly reduced dark calcification of H. opuntia by 130 \% and led to net dissolution, but did not affect H. macroloba. High DOC concentrations significantly reduced daily oxygen production of H. opuntia and H. macroloba by 78\% and 43 \%, respectively, and significantly reduced dark calcification of H. opuntia by 70\%. Combined high DIC and DOC did not show any interactive effects for both algae, but revealed additive effects for H. opuntia where the combination of both factors reduced dark calcification by 162 \% compared to controls. Such species-specific differences in treatment responses indicate H. opuntia is more susceptible to a combination of high DIC and DOC than H. macroloba. From an ecological perspective, results further suggest a reduction of primary production for Halimeda-dominated benthic reef communities under high DOC concentrations and additional decreases of carbonate accretion under elevated DIC concentrations, where H. opuntia dominates the benthic community. This may reduce biogenic carbonate sedimentation rates and hence the buffering capacity against further ocean acidification.

AB  - In the very near term, solar energy can provide hot water and space heating, and in the intermediate term, space cooling for both commercial and residential buildings. In the longer term, terrestrial solar power systems based on focused solar energy, wind energy, or ocean thermal gradients are possible regional sources of auxiliary power. Photovoltaic conversion of solar energy to electricity with solar cells could provide supplemental power if the costs of solar cells are reduced. By the year 2000, a satellite solar power station could be a technically and economically viable continuous source of primary electric power whenever needed throughout the world. It will use solar cells to collect the solar radiation, which would then be converted to microwave energy. The microwaves will be beamed to a receiving antenna on earth and be reconverted to electricity. Such solar systems can help meet future energy demands without significant detriment to man's environment.

AB  - With the rising concerns over global climate change associated with rapid depletion of limited fossil fuel resources, worldwide attention has intensified towards the potentials and possibilities of renewable energy sources. In the context of Bangladesh, among multifarious sources of renewables (solar, wind, biomass, tidal and wave power and ocean thermal energy) harnessing of energy from ocean tides, that cogitates both kinetic and potential energy, is a promising option. The former deals with tidal current energy conversion technologies while the latter concept focuses on the tidal barrage approach-similar to hydropower technique. This paper presents an assessment of the potential of tidal barrage technology through the development of a laboratory scale prototype model. The prototype energy extractor is constructed to study and verify the one-way generation method of tidal barrage technology. The model is scaled down to actual generation. A laboratory flume is used to generate a hydraulic head across a sluice gate, considering the upstream as basin side and downstream as the seaside. Water on the basin side is retained by the sluice, creating maximum head difference and thereby generates electricity while traversing through the turbine and rotating the generator. The generated power in the downstream end is measured by an ammeter. The amount of energy generated through the turbine is then compared to the theoretical energy generation. The findings of this study are discussed in relation to the prospects of tidal potential energy and identifies this technology as a preferable option for electricity generation in the suitable locations of the Bay of Bengal.

Some studies suggested that this exotic species outperforms native species in terms of carbon sequestration potential. This study tested the hypothesis that multi-species mangrove plantations might have higher carbon sequestration potential than S. apetala monocultures. Results Our field measurements at Hanjiang River Estuary (Guangdong province, China) showed that the carbon stock (46.0 +/- 3.0 Mg/ha) in S. apetala plantations where the native Kandelia obovata formed an understory shrub layer was slightly higher than that in S. apetala monocultures (36.6 +/- 1.3 Mg/ha). Moreover, the carbon stock in monospecific K. obovata stands (106.6 +/- 1.4 Mg/ha) was much larger than that of S. apetala monocultures. Conclusions Our results show that K. obovata monocultures may have a higher carbon accumulation rate than S. apetala monocultures. Planting K. obovata seedlings in existing S. apetala plantations may enhance the carbon sink associated with these plantations.

VL  - 8
IS  - 10
AB  - This study considers incentive provisions for investment decisions related to waste heat recovery system (WHRS) installations on ships to reduce CO2 emissions and improve ships' engine efficiency. The economic assessment of WHRS installations in the shipping sector is not widely covered in the literature. A reason for this might be that the conventional financial evaluation of sensitive choices is commonly done through capital budgeting methods, which are not flexible enough to integrate future changes in fuel prices and long-term aspects of other costs. Thus, this work evaluates the WHRS investment using the classical budgeting instruments as well as the real-options approach (a more sophisticated approach) to accommodate the presumed expected future changes in the volatile maritime markets. Following the methodology of triangulation, three case studies of ships with varying operational conditions empirically validate the result to depict the practical use of the real-options evaluation method in investment assessment. The capital budgeting analysis reveals that the investment in maritime WHRS technology is only economically favorable under certain frame conditions projected in the work that shows a more realistic assessment of the project.

Firstly, structure of the two wind farms is introduced where all-DC type is based on modular isolated DC/DC converters (MIDC). Then system loss is classified. As wind speed is random and unstable in actual offshore wind farm, average loss is defined and its calculation method is proposed in this paper. Both system loss and electronic device number are calculated. Results show that average loss in MMC-HVDC wind farm is 4.0%, while 2.12% in all-DC wind farm. The number of IGBTs used in all-DC wind farm is much less than that in MMC-HVDC wind farm, which contributes to improve system reliability and economy. Â© 2019 IEEE.

JO  - Proceedings - Spe Annual Technical Conference And Exhibition
PY  - 2015
VL  - 2015-January
IS  - NA
AB  - Methane Gas Hydrates comprise of a single CH4 molecule enclosed in a cage of H2O molecules. These ice-like materials which represent the largest reserves of unconventional natural gas are formed under low temperatures and high pressure generally in the permafrost and the ocean floor region. Out of the many methods under development for production of methane from natural gas hydrates, one of the most promising methods involves the injection of a CO2 into a gas reservoir. By exposing the CH4 hydrate structure to a thermodynamically preferred hydrate former, CO2, it has been observed that a spontaneous displacement and conversion from methane hydrate to CO2 hydrate takes place. Many experiments have proved that large cavities of hydrates prefer occupation by CO2, giving out CH4. This study aims to evaluate the possibility of converting a CO2 hydrate formed in the recovery of CH4 back into CH4 and increasing the recovery and thus improving the efficiency of the methane recovery from CH4 hydrates. If the conditions in the reservoir prevails well then the CH4 formed can be converted to CH4 hydrate hence forming a 'Perpetual Energy Source'. Microbial agents (psychrophilic methanogens) will be used for the in-situ conversion of CO2 to CH4 (requiring the presence of H2). This conversion process reduces CO2 emission and thus protects the environment. Further this study will develop and evaluate a conceptual model for stated the cyclic process. Development of such system which would combine the advantages of the two processes which will create a form of perpetual energy source and would substantially increase the production of natural gas from hydrate reservoirs and will act as form of Carbon-capture and sequestration(CCS). As conventional energy sources are fast depleting, energy requirements and the menace of global warming are rising the corner, it is about time we shift our attention to new and emerging sources like gas hydrates that provide the solution to satisfying the future's needs. This system will provide reliable and affordable energy so that economies of the world can prosper. Â© Copyright 2015, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

AB  - Growing concerns about anthropogenic climate change and its effects on the environment have encouraged significant recent developments towards decarbonizing the energy system. Developments in transportation technology, such as vehicle electrification, can result in significant CO2, particulate matter, and SOx reductions over the lifetime of a vehicle. The shipping industry alone accounted for 2.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2012, however, due to energy requirements and weight restrictions, batteries and direct electrification cannot be used to mitigate emissions. Synthetic fuels, as an indirect electrification option, are a viable solution to achieve emission reduction goals. The purpose of this study is to determine the most cost effective combination of synthetic fuels and fuel cells or internal combustion engines to replace fossil oil as the main propulsion fuel in the shipping industry in 2030 and 2040. The fuels, namely RE-FT-Diesel, RE-LNG, RE-LH2 and RE-MeOH, are analysed for both an internal combustion engine and a fuel cell. The scenarios were analysed by comparing the levelised cost of mobility (LCOM). The LCOM was composed of 5 different facets including the capex of the engines/fuel cells and the tanks, the opex of the engines/fuel cells, the cost of lost cargo space, fuel cost and the CO2 cost. The final unit of comparison was â‚¬/1000DWT-km. It was determined that hydrogen fuel cells were the most likely to replace fossil internal combustion engines if the fuel cells follow their expected development. Significant gains in fuel cell average efficiency and decreases in production cost between today and 2030 and 2040 are factors contributing to the competitiveness. A CO2 cost was set to 61 â‚¬/tCO2 in 2030 and 75 â‚¬/tCO2 in 2040. Most of the other technology combinations are close to competing with fossil diesel with a CO2 price in 2040; however, hydrogen fuel cells are close to competing with fossil fuel without a CO2 cost in 2040.

AB  - Noise generated by offshore impact pile driving radiates into the air, water and sediment. Predicting noise levels around the support structures at sea is required to estimate the effects of the noise on marine life. Based on high demands developing renewable energy source, the United States will begin the first pile driving within one to two years. It is necessary to investigate acoustic impact using our previously verified coupled Finite Element (Commercial FE code Abaqus) and Monterey Miami Parabolic Equation (2D MMPE) models (J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 131(4), p. 3392, 2012). In the present study, we developed a new coupled FE-MMPE model for the identification of zone of injury due to offshore impact pile driving. FE analysis produced acoustic pressure outputs on the surface of the pile which are used as a starting field for a long range 2D MMPE propagation model. It calculates transmission loss for N different azimuthal directions as function of distance from the location of piling with the inputs of corresponding bathymetry and sediment properties. We will present predicted zone of injury by connecting N different distances of equivalent level fishes may get permanent injury due to the first offshore wind farm installation in the U.S. Â© 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

VL  - 34

AB  - Two experiments were performed during the wet and dry seasons to quantify dissolved carbon dynamics and fluxes in the Shark River, a tidal estuary flowing through the largest contiguous mangrove forest in North America (Everglades National Park, Florida, USA). During these experiments, between 80\% and 87\% of the total dissolved carbon pool consisted of inorganic carbon (DIC). Carbon inputs from mangroves to the estuary were slightly higher during the wet season, whereas alkalinity inputs were comparable during the two experiments. Longitudinal dissolved carbon fluxes to the coastal ocean were slightly higher during the wet season (13.53 +/- 0.76 x 10(5) mol day(-1) during the wet and 11.70 +/- 0.32 x 10(5) mol day(-1) during the dry), whereas longitudinal alkalinity flux was comparable during both experiments (10.64 +/- 0.74 in the wet vs. 9.88 +/- 0.30 x 10(5) mol day(-1) during the dry season). Overall, DIC production in surface water, porewater, and groundwater was dominated by oxic mineralization of mangrove-derived organic matter and carbonate dissolution. Carbonate dissolution was the most important alkalinity production process in the system. The experiments show that regardless of the season and hydro-climatic conditions, Shark River receives large inputs of dissolved carbon from the upstream marsh, mangroves, and carbonate dissolution, and that per area, it exports a greater amount of dissolved carbon than many other mangrove-dominated estuaries in the world.

AB  - Recent International Maritime Organization (IMO) decisions with respect to measures to reduce the emissions from maritime greenhouse gases (GHGs) suggest that the collaboration of all major stakeholders of shipbuilding and ship operations is required to address this complex techno-economical and highly political problem efficiently. This calls eventually for the development of proper design, operational knowledge, and assessment tools for the energy-efficient design and operation of ships, as suggested by the Second IMO GHG Study (2009). This type of coordination of the efforts of many maritime stakeholders, with often conflicting professional interests but ultimately commonly aiming at optimal ship design and operation solutions, has been addressed within a methodology developed in the EU-funded Logistics-Based (LOGBASED) Design Project (2004-2007). Based on the knowledge base developed within this project, a new parametric design software tool (PDT) has been developed by the National Technical University of Athens, Ship Design Laboratory (NTUA-SDL), for implementing an energy efficiency design and management procedure. The PDT is an integral part of an earlier developed holistic ship design optimization approach by NTUA-SDL that addresses the multi-objective ship design optimization problem. It provides Pareto-optimum solutions and a complete mapping of the design space in a comprehensive way for the final assessment and decision by all the involved stakeholders. The application of the tool to the design of a large oil tanker and alternatively to container ships is elaborated in the presented paper. Copyright Â© 2011 by Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

TI  - The potential contribution of terrestrial nature-based solutions to a national `net zero' climate target
JO  - Journal Of Applied Ecology
PY  - 2021
VL  - 58
IS  - 11
AB  - Many national governments have incorporated nature-based solutions (NbS) in their plans to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. However, uncertainties persist regarding both feasibility and consequences of major NbS deployment. Using the United Kingdom as a national-level case study, we examined the potential contribution of three terrestrial NbS: peatland restoration, saltmarsh creation and woodland creation. While there is substantial political and societal interest in these three NbS, they also have strong potential for competition with other land uses, which will be a critical barrier to substantial deployment. We conducted a national mapping exercise to assess the potential area available for woodland creation. We then assessed the combined climate change mitigation potential to 2100 for the three NbS options under a range of ambition levels. In line with the most ambitious targets examined, 2 Mha of land is potentially available for new woodland. However, climate change mitigation benefits of woodland are strongly dependent on management choices. By 2100, scenarios with a greater proportion of broadleaved woodlands outsequester non-native conifer plantations, which are limited by regular timber harvesting. Peatland restoration offers the greatest mitigation per unit area, whilst the contribution from saltmarsh creation is limited by the small areas involved. Overall, the contribution of these NbS to the United Kingdom's net zero emissions target is relatively modest. Even with the most ambitious targets considered here, by 2100, the total cumulative mitigation from the three NbS is equivalent to only 3 years' worth of UK emissions at current levels. Policy implications. Major deployment of nature-based solutions (NbS) is possible in the United Kingdom but reaching `net zero' primarily requires substantial and sustained reductions in fossil fuel use. However, facilitating these NbS at the national scale could offer many additional benefits for people and biodiversity. This demands that policy-makers commit to a UK-wide strategic approach that prioritises the `nature' aspect of NbS. In the push to reach `net zero', climate change mitigation should not be used to justify land management practices that threaten biodiversity ambitions.

AB  - In Korea, fishing boats account for 65,452 out of 71,174 coastal ships, and aging ships are a leading cause of environmental problems and economic loss. To solve this problem, the government has enacted a policy to promote the development and distribution of environmental vessels. Electric propulsion systems and hybrid systems are suggested as alternatives. However, to study whether this hybrid system is environmentally friendly, a system for measuring the performance of conventional diesel-powered ships was developed and measured. A case study applying the battery hybrid system was analyzed through a Matlab/Simulink simulation, and the effect of reducing the carbon dioxide emissions by 7.6\% was verified. In addition, comparing with a case where the load-sharing optimal control was introduced, we proved that the carbon dioxide reduction with the controller was 10.7\%. By applying the results of this study to various countries with different fuel production processes through the LCA technique, it was confirmed that the battery hybrid system is eco-friendly from the energy production stage, rather than unconditionally, according to the national power production method. Additional research is needed to reflect the aging trend of the entire fleet and to create a detailed category classification through future research.

JO  - International Journal Of Greenhouse Gas Control
PY  - 2017
VL  - 66

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the dominant technologies to tackle the global warming issue. The transport of CO2 for geological storage may become economically feasible by ship when the storage site location is off-shore and installment of an off-shore pipeline requires a huge capital cost. Ship transportation requires the captured CO2 to be in liquid phase under pressurized thermodynamic conditions. The injection of liquid CO2 into the geological reservoir involves pressurization and heating in order to maintain the safe well head operating conditions. This study presents two alternative top side injection process designs that can reduce the power requirement compared to the base case design. The base case design and alternative designs are simulated using Aspen HYSYSÂ® in order to decide the process design variables. The results show that the well head temperature of 5 Â°C should be maintained to avoid any hydrate formation in the injection well or at the well outlet, while, utilizing the minimum amount of energy for the injection. The study employed two-stage rankine cycle in order to extract the cold energy available from the liquid CO2 before its injection into the reservoir. The alternative designs also proposed to utilize a vapor return line in order to maintain the CO2 vessel pressure within safe limits by performing a dynamic simulation. The results show that the alternative design 1 and alternative design 2 consume almost 28% and 27.9% less power compared to that of the base case design. The specific cost per unit ton of CO2 injected for the three designs came out to be 0.75 $ 0.69 $ and 0.69 $ respectively. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been done in order to investigate the effect of some important variables in the study. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The stringent requirements of the IMO's emission regulations call for alternative fuels and new ways of powering ships. However, the IMO predicts that technology which could reduce ship emission to zero, will either not be available, nor cost-efficient over the next 40 years. However, technological innovations in ship power & propulsion systems; such as duel-fuel LNG engines, and the utilization of energy storage technology in the form of lithium-ion batteries have been found to reduce harmful emissions; and are already utilized to quite some extent in the offshore support fleet. This paper elaborates on the reliability and sustainability of newer ship power technologies, where equal to existing levels of reliability are expected as a minimum.

AB  - Taiwan imports more than 99% of her energy and suffers from climate change effects such as rising ocean level. Therefore, energy insecurity and GHG emissions offset are two serious problems facing Taiwan. This paper examines the possibilities for domestic bioenergy production in Taiwan utilizing set-aside land. Three bioenergy alternatives are examined: pyrolysis-based bioelectricity, conventional bioelectricity and ethanol. We examine the comparative economics and choices among these alternatives under current Taiwanese agricultural system policies and also under altered energy and greenhouse gas/carbon prices. Biochar, produced from pyrolysis, is also investigated for different uses: whether it is best used as an energy source and/or a soil amendment. The study employs modified Taiwanese Agricultural Sector Model (TASM) to simulate the effects of the alternatives in the face of energy and greenhouse gases prices. Results show that ethanol production is chosen under current conditions but that this is replaced by pyrolysis-based bioelectricity when the GHG price is high. The results also indicate that Taiwan's energy security can be enhanced by domestic bioenergy production and up to1.59% of total GHG emissions can be offset.

AB  - Human activities are altering the ocean in many different ways. The surface ocean is warming and, as a result, it is becoming more stratified and sea level is rising. There is no clear evidence yet of a slowing in ocean circulation, although this is predicted for the future. As anthropogenic CO2 permeates into the ocean, it is making sea water more acidic, to the detriment of surface corals and probably many other calcifiers. Once acidification reaches the deep ocean, it will become more corrosive to CaCO3, leading to a considerable reduction in the amount of CaCO3 accumulating on the deep seafloor. There will be a several thousand-year-long interruption to CaCO3 sedimentation at many points on the seafloor. A curious feedback in the ocean, carbonate compensation, makes it more likely that global warming and sea-level rise will continue for many millennia after CO2 emissions cease.

VL  - 2019-June
IS  - NA
AB  - One of the thorny problems perplexing the maritime industry is to comply with existing and soon-to-be-enacted regulations towards emissions reduction from shipping. This problem has been discussed in this study under three viewpoints: i) the marine engine efficiency, ii) the decision-making process for selecting the technologies for reducing air emissions from shipping and iii) the challenges in the shipping industry during the era of digitalization. In the section of the marine engine efficiency, the fundamental laws of thermodynamics in relation to a Carnot cycle/heat engine have been illustrated to show the maximum efficiency that an engine can achieve within its operational temperature range. In the section of the decision-making process, the selection of technologies for reducing emissions from shipping, a variety of possible options has been discussed: e.g. using compliant fuels with low sulphur content in the current machinery; integrating an emission abatement technology such as marine scrubber as an after-treatment device; opting for alternative fuels such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) or Methanol and future ship propulsion with an array of alternatives. Nevertheless, it can be a challenge for decision-makers (shipowners and operators) to select the most suitable alternatives for regulatory compliance in reducing emissions from shipping. It involves with multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) in which a number of alternative options are assessed with regard to multiple factors and sub-factors as described in this study. In the section of the challenges for the shipping industry in the era of digitalization, Advanced Data Analytics for ship performance monitoring is considered to overcome the handling challenges in large-scale ship performance and navigation data sets.

AB  - With the recent third round of site allocations for offshore wind farms in extended UK waters, new challenges for efficient operation and maintenance require new solutions to be provided for technician and equipment transfer out to 200 nm from shore. Based on the ongoing work at Cranfield University, a representative methodology for the design of an innovative Aerodynamically Alleviated Marine Vehicle (AAMV) is demonstrated. This process builds upon previous work including theoretical and experimental models, culminating with the summary of a preliminary design for a vessel of similar capability. Utilising aerodynamic efficiencies of wing-in-ground effect (WIG) craft, it is shown how a vessel can be equipped with lifting surfaces in order to alleviate the weight of the vehicle, leading to a lower effective displacement, drag and required power. The design spiral of conventional marine craft is modified to include the relevant considerations to equilibrate the aerodynamic forces and moments. Some areas of current and future work are discussed, with experimental results presented. Â© 2015: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.

Fuel savings can be realized by bettering component operating points, yet this requires correct sizing matched to the expected usage.

AB  - There is a long-term mismatch between the power generation and electricity demand of offshore wind power generation, and a supporting energy storage system is required to connect and consume the power of the offshore wind power platform. In this paper, a low-investment solar-assisted Carnot battery energy storage system is designed for offshore wind power platforms, which uses electricity generated from renewable energy (solar energy) to drive a heat pump cycle to store thermal energy in a phase change material in a thermal storage tank. The thermal energy is then transferred to the ORC cycle to generate stable electrical power when needed. In this paper, the thermodynamic model of the system is established, and the boundary conditions are designed according to the actual environment of the offshore wind power platform, and the most suitable circulating working fluid is selected from many aspects. When the low temperature heat pump cycle uses acetone refrigerant and the organic Rankine cycle uses R365mfc refrigerant and when the heat storage temperature is from 130 Â°C to 160 Â°C, the power ratio is 89.1% to 130.9%, the equipment cost is low, and its efficiency is low. Therefore, acetone and r365mfc may be the best refrigerant choice. Â© 2022 IEEE.

Here we introduce the first EXPORTS field deployment to Ocean Station Papa in the Northeast Pacific Ocean during summer of 2018, providing context for other papers in this special collection. The experiment was conducted with two ships: a Process Ship, focused on ecological rates, BGC fluxes, temporal changes in food web, and BGC and optical properties, that followed an instrumented Lagrangian float; and a Survey Ship that sampled BGC and optical properties in spatial patterns around the Process Ship. An array of autonomous underwater assets provided measurements over a range of spatial and temporal scales, and partnering programs and remote sensing observations provided additional observational context. The oceanographic setting was typical of late-summer conditions at Ocean Station Papa: a shallow mixed layer, strong vertical and weak horizontal gradients in hydrographic properties, sluggish sub-inertial currents, elevated macronutrient concentrations and low phytoplankton abundances. Although nutrient concentrations were consistent with previous observations, mixed layer chlorophyll was lower than typically observed, resulting in a deeper euphotic zone. Analyses of surface layer temperature and salinity found three distinct surface water types, allowing for diagnosis of whether observed changes were spatial or temporal. The 2018 EXPORTS field deployment is among the most comprehensive biological pump studies ever conducted. A second deployment to the North Atlantic Ocean occurred in spring 2021, which will be followed by focused work on data synthesis and modeling using the entire EXPORTS data set.

AB  - Polyunsaturated fatty acids are well known for their protective properties in relation to different skin diseases. Although seaweeds possess a low lipid fraction, they could act as an alternative renewable source of polyunsaturated fatty acids whenever other valuable seaweed components are also valorized. In this study, a biorefinery process using Mastocarpus stellatus as a model seaweed was proposed. The process started with the supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of the lipid and phenolic fractions. The influence of pressure during extraction with pure supercritical CO2 was studied while operating at a selected temperature and solvent flow rate. Kinetic data obtained during the ethanol-modified supercritical CO2 extraction were fitted to the spline model. Sequential processing was proposed with (i) pure CO2 to obtain a product with 30% PUFA content and Ï‰-3:Ï‰6 ratio 1:1, (ii) ethanol-modified CO2 to extract phenolics, and (iii) microwave-assisted subcritical water extraction operating under previously optimized conditions for the extraction of phenolics, carrageenan and protein fractions. The composition of the supercritical extracts showed potential for use in both dietary and topical applications in skin care products. The remaining solids are suitable for the extraction of other valuable fractions. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Improvement of the power system reliability by prediction of wind power generation
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2007
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The integration of wind farms into the electricity grid has become an important challenge for the utilization and control of electric power systems, because of the fluctuating and intermittent behaviour of wind power generation. Wind power predictions improve the economical and technical integration of large capacities of wind energy into the existing electricity grid. Trading, balancing, grid operation and safety increase the importance of forecasting electrical outputs from wind farms. Thus wind power forecast systems have to be integrated into the control room of the transmission system operator (TSO). Very high requirements of reliability and safety make this integration especially challenging. The pooling of several large offshore wind farms into clusters in the GW range will make new options feasible for an optimized integration of wind power. The geographically distributed onshore wind farms will be aggregated to clusters, for the purpose of operating these wind farms as one large (virtual) wind power plant. For this purpose, a new structure, the wind farm cluster will be introduced. All wind farms, which are directly or indirectly connected to one transmission network node will be associated to one wind farm cluster. The wind farm cluster manager (WCM) assists the TSO by operating the cluster according to the requirements of the power transmission system. Non-controllable wind farms within a wind farm cluster are supported by controllable ones.

VL  - 45

AB  - The shipping sector is likely to go through a fuel transition in the coming decades as a result of the increasing regulation and the commitment of part of the ship-owning community to reduce its environmental impact. If shipping is to limit its greenhouse gas emissions so that global warming is maintained below 2 degrees C as agreed by the IMO in April 2018 and in line with 2015 Paris Agreement, urgent action is needed in terms of environmentally friendly technologies uptake, operational measures and new forms of propulsion based on alternative fuels. While some research has appeared in the last decade on operational and technological measures aimed at reducing emissions for shipping, limited focus has been put on the economic and environmental impacts of a fuel shift. This research aims at analysing the alternative fuel options available for shipping and assess the emission reductions obtainable through a fuel shift. The paper also provides insights on the costs associated with such fuel transition. Through the development of a simulation based on existing information of alternative fuel costs and availability, the paper shows that a maximum of 24\% greenhouse gas emission reduction can be achieved by using alternative fuels. Such reduction, however, can be obtained at varying cost levels. An optimal fleet mix is provided for 2050 as guidance for policy makers and the shipping sector.

TI  - Carbon budget of coral reef systems: an overview of observations in fringing reefs, barrier reefs and atolls in the Indo-Pacific regions
JO  - Tellus Series B-chemical And Physical Meteorology
PY  - 2003
VL  - 55
IS  - 2
AB  - The seawater CO2 system and carbon budget were examined in coral reefs of wide variety with respect to topographic types and oceanographic settings in the Indo-Pacific oceans. A system-level net organic-to-inorganic carbon production ratio (R-OI) is a master parameter for controlling the carbon cycle in coral reef systems, including their sink/source behavior for atmospheric CO2. A reef system with R-OI less than approximately 0.6 has a potential for releasing CO2. The production ratio, however, is not easy to estimate on a particular reef. Instead, observations planned to detect the offshore-lagoon difference in partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and a graphic approach based on a total alkalinity-dissolved inorganic carbon diagram can reveal system-level performance of the carbon cycle in coral reefs. Surface pCO(2) values in the lagoons of atolls and barrier reefs were consistently higher than those in their offshore waters, showing differences between 6 and 46 muatm, together with a depletion in total alkalinity up to 100 mumol kg(-1), indicating predominant carbonate production relative to net organic carbon production. Reef topography, especially residence time of lagoon water, has a secondary effect on the magnitude of the offshore-lagoon pCO(2) difference. Terrestrial influence was recognized in costal reefs, including the GBR lagoon and a fringing reef of the Ryukyu Islands. High carbon input appears to enhance CO2 efflux to the atmosphere because of their high dissolved C:P ratios. Coral reefs, in general, act as an alkalinity sink and a potentially CO2-releasing site due to carbonate precipitation and land-derived carbon.

TI  - Carbon cycling and storage in mangrove forests
JO  - Annual Review Of Marine Science
PY  - 2014
VL  - 6
IS  - NA
AB  - Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests of the tropics. They are highly productive ecosystems with rates of primary production equal to those of tropical humid evergreen forests and coral reefs. Although mangroves occupy only 0.5 of the global coastal area, they contribute 10-15 (24 Tg C y-1) to coastal sediment carbon storage and export 10-11 of the particulate terrestrial carbon to the ocean. Their disproportionate contribution to carbon sequestration is now perceived as a means for conservation and restoration and a way to help ameliorate greenhouse gas emissions. Of immediate concern are potential carbon losses to deforestation (90-970 Tg C y -1) that are greater than these ecosystems' rates of carbon storage. Large reservoirs of dissolved inorganic carbon in deep soils, pumped via subsurface pathways to adjacent waterways, are a large loss of carbon, at a potential rate up to 40 of annual primary production. Patterns of carbon allocation and rates of carbon flux in mangrove forests are nearly identical to those of other tropical forests. Copyright Â© 2014 by Annual Reviews.

AB  - Offshore wind energy resources are more abundant than on land. However, sea and land winds have different meteorological elements so offshore wind resource assessments need to take the impact of the temporal and spatial characteristics of the offshore wind resources into consideration. Data from an offshore wind measurement mast was used to study offshore wind distributions at different time scales. The EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm was used to study the differences in offshore wind distributions between day and night, which is normally not considered in traditional wind assessment methods. The spatial characteristics of offshore winds will than analyzing using a machine learning algorithm, Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, and a parameter replacement scheme in discrete calculations and in an ocean surface aerodynamic roughness model. This method efficiently reflects the impact of ocean surface aerodynamic roughness changes on the vertical variations of the wind speed that is not considered in traditional wind shear formula. The results show the temporal and spatial characteristics of the offshore wind resources as a basis for better offshore wind assessments for planning offshore wind farms.

JO  - American Society Of Mechanical Engineers, Heat Transfer Division, (publication) Htd
PY  - 1993
VL  - 246
IS  - NA
AB  - Factors controlling the capacity of the ocean for taking up anthropogenic CO2 include carbon chemistry, distribution of alkalinity, pCO2 and total concentration of dissolved CO2, sea-air pCO2 difference, gas exchange rate across the sea-air interface, biological carbon pump, ocean water circulation and mixing, and dissolution of carbonate in deep sea sediments. A general review of these processes is given and models of ocean-atmosphere system based on our understanding of these regulating processes are used to estimate the magnitude of CO2 uptake by the ocean. We conclude that the ocean can absorb up to 35% of the fossil fuel emission. Direct measurements show that 55% of CO2 from fossil fuel burning remains in the atmosphere. The remaining 10% is not accounted for by atmospheric increases and ocean uptake. In addition, it is estimated that an amount equivalent to 30% of recent annual fossil fuel emissions is released into the atmosphere as a result of deforestation and farming. To balance global carbon budget, a sizable carbon sink besides the ocean is needed. Storage of carbon in terrestrial biosphere as a result of CO2 fertilization is a potential candidate for such missing carbon sinks.

AB  - Ships are moving land in the vast ocean and are an indispensable means of transportation for humanity. At present, green power systems and low-carbon fuels are the development trend of energy-saving, emission-reduction, and low-carbon consumption of green ships. However, existing ships have many waste heat emissions and considerable noise pollution from shipboard electromechanical equipment. Based on the above issues, this study combined SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cells) with a GT (Gas Turbine) and ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle). It proposed a waste heat-driven composite energy recovery system for the green power ships. Based on the feasibility analysis of single SOFC performance and waste heat utilization, combined with GT-ORC system, the thermodynamic model construction, working medium selection, energy, exergy and economy (3E) analysis of the whole system are carried out. The result shows that among the effective energy destruction of the entire system, the endogenous effective energy loss accounts for 89.73\%. The avoidable-endogenous energy destruction of GT accounted for 92.95\%, which has a significant improvement in saving space. The investment cost of heat exchanger accounts for the highest proportion, which is 22.62\%. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on strengthening the heat exchange process to reduce the investment cost. The evaporative pressure and isentropic efficiency seriously affect the investment ratio of the system, in which the investment of expander and working medium pump increases by 34.6\% and 153.3\%, respectively, within the allowable working conditions.

AB  - The observed and projected increase in emission of greenhouse gases, with attendant effects on global warming and sea level rise, have raised interests in identifying mitigation options. Terrestrial C sequestration involves capture of atmospheric C through photosynthesis and storage in biota, soil and wetlands. Land use, vegetation and soil management have a strong impact on the biotic processes of C sequestration. Losses of C from the terrestrial ecosystems are exacerbated by deforestation, biomass burning, plowing, resource-based and subsistence agriculture, and practices that mine soil fertility and deplete the soil organic C (SOC) pool. Biomass burning may also produce charcoal, which is an inert carbon with long residence time. Practices that enhance C sequestration include afforestation and reforestation, conservation tillage and mulch farming, integrated nutrient management and adopting systems with high biodiversity. Net C sequestration within an ecosystem can be assessed by taking into account the hidden C costs of fertilizers, pesticides, tillage, irrigation and other input. Restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems has a vast potential of C sequestration. The Kyoto Protocol provides for C sequestration in terrestrial sinks and C trading through Clean Development Mechanisms. Terrestrial C sequestration, besides being a win-win strategy, offers a window of opportunity for the first few decades of the 21(st) century. It is a natural process of reducing the rates of gaseous emissions while alternatives to fossil fuel take effect.

JO  - Limnology And Oceanography
PY  - 2022
VL  - 67
IS  - 2, SI
AB  - Seagrasses are globally important ecosystems that can help mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon (C). The net impact seagrass meadows have on the climate, however, also depends on methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. By not accounting for CH4 and N2O fluxes, we may be overestimating or underestimating the true C sequestration capacity of seagrasses. Yet, few observations of seagrass CH4 and N2O fluxes are available. Here, we quantified summer, dark/light CH4 and N2O fluxes across the sediment-water interface from seagrass meadows (Zostera marina) and adjacent nonvegetated sediments in two temperate bays with different environmental characteristics. On two occasions, we also estimated system wide air-sea CH4 and N2O fluxes. We found the CH4 fluxes across the sediment-water interface varied between the two sites with one site emitting CH4 from vegetated sediments and a net zero flux at the other site. N2O fluxes across the sediment-water interface were not different from zero regardless of seagrass presence, although when we did measure a flux, there was more often a net uptake of N2O. We estimated that both systems were small net sources of CH4 and N2O to the atmosphere; however, the sediments are not likely the source of CH4 and N2O emitted to the atmosphere in the systems. Although the diffusive fluxes measured here are lower than those reported in the literature, they are consistent with our current understanding of seagrass sediments being variable sources of CH4 and potentially a negligible source or sink of N2O.

AB  - Power quality is an important issue in offshore wind power grid connection. This paper introduces a domestic offshore wind power harmonic anomaly case. Firstly, based on the distribution parameters of long-distance submarine cables, the frequency domain mathematical model of 220kV main circuit of offshore wind power is established, and the resonant points and harmonic amplification characteristics of offshore wind power are calculated through different harmonic sources. Secondly, the field test is designed and implemented. It is proved by experiments that the main reason of harmonic exceeding is that the long-distance submarine cable amplifies the background harmonic of power grid. Finally, Moore-penrose generalized inverse matrix was used to analyze harmonic impedance of the grid-connection, via different experimental data of the marine cables. A 220 kV high voltage passive filter for offshore wind power is designed to adjust the harmonic impedance of offshore wind power and suppress the excessive harmonic.

TI  - Shellfish Face Uncertain Future in High CO2 World: Influence of Acidification on Oyster Larvae Calcification and Growth in Estuaries
JO  - Plos One
PY  - 2009
VL  - 4
IS  - 5
AB  - Background: Human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide by 36\% during the past 200 years. One third of all anthropogenic CO2 has been absorbed by the oceans, reducing pH by about 0.1 of a unit and significantly altering their carbonate chemistry. There is widespread concern that these changes are altering marine habitats severely, but little or no attention has been given to the biota of estuarine and coastal settings, ecosystems that are less pH buffered because of naturally reduced alkalinity. Methodology/Principal Findings: To address CO2-induced changes to estuarine calcification, veliger larvae of two oyster species, the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and the Suminoe oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis) were grown in estuarine water under four pCO(2) regimes, 280, 380, 560 and 800 mu atm, to simulate atmospheric conditions in the pre-industrial era, present, and projected future concentrations in 50 and 100 years respectively. CO2 manipulations were made using an automated negative feedback control system that allowed continuous and precise control over the pCO(2) in experimental aquaria. Larval growth was measured using image analysis, and calcification was measured by chemical analysis of calcium in their shells. C. virginica experienced a 16\% decrease in shell area and a 42\% reduction in calcium content when pre-industrial and end of 21(st) century pCO(2) treatments were compared. C. ariakensis showed no change to either growth or calcification. Both species demonstrated net calcification and growth, even when aragonite was undersaturated, a result that runs counter to previous expectations for invertebrate larvae that produce aragonite shells. Conclusions and Significance: Our results suggest that temperate estuarine and coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to the expected changes in water chemistry due to elevated atmospheric CO2 and that biological responses to acidification, especially calcifying biota, will be species-specific and therefore much more variable and complex than reported previously.

AB  - Depleted gas fields are one of the potential target for CO2 storage given its proven capacity, sealing structures and existing infrastructure that may be suitable to be re-used, hence provide confidence in storage security and potential cost-saving. A carbonate gas field from Sarawak Basin, offshore Malaysia had been in production from 2002 and 2006. The field had reached its targeted recovery factor of about 70% and ready to be abandoned, making it a good candidate for CO2 storage site. Data such as hydrocarbon production history, core and fluid samples are extensively available to conduct the CO2 storage study for this field. The petrophysical properties are very heterogeneous with average porosity of about 30% and permeability ranging from 10 to 300 millidarcy. A reservoir-scale reactive transport simulation was carried out on actual field geometry and incorporating the heterogeneity of reservoir properties. The reservoir-scale simulation was calibrated with a set of coreflood experiments. The aim is to assess the porosity and permeability changes due to CO2 injection in a CH4-CO2-H2O system. Also, to predict the long-term fate of the CO2 over 100 years after injection and the CO2 trapping mechanisms. Effect of temperature on fluid-rock interactions during CO2 injection was also investigated. Â© 81st EAGE Conference and Exhibition 2019. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents the design and implementation of a web-based Participatory Geographic Information System (PGIS) framework intended for offshore wind suitability analysis. The PGIS prototype presented here integrates GIS and decision-making tools that are intended to involve different stakeholders and the public for solving complex planning problems and building consensus. Public involvement from the early planning stage of projects with a spatial nature is very important for future legitimacy and acceptance of these projects. Therefore, developing and executing a system that facilitates effective public involvement for resolving contentious issues can help in fostering long-lasting agreements. The prototype here is a distributed and asynchronous PGIS that combines a discussion forum, a mapping tool and a decision tool. The potential strengths and benefits of this PGIS are demonstrated in a hypothetical case study in Lake Erie, northern Ohio. In the hypothetical case study, participants evaluate the importance of three decision alternatives using different evaluation criteria for expressing their individual preferences. The individual preferences are aggregated by Borda Count (BC) method for generating the group solution, which is used for synthesizing the different evaluation aspects such as the importance of criteria, ranking of the decision alternatives and planning issues related to environmental and socio-economic concerns from the participants.

TI  - Toward Carbon-Neutral Concrete through Biocharâ€“Cementâ€“Calcium Carbonate Composites: A Critical Review
JO  - Sustainability (switzerland)
PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 8
AB  - High-density, high-permanence forms of carbon storage are in demand to save storage space on land or at sea while allowing the world to reach its climate targets. Biochar and calcium carbonate are two such forms that have been considered largely separately in the literature for carbon storage. In this paper, we consider how biochar and calcium carbonate might interact when they are used together with cement as part of a carbon storage system, ideally to form a carbon-neutral concrete. The carbon storage system stores atmospherically absorbed CO2 within concrete, thereby reducing carbon in the atmosphere. In addition, such a system will help in reducing cement usage, thus reducing the need for clinker in cement manufacturing and directly reducing CO2 emissions that result from limestone calcination during clinker manufacturing. Another benefit of such a composite storage system is its use in building structures, a use that has positive environmental and social impact. Thus, further research on the properties of this composite material is warranted. This paper explores the literature on the use of biochar combined with calcium carbonate and cement as carbon storage material. The use of recycled carbon aggregates (RCAs) and LC3 concrete as part of this approach is reviewed. The paper also addresses the possible compressive strength range of the biocharâ€“cementâ€“calcium carbonate composite material, along with other performance expectations. Obstacles to scaling the use of carbon-neutral concrete are identified and an array of research directions are presented, with the goal of improving carbon-neutral concrete and its use.

AB  - Majority of the goods are transported by sea for trade and commerce. The ships are propelled and powered by large diesel engines running cost efficiently on residual fuel oil. The high viscosity fuel containing a large percentage of carbon, sulfur, chlorine, sodium and catalytic fines can cause low temperature corrosion, high temperature corrosion and abrasive wear. These problems are successfully resolved by purification, heating and special design of critical parts of the engine to assure very long life for the engines. Tighter controls on emissions from on-road vehicles and increasing strength of merchant navy have tilted the balance towards emissions from marine engines. Therefore, the new generation heavy fuel engine will be environment friendly. For the common rail system, finer filtration is required as the operating clearances are less. In addition, loss of lubricity of fuel due to reduction in sulfur demands steps to protect the fuel injection equipment from undue wear.

This paper presents technical and functional requirements specific to the operationalised middle of life cycle phase. These requirements have been established from a comprehensive literature review and focus group with maritime vessel designers and engineers. Copyright Â© The Author(s) 20222.

AB  - Ship-borne air emissions have a significant impact on air pollution as well as global warming, especially in coastal areas. CO2 is the major component of the greenhouse gases (GHGs). Naval vessels constitute a notable part of the total fleet of sea going ships and the fuel burnt in the energy systems of naval vessels is strongly proportional to CO2 emissions. Existing fossil fuel reserves are apparently decreasing, so interrelated fuel efficiency and emissions should be handled together. The increasing need for ensuring safety at sea and protecting sea resources, results in an increase in the need to build new vessels that will provide these missions. Offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) are reasonable solutions to perform these missions compared to naval vessels such as frigates and corvettes, in terms of high investment and life cycle costs. Main air emission source of an OPV is energy system which consists of prime movers and auxiliary engines. This system should comply with mission profile assigned to OPV, providing high fuel efficiency and low air emission. This study analyzes fuel efficiency and proposes an approach for estimation of CO2 emissions of four alternative energy systems for a new generation OPV at the conceptual design phase.

TI  - Is All Seagrass Habitat Equal? Seasonal, Spatial, and Interspecific Variation in Productivity Dynamics Within Mediterranean Seagrass Habitat
JO  - Frontiers In Marine Science
PY  - 2022
VL  - 9
IS  - NA
AB  - Seagrass meadows' ability to capture carbon through sequestering autochthonous carbon via photosynthesis means they could represent a potential nature-based solution to rising carbon emissions. In multispecies seagrass communities, and due to species introduction or predicted range shifts, it is important to know which species deliver different carbon sequestration gains to inform conservation actions. Large benthic chamber experiments (volume = 262L) assessed the seasonal and spatial variation in metabolism dynamics of the endemic and dominant Mediterranean seagrass, P. oceanica whilst small benthic chamber experiments (volume = 7L) compared the dynamics between, P. oceanica the native C. nodosa and non-native H. stipulacea. Within shallow P. oceanica edge habitat lower Net Apparent Productivity (NAP) occurs in autumn ( x over bar = 1.3, SD +/- 2.95 O-2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) compared to summer ( x over bar = 9.9, SD +/- 2.75 O-2 mmol m(-2) d(-1) corresponding with periods of light limiting and light saturating conditions, but it remains overall autotrophic annually (2.3 C mol m(-2) yr(-1)). However, spatial heterogeneity exists, the center areas of P. oceanica were more productive (NAP x over bar =19.7, SD +/- 3.83 O-2 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) compared to edge habitat with spatial changes in productivity relating to plant surface area (96\%), shoot density (81\%), blade length (72\%) and seagrass percentage cover (64\%). Under comparative conditions in a sparse multispecies area of the meadow the species demonstrated different capacities for carbon fixation. H. stipulacea was carbon positive and P. oceanica fluctuated between positive and negative carbon balance suggesting both can maintain a balance between carbon fixation and carbon utilised for metabolic activity. In contrast the C. nodosa here would be expected to deteriorate as it was utilising carbon more than it was fixing (NAP(N) (2) ( x over bar = -0.0012, SD +/- 0.0007 O-2 mmol cm(-2) d(-1)). This study demonstrates that not all seagrass habitat is equal. If seagrass meadows are to play a part in mitigating CO2 emissions, variability in primary productivity within seagrass meadows needs to be accounted for to produce accurate total fixed carbon estimates, and subsequently autochthonous carbon sequestration estimates. This means seagrass meadow species composition and the condition of these meadows must be better understood.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 46
IS  - 76
AB  - The Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) current coastal/local research vessel, the R/V Robert Gordon Sproul, is nearing the end of its service life and will soon require replacement. This study compares three potential variants for an R/V Sproul replacement vessel (SRV): a Baseline SRV consisting of a traditional diesel-electric powertrain, a Battery Hybrid SRV (battery/diesel-electric) and a Hydrogen Hybrid SRV (hydrogen fuel cell/diesel-electric). All three variants meet the science mission requirements of the SRV but with varying levels of zero-emission runtime, energy efficiency and emissions. The Battery Hybrid SRV can provide 2.5 h of zero emissions (battery only) operation, but could not complete any of the identified SRV science missions without also engaging the diesel generators. In contrast, the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV can provide 23.4 h of zero emission (hydrogen only) runtime, and can complete 74% of the SRV science missions solely with zero-emission operation. The superior performance of the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV is attributable to the higher volumetric energy storage density of the LH2/fuel cell combination. The capital costs of these vessels are estimated to be: âˆ¼ $21.4 M for the diesel-electric Baseline SRV, âˆ¼ $26.0 M for the Battery Hybrid SRV vessel and âˆ¼ $34.4 M for the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV. The â€œwell-to-wavesâ€ (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant emissions were estimated using various sourcings for the diesel fuel, electricity and hydrogen fuel. The lowest emission levels are achieved with the Hydrogen Hybrid variant using 100% renewable hydrogen. The annual WTW GHG emissions from the Hydrogen Hybrid using renewable LH2 in combination with fossil diesel in the hybrid arrangement yields a 26.7% GHG emissions reduction from the Baseline vessel using fossil-derived diesel fuel. The Battery Hybrid vessel with 100% renewable electricity combined with diesel fuel provides a 6.9% reduction in GHG emissions. Similar results are seen for the criteria pollutant emissions. The hybrid vessels are also compared with regard to operational safety. The study reveals that hydrogen fuel-cell technology provides an effective hybrid supplement to diesel power for a coastal/local research vessel. Â© 2021

AB  - In the traditional diesel engine propulsion mode, the ships face up to a serial of issues, such as the inefficient performance of marine main engine under low load, the high fuel consumption rate and inferior combustion quality, which hinder the income increase and the pollution decrease. Dieselelectric hybrid propulsion ships can effectively reduce fuel consumption and emissions through reasonable power distribution. Moreover, it also has excellent handling performance and low noise. Taking a certain Deep Water Anchor Handling Tug Supply Vessel as the object, the multiobjective genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) was used to optimize the allocation problem of the power system.

TI  - The Seaspoon Wave Energy Converter: performance characterization of different blade geometries
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2017
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper describes the recent development of the innovative wave energy converter for off-shore applications named the Seaspoon. It is a wave energy converter (WEC) that catches the energy content of oceans waves exploiting the circular motion of the water particles perturbed at the free surface by the action of the wind. The paper describes the development and experimental validation of a CFD model, which will be used to optimise the geometry of Seaspoon blades, enabling its future scale-up. Such a model has been developed in the STAR-CCM+ environment. The model has been successfully compared against literature data for wave motion and forces against a static body. Then, the model has been compared against experimental measurements from the Seaspoon test campaign equipped with flat blades in a laboratory-scale wave tank, showing acceptable results in the prediction of the Seaspoon motion. Furthermore, experimental results on concave-type and convex-type blades are shown, demonstrating that the latter is the most promising shape: such blade type is currently object of CFD model validation and will be considered for the future development of the Seaspoon. The test campaign and the simulation studies contributed to identify the geometrical options to enhance the Seaspoon energy harvesting efficiency as well as adaptability to different sea-states.

TI  - Wind/wave misalignment effects on mooring line tensions for a spar buoy wind turbine
JO  - Proceedings Of The International Conference On Offshore Mechanics And Arctic Engineering - Omae
PY  - 2018
VL  - 1
IS  - NA
AB  - The design methodology for mooring systems for a spar buoy wind turbine considers the influence of extreme events and wind/wave misalignments occurring in its lifetime. Therefore, the variety of wind and wave directions affects over the seakeeping and as a result the evaluation of the maxima loads acting on the spar-buoy wind turbine. In the present paper, the importance of wind/wave misalignments on the dynamic response of spar-type floating wind turbine [1] is investigated. Based on standards, International Electrotechnical Commission IEC and Det Norske Veritas DNV the design of position moorings should be carried out under extreme wind/wave loads, taking into account their misalignments with respect to the structure. In particular, DNV standard, in 'Position mooring' recommendations, specifies in the load cases definition, if site specific data is not available, to consider non-collinear environment to have wave towards the unit's bow (0Â°) and wind 30Â° relative to the waves. In IEC standards, the misalignment of the wind and wave directions shall be considered to design offshore wind turbines and calculate the loads acting on the support structure. Ultimate Limit State (ULS) analyses of the OC3-Hywind spar buoy wind turbine are conducted through FAST code, a certified nonlinear aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation tool by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's). This software was developed for use in the International Energy Agency (IEA) Offshore Code Comparison Collaborative (OC3) project, and supports NREL's offshore 5-MW baseline turbine. In order to assess the effects of misaligned wind and wave, different wind directions are chosen, maintaining the wave loads perpendicular to the structure. Stochastic, full-fields, turbulence simulator Turbsim is used to simulate the 1-h turbulent wind field. The scope of the work is to investigate the effects of wind/wave misalignments on the station-keeping system of spar buoy wind turbine. Results are presented in terms of global maxima determined through mean up-crossing with moving average, which, then, are modelled by a Weibull distribution. Finally, extreme values are estimated depending on global maxima and fitted on Gumbel distribution. The Most Probable Maximum value of mooring line tensions is found to be influenced by the wind/wave misalignments. The present paper is organized as follows. Section 'Introduction', based on a literature study, gives useful information on the previous studies conducted on the wind/wave misalignments effects of floating offshore wind turbines. Section 'Methodology' describes the applied methodology and presents the spar buoy wind turbine, the used numerical model and the selected environmental conditions. Results and the corresponding discussion are given in Section 'Results and discussion' for each load case corresponding to the codirectional and misaligned wind and wave loads. Results are presented and discussed in time and frequency domains. Finally, in Section 'Conclusion' some conclusions are drawn. Copyright Â© 2018 ASME.

JO  - Energy
PY  - 2018
VL  - 154
IS  - NA
AB  - The platform pitching motion of the Offshore Floating Wind Turbine (OFWT) introduces an additional wind profile to the rotor, which may significantly impact the power performance of the OFWT. In this paper, the power performance of an OFWT in platform pitching motion is investigated using the Free Vortex Method (FVM). Firstly, the pitching and non-pitching cases are compared. Then, the power performance of the OFWT in pitching motions with different amplitudes and frequencies is investigated at the design point (tip speed ratio Î» = 7). Afterwards, the reduced frequency k is proposed to integrate the influences of the platform pitching amplitude and frequency. The power performance curves of the pitching OFWT are derived as functions of Î» and k in the whole operating region. Results show that as k increases, the mean power output decreases at low Î» but increases at high Î». The mean power coefficient declines with the increase of k. The power variation increases with the increases of Î» and k. To make up the loss of the mean power coefficient and to mitigate the side effects resulted from the power variation, advanced control strategies and platforms with good motion performances should be developed for OFWTs.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and European Union (EU) have set targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Focusing on ships above 5000 GT, their measures exclude several ship types, such as fishing vessels, offshore ships, and yachts. However, smaller ships generate 15-20\% of the total GHG emissions. Multiple potential fuel alternatives are already in use or have been investigated to minimize carbon emissions for coastal ferries. This study evaluates the possibility of using alternative fuels for small ferries by seven different parameters: technical readiness, presence of regulations, GHG emission reduction effectiveness (with two different criteria), capital expenditure (Capex), operating expenditure (Opex), and ice navigation ability. The assessment is based on an evaluation of state-of-the-art literature as well as second-hand statistics and press releases. The study also reports the most recent implementations in each alternative technology area. As a result, it was found that although there are several measures with high potential for the future, the most feasible fuel alternatives for coastal ferries would be fully electric or diesel-electric hybrid solutions.

VL  - 13

AB  - Tidal as renewable energy is increasingly utilised for power generation in many countries. Integration of tidal plants into the power system requires considering the intermittent nature of the generated power caused by variable tide levels. Thus, the reliability studies of power systems including high tidal generation affected by the uncertain nature resulting from the variable water levels are investigated. The reliability model of a tidal power plant on a barrage is proposed. In the proposed model, the failure rates of the composed components (especially the hydro pump and gate) and the effect of tidal height variation on the components failure rate are considered. Also, the reliability model with numerous states resulting from the variability of the generated power through the fuzzy C-means clustering technique and Xie-Beni index is reduced to a multi-state reliability model. The resulting reliability model is utilised for the generation adequacy studies of a power system containing large-scale tidal power plants. Moreover, different reliability indices are calculated for future generation expansion planning. The proposed technique is applied to the two-test systems, and sensitivity analysis is performed. Besides, the effects of the hydro pump, maintenance, ageing of the components and peak load are investigated.

JO  - International Journal Of Greenhouse Gas Control

VL  - 3

AB  - We sketch four possible pathways how carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) (r)evolution may occur in the Netherlands, after which the implications in terms of CO2 stored and avoided, costs and infrastructural requirements are quantified. CCS may play a significant role in decarbonising the Dutch energy and industrial sector, which currently emits nearly 100 Mt CO2/year. We found that 15 Mt CO2 could be avoided annually by 2020, provided some of the larger gas fields that become available the coming decade could be used for CO2 storage. Halfway this century, the mitigation potential of CCS in the power sector, industry and transport fuel production is estimated at maximally 80-110 Mt CO2/year, of which 6080 Mt CO2/year may be avoided at costs between 15 and 40 (sic)/t CO2, including transport and storage. Avoiding 30-60 Mt CO2/year by means of CCS is considered realistic given the storage potential represented by Dutch gas fields, although it requires planning to assure that domestic storage capacity could be used for CO2 storage. In an aggressive climate policy, avoiding another 50 Mt CO2/year may be possible provided that nearly all capture opportunities that occur are taken. Storing such large amounts Of CO2 would only be possible if the Groningen gas field or large reservoirs in the British or Norwegian part of the North Sea will become available. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sea level variability in the Swedish Exclusive Economic Zone and adjacent seawaters: Influence on a point absorbing wave energy converter
JO  - Ocean Science
PY  - 2019
VL  - 15
IS  - 6
AB  - Low-frequency sea level variability can be a critical factor for several wave energy converter (WEC) systems, for instance, linear systems with a limited stroke length. Consequently, when investigating suitable areas for deployment of those WEC systems, sea level variability should be taken into account. In order to facilitate wave energy developers finding the most suitable areas for wave energy park installations, this paper describes a study that gives them additional information by exploring the annual and monthly variability of the sea level in the Baltic Sea and adjacent seawaters, with a focus on the Swedish Exclusive Economic Zone. Overall, 10 years of reanalysis data from the Copernicus project have been used to conduct this investigation. The results are presented by means of maps showing the maximum range and the standard deviation of the sea level with a horizontal spatial resolution of about 1&thinsp;km. A case study illustrates how the results can be used by the WEC developers to limit the energy absorption loss of their devices due to sea level variation. Depending on the WEC technology one wants to examine, the results lead to different conclusions. For the Uppsala point absorber L12 and the sea state considered in the case study, the most suitable sites where to deploy WEC parks from a sea level variation viewpoint are found in the Gotland basins and in the Bothnian Sea, where the energy loss due to sea level variations is negligible.
