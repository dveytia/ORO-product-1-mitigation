AB  - The utilization of renewable energy is required immediately since emissions of carbon dioxide are being restricted. To this end, we are investigating the ocean wave energy converter, especially the floating OWC "Backward Bent Duct Buoy" (BBDB). The BBDB, proposed by Masuda in 1986, is a wave energy converter of the 'moored floating oscillating water column' type that is composed of an air chamber, an L-shaped bent duct, a buoyancy chamber, and a turbine. The BBDB has certain positive characteristics. Firstly, the primary conversion performance of the BBDB is better than other floating OWCs. Secondly, the length of the BBDB is shorter than other floating OWCs. Thirdly, as the BBDB advances in the incident wave direction with slow speed waves because of the negative wave drift force, the mooring cost can be reduced. In this research, experiments under a various wave periods were carried out to clarify the characteristics and cause of the generation of negative drift force acting on a BBDB in regular waves with a two-dimensional wave tank at Saga University. The length of the BBDB model is 85cm. To measure the wave drift force, the model is moored with horizontal wire-springs. The motions of the BBDB, such as surge, heave, and pitch, are measured by remotely using image processing. The fluid velocity around the BBDB is measured by using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Motion tests of the BBDB without mooring are also carried out to measure the horizontal velocity of the BBDB in waves. From the experimental results, the characteristics and causes of the generation of negative drift force acting on the BBDB in regular waves are discussed. Copyright Â© 2008 by ASME.

AB  - Designing highly stressed offshore renewable energy composite structures (e.g. wind and tidal turbine blades) necessitates characterisation of woven fabric composite under off axial loading. In this work a combined method of finite element analysis, digital image correlation and microscopy is used to assess the effect of ply orientation on the tensile/shear properties and failure modes of woven glass fibre reinforced polymer composites. Full field strain maps obtained by the digital image correlation method were used to evaluate the damage development and the inhomogeneity of strain localisation. The development of finite element models of mechanical test specimens is based on the analysis of micro-mechanical models of representative volume elements using a homogenisation technique in order to calculate the effective orthotropic properties. The agreement between numerically and experimentally calculated strains obtained in the elastic regimes indicates that stress analysis conducted by numerical methods is useful when characterising the effect of ply orientation on mechanical behaviour. Strain measurement conducted by the digital image correlation method indicated that there is a strong relationship between the strain distribution and the microstructure/ply orientation. In addition, it was found that the levels of localised tensile strain are higher than the global strain indicating the structural heterogeneity of the composite material. Finally, microstructural analysis of tension and shear test specimens showed that the main failure modes are de-bonded fibres, fibre pull out, in-plane/inter-laminar shear cracks and delamination.

AB  - With increasing interest in feed-based methane mitigation strategies and regional legal directives aimed at methane production from the agricultural sector, identifying local sources of biological feed additives will be critical for rendering these strategies affordable. In a recent study, the red alga Asparagopsis taxiformis harvested offshore Australia was identified as highly effective for reducing methane production from enteric fermentation. Due to potential difference in methane-reduction potential and the financial burden associated with transporting the harvested seaweed over long distances, we examined locally sourced red seaweed A. taxiformis and brown seaweed Zonaria farlowii for their ability to mitigate methane production when added to feed widely used in the Californian dairy industry. At a dose rate of 5\% dry matter (DM), California-sourced A. taxiformis and Z. farlowii reduced methane production by up to 74\% (p < 0.05) and 11\% (p < 0.05) during in vitro rumen fermentation, respectively. No effect on CO2 production was observed for either seaweed. The measured decrease in methane production induced by A. taxiformis and Z. farlowii amendment, suggest that these local macroalgae are indeed promising candidates for biotic methane mitigation strategies in California, the largest milk producing state in the United States. To determine their real potential as methane mitigating feed supplements in the dairy industry, their effect in vivo will need to be investigated.

AB  - Offshore wind farms will play a significant role in the European energy supply of the coming years. Today, one of the main challenges faced by the offshore wind market is to reduce the cost of turbine foundations. The monopod bucket foundation is a possible solution to this problem. The long-term cyclic response of this foundation is not fully understood. In this article, a single gravity physical model is described, an experimental campaign is presented and the observed results are discussed. The aim of the study is to explore the general pattern of response of the foundation under cyclic loading. The bucket is installed in water-saturated dense sand. The experimental rig induces cyclic loading to the foundation in terms of overturning moment and horizontal loading. A number of cyclic loading tests is presented. The loading features (i.e. amplitude and average of the cycles) differ for each test. The discussion of the results focuses on three aspects: a critical cyclic loading configuration is found and compared with a previous study, a limit value of cyclic moment for which no degenerative rotation occurs is obtained and the effect of the loading frequency on the plastic displacement is explored.

TI  - Recovery of Benthic Microalgal Biomass and Community Structure Following Beach Renourishment at Folly Beach, South Carolina
JO  - Estuaries And Coasts
PY  - 2019
VL  - 42
IS  - 1
AB  - One method of preserving beaches against the effects of erosion and sea level rise is beach renourishment. While there have been many studies assessing the impact of renourishment on macrofauna, few studies have looked at its effects on microbes. Benthic microalgae (BMA) are important primary producers, representing the basis of nearshore food webs. BMA also secrete extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which bind sediment and thus help prevent erosion. The objective of this study was to monitor recovery of BMA in terms of relative biomass (estimated as sediment chlorophyll a) and community structure (characterized using high-throughput DNA sequencing) following renourishment of Folly Beach, SC in 2014. We also examined the relationships among biomass, EPS, and erosion. Sediment samples were collected intermittently (n=9) from two renourished and two control sites within three intertidal zones (high, mid, low) from June 2014 to January 2015. Biomass recovered in sequence from low to high intertidal, corresponding to when the artificially-raised beach once again experienced regular tidal inundation (between 93 and 169days post-renourishment). Alpha diversity metrics misleadingly indicated recovery around this same time within the high intertidal, but compositional changes through time were unlike those seen in control samples, and these communities had yet to recover at similar to 7months post-renourishment. Renourishment therefore appears to impact BMA communities via artificial elevation of the beach face. While there were relationships between chl a, EPS, and erosion, BMA most likely play a minimal role in sediment stabilization in high-energy environments like Folly Beach.

TI  - Ocean warming, more than acidification, reduces shell strength in a commercial shellfish species during food limitation
JO  - Plos One
PY  - 2014
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Ocean surface pH levels are predicted to fall by 0.3-0.4 pH units by the end of the century and are likely to coincide with an increase in sea surface temperature of 2-4Â°C. The combined effect of ocean acidification and warming on the functional properties of bivalve shells is largely unknown and of growing concern as the shell provides protection from mechanical and environmental challenges. We examined the effects of near-future pH (ambient pH -0.4 pH units) and warming (ambient temperature +4Â°C) on the shells of the commercially important bivalve, Mytilus edulis when fed for a limited period (4-6 h day-1). After six months exposure, warming, but not acidification, significantly reduced shell strength determined as reductions in the maximum load endured by the shells. However, acidification resulted in a reduction in shell flex before failure. Reductions in shell strength with warming could not be explained by alterations in morphology, or shell composition but were accompanied by reductions in shell surface area, and by a fall in whole-body condition index. It appears that warming has an indirect effect on shell strength by re-allocating energy from shell formation to support temperature-related increases in maintenance costs, especially as food supply was limited and the mussels were probably relying on internal energy reserves. The maintenance of shell strength despite seawater acidification suggests that biomineralisation processes are unaffected by the associated changes in CaCO3 saturation levels. We conclude that under near-future climate change conditions, ocean warming will pose a greater risk to shell integrity in M. edulis than ocean acidification when food availability is limited.

IS  - NA
AB  - The Transportation Development Centre of Transport Canada, in collaboration with Environment Canada's Emissions Research and Measurement Division, conducted a series of emissions tests onboard the Oceanex RoRo vessel MV Cabot operating between Montreal, Quebec, and St. John's, Newfoundland. The primary objectives were to verify emissions inventories and demonstrate the feasibility of installing affordable emissions reduction technology on marine vessels as well as compliance with future regulatory emissions limits. The tests also provided an opportunity for Canada to share information on emissions program and technology developments with U.S. regulatory authorities. This may lead to developing joint emissions reduction initiatives for existing marine vessels. This paper describes the field-testing of a water injection system (WIS) to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from ocean-going vessels. Tests were conducted on a semi-dedicated basis during voyage and under steady-state conditions. The emissions measurements were taken in accordance with ISO 8178-4-E3 protocol and using both marine diesel oil and intermediate fuel oil, which enabled the evaluation of the impact of different fuel type and quality on emissions. An initial series of tests was carried out on the MV Cabot in March 2004, followed by a second series of tests on the same vessel in March 2005. These tests demonstrated the effectiveness of a low-cost WIS for reducing NOx emissions in marine diesel engines. They also showed that water injection reduces NOx at the expense of an increase in both particulate matter and carbon monoxide when using intermediate fuel oil. NOx reductions varied between 10 and 35 percent, and were most effective at high water injection ratios above 50 percent engine load. The test results showed no negative impact of the WIS on fuel consumption or engine operation and performance. This paper compares the results obtained from the consecutive series of tests in terms of the effectiveness of NOx reduction, and analyses the results in the context of other full-scale test results obtained from emissions control system vendors and engine suppliers. It also investigates the theoretical process and technology of water injection through charge air fumigation, and both direct water and fuel/water emulsion injection. In addition, the effects of water injection on engine emissions, operation and maintenance, and the optimization of water injection from a knowledge-based perspective are discussed. Further testing and development of the WIS are required to realize optimal emissions reduction potential and to determine the impact of water injection on fuel consumption, and engine operational performance as well as the impact of fuel quality on emissions.

AB  - As the scale of wind farm continues to increase, the internal stability of wind farms and the distribution control strategy of wind turbines need to be further studied. Modeling is the basis of stability analysis. In order to solve the modeling problem, this paper proposes a wind farm modeling method based on vector variables. The core idea is to convert the complex model that contains plenty of wind generation units to a model consisting of one typical submodule, by constructing the block vector formed variables. In this way, the model has good scalability and high simulation efficiency, and can be realized by the vector simulation function of MATLAB/Simulink. In addition, linearization results can be easily and directly obtained by using Linearization Toolbox in Simulink, thus avoiding the complexity of writing programs for linearization calculations when studying the stability of large systems. Then, the simulation results are compared with the electromagnetic transient model to verify the correctness of the model. Time-domain simulation and linearization results verify the effectiveness of the method. Â© 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The National Maritime Research Institute of Japan (NMRI) has developed an Eco-Shipping Support System for domestic coastal shipping to provide energy saving navigation route and just-in-time speed plan. The operations by these services using weather routing are becoming a popular method combined with the rising fuel price. Accordingly, many simulation-based studies have been accomplished for comparative analysis. However, shipping company attempt to evaluate the effects of these operations based on actual data. The NMRI has developed methodologies to evaluate the amount of GHG emission reductions by using the speed plan services. One is based on Energy Efficiency Navigational Indicator (EENI), which is proposed to evaluate both loaded and unloaded conditions, in different size and speed of ships. The other is the estimate of operational performances of ship by using monitoring data. This paper presents applicability of these estimation methodologies to actual ships. Consequently,effectiveness and practical applicability was confirmed. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis Group

AB  - The aim of 40\% CO2 emission reduction by 2030 of the shipping industry has been adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) and Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) has become mandatory and served as a guidance for companies in low carbon shipping (LCS). However, the proactive implementation of LCS measures by stakeholders is still undeniably playing a decisive role. Unfortunately, a knowledge gap remains as the manner by which decisions regarding the selection and application of LCS measures can be made appropriately considering multiple criteria. In this paper, we analyze the primary internal and external factors influencing the LCS decisions and propose a problem - solving framework for shipping companies in choosing the most suitable LCS measures for individual ships to implement in diversified conditions. The framework has a generic structure thus researchers, policy makers, and decision-makers can apply it flexibly and diversely.

AB  - The Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (MRCSP) is conducting large-scale CO2 injection into carbonate reefs in northern Lower Michigan, using CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) fields as test beds for understanding geoscience issues and developing best practices. Depleted oil and gas fields are of regional importance as they are increasingly seen as a significant opportunity for geologic storage in Midwestern USA. The demonstration and concurrent technology transfer are aimed at promoting this early deployment option for carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS). Three types of reef are being evaluated: late stage reefs that have already undergone significant CO2-EOR, active stage reefs with ongoing CO2-EOR, and newly targeted reefs that are in primary production. Initial modeling and monitoring results, as well as feasibility assessments of using technologies such as tracer studies, vertical seismic profiling, microseismic monitoring, borehole gravity survey, and remote sensing, are guiding the design of the long-term monitoring, verification, and accounting (MVA) program.

AB  - Wind power generation is one of the most effective ways to solve the electric power supply in islands. This paper presents a simple, reliable, and effective power regulating device for small-scale island wind turbine, especially for the turbine's protection during strong winds. The regulator consists of a rigid tail with an electrical control rotating an aerodynamic vane to yaw the rotor edgewise to the wind direction during high wind speeds, an electric linear actuator, and a controller. Compared with the conventional mechanical vane applied in small-scale wind turbines, such a device possesses several advantages of simple structure, high controllability, and increased reliability. The implementation of rotating the vane actively only depends on the generator speed by measuring AC electrical frequency and the output power by measuring two DC electrical quantities, and no mechanical sensors are needed. The regulator has been applied to a 15-kW prototype operating on an island for more than three years. Field test results indicate that the regulator can effectively turn the rotor out of the wind direction and its behavior agrees well with simulations. Such means of power regulating for small-scale wind turbines can be advantageously utilized compared to other mechanical or electromechanical methods.

AB  - This study highlights that in addition to using ammonia in the maritime sector and integrating it into the ship concept, it is a challenging option for shipowners in terms of capital and operational expenditures. In this study, the typical marine-type fuels used in the main engines of a bulk carrier were compared to ammonia in a Techno-Economic Analysis. The bulk carrier features a conventional main engine system, and operational data was acquired to determine how much ammonia was consumed. The ship is classified using the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII). To determine its economic viability, Monte-Carlo Simulation is utilized. In addition, a cost scenario for in-service bulk carriers was developed, with an emphasis on their application. Ammonia is used to minimize petroleum consumption, but it is not cost-effective for long-term financial sustainability, and the installation cost is more than 5 million USD. MAC calculation was made according to NPV values and CO2 reduction results and 3816.42 $/tCO2e was obtained. According to the article, ammonia is more suitable for newly built marine vessels. With the study, a method that can be used in the feasibility studies of different alternative technologies for the existing ships of the shipping companies is presented in the literature. Â© 2022

AB  - IMO has introduced regulations to improve fuel quality in the sector to reduce emissions from ships carrying the vast majority of world trade. As a result of these regulations, which were planned gradually, carbon-neutral shipping was targeted. In line with this goal, it was seen that ship operating companies tend to various alternatives to increase fuel quality. This study evaluated various fuel alternatives for ship investment decisions by employing the Technique for Order Preference By Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method under the Single Valued Neutrosophic Sets (SVNS) in terms of sustainability aspects. First, criteria that are specific to the ship investment decision under the aspects of sustainability and their weights were determined. Then, these weights were placed in the model to determine the most sustainable ship fuel produced within the scope of the study. Finally, alternatives determined in terms of fuel type, which is one of the items to be decided on ship investment, were listed according to their degree of sustainability. According to the findings, dual fuel and bio-fuel were selected as more sustainable bunker fuels for today. Technically, findings were evaluated, and the pros and cons of the related bunker fuels were revealed. In the light of the findings, evaluations were made on alternatives.

AB  - Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas because it transmits visible light but absorbs strongly in the infrared. Carbon dioxide is mainly generated from the combustion of fossil fuels or vegetable matter, among other industrial processes such as cement production and ammonia plants. CO2 emitted from burning fossil fuels is believed to be a major contributor to the amount of CO2 levels in the atmosphere contributing to global warming. Hydrate technology can be used to capture CO2 gas in the form of hydrates. In this technology CO2 and water are combined at certain conditions of temperatures and pressures to form of a hydrate, and then transported and released at great depths into the ocean. Disposal of CO2 in the form of hydrates in the sea is a great potential as the ocean is vast and occupies 70% of the earthC"s surface. Numerous power plants and petrochemical plants are located near the coastline and hence there is easy access to the ocean. The CO2 hydrate formation as a CO2 disposal method may potentially offer significant savings in CO2 disposal because of minimal cost of CO2 capture. This paper proposes a work flow for disposing of CO2. The model describes the sequence of operations for CO2 capture and disposal using CO2 hydrate. A typical example would be used to describe the workflow from CO2 emitted to CO2 hydrate disposal. CO2 hydrate is denser than seawater and therefore CO2 hydrate deposited in the ocean will sink to the seabed as long as the disposal site is within the hydrate formation envelope.

AB  - The benefits of gas as a fuel for ships are presented. At present, LNG is the cleanest fuel available for ships, eliminating all SOx emissions, reducing NOx emissions by 80% and CO2 emissions by 20%. There are three aspects why everyone is not burning it, i.e., technical, logistic, and economic. Norway has the LNG to deliver as bunkers and it has the desire to cut both air pollution and marine pollution risk. The move away from steam turbines powered by boil off gas to diesel engines on LNG carriers is the biggest step for a long time. Today, many new LNG carriers on order will be powered either by boil off gas driving a diesel electric installation, with dual fuel arrangements for the passage with no gas on board, or large two-stroke diesel engines burning conventional fuel, with the boil of reliquefied on board.

AB  - Soil from primary/natural and artificially generated mangrove forests from Lamongan, Indonesia, was analyzed for bulk density, carbon content and nitrogen content. Samplings were carried out at a total of 12 stations and up to 1 m depth (0-10, 10-25, 25-40, 40-70 and 70-100 cm). Organic matter contents were analyzed using loss-on-ignition and values were converted to organic carbon content using an accepted conversion factor of 0.58. The results showed that the primary forest had lower bulk density and higher carbon and nitrogen contents than those of the artificial forest. On average, the bulk densities of natural and artificial forests were 0.73 g cm-3 and 0.96 g cm-3 respectively, while carbon contents were 6.39% and 3.67% respectively. Carbon and nitrogen stocks of the primary forest were 477.82Â±70.75 MgC ha-1 and 38.91Â±22.84 MgN ha-1respectively while they were lower at the artificial forest (363.54Â±52.66 MgC ha-1 and 11.75Â±2.54 MgN ha-1 respectively). Higher carbon content on the natural forest significantly contributes to higher amount of carbon stocks in the forest. Carbon/nitrogen ratios were 21 and 31 for primary and artificial mangrove forests respectively. Marine based carbon pools might also play a role in the primary mangrove forest as it had lower carbon/nitrogen ratios. Â© 2018, World Research Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion and land use change will lead to disastrous global warming in the near future, so it is widely recognised as one of the most challenges facing human societies. In this paper, we will assess the atmospheric carbon dioxide removal and recycling utilisation which can turn anthropogenic carbon emissions from carbon pollution into valuable resource and then satisfy the needs of sustainable development goals (SDGs). The direct removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide is mainly through direct air capture, sustainable biochar, desert geoengineering, and ocean fertilisation. Captured atmospheric carbon dioxide can further be utilised in the synthesis of various fuels or enhance of traditional energy production. This novel approach can bring the atmospheric carbon dioxide back to the energy cycle, converse fossil energy into carbon-neutral energy, and then achieve the recycle of carbon dioxide resource.

AB  - Hawaii is the state most vulnerable to dislocation in the global energy market, with more than 91% of its total energy coming into the state as imported oilâ€”two thirds of which is foreign crude. This near-total dependence on seaborne petroleum is a paradox, since Hawaii has a wide variety of renewable energy resources which can serve as alternatives to oil. These renewable resources have the potential of being less polluting than conventional energy supplies and so are consistent with Hawaii's concern for the quality of life. For the past decade Hawaii has been engaged in a comprehensive program of resource assessment, research, development, demonstration, and commercialization of its indigenous energy resources: direct solar, wind, biomass, ocean thermal, geothermal. Sufficient progress has been made to date with a number of these energy alternatives, so that Hawaii should be able to maintain its momentum toward achieving energy self-sufficiencyâ€”even in the face of drastic reductions in federal support for renewable energy RD&D and the present declining cost of oil.

TI  - A review of emissions reduction technologies for low and medium speed marine Diesel engines and their potential for waste heat recovery
JO  - Energy Conversion And Management

VL  - 207
IS  - NA
AB  - Reducing emissions from internal combustion engines is becoming one of the most important tasks for engine manufactures and transport regulatory organizations. In particular, the marine transportation sector is one of the most polluting, due to the intense maritime activity and the use of low-quality fuels, burned in Heavy Duty Diesel Engines, for ship propulsion and auxiliary power generation. In order to reduce the global shipping environmental impact, the IMO (International Maritime Organization) is restricting NO and SO ships' emissions through the introduction of the IMO Tier III legislation, which requires to consider a wide spectrum of emissions reduction technologies and strategies, which are going to have an impact on the engine performance and fuel consumption. In this work, the main solutions being currently developed or adopted for low and medium speed Diesel engines have been reviewed from a qualitative, and sometimes quantitative, point of view, but, in comparison to previous literature, focusing more on their potential with respect to possible waste heat recovery systems utilization, such as, in particular, steam Rankine cycles and Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC). Indeed, even though many of the considered emissions mitigation technologies lead to a certain amount of penalty in fuel economy, the use of waste heat recovery systems to recover wasted engines energy could become interesting in order to develop more efficient but, at the same time, cleaner engines.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 133
IS  - 2
AB  - One of the main goals in the marine industry is to reduce the impact of CO2 emissions from ships in order to meet stricter IMO greenhouse emission requirements. Two CO2 indexes came into force on 1 January 2013: Energy Efficiency Design index (EEDI) to evaluate the engine and vessel design and measure the gCO2 emissions per ton per mile, and Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) to guide the operator in developing the best practice on board ships. By 2025, all new ships will be a massive 30\% more energy efficient than those built in 2014. This research aims to go over the feasible options available to ship owners to meet the EEDI requirements and determine the more effective option from the viewpoint of technicality and adoptability issues. As a case study, one of VLCC Tanker ships has been investigated regarding this concept. The outcomes prove both ship steaming and waste heat recovery concepts are considered to be the most preferred options. The results reveal that reducing ship speed by 10\% and 20\% will reduce CO2 emissions by 30\% and 54\%, respectively, and the attained EEDI values will be improved by 11\% and 34\%, respectively. Moreover, the paper presents a combination between steam and power turbine generators as a waste heat recovery concept, which has the ability to generate 2799 kW with an improvement of EEDI by 10.05\% and 9.04\%, at 100\% and 80 \% of ship's power, respectively.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The offshore wind energy development is highly affected by the condition of the weather at sea. Hence, it demands a well-organized planning of the overall process starting from the producersâ€™ sites until the offshore site where the turbines will finally be installed. The planning phase can be supported with the help of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) where weather restrictions, distance matrix, vessel characteristics and assembly scenarios are taken into account. The purpose of this paper is to simulate the overall transport, assembly and installation of the wind turbine components at sea. The analysis is carried out through DES considering both the real historical weather data (wind speed and wave height) and probabilistic approach. Results of the study, applied to the real Offshore Wind Farm (OWF) configuration, are showing a good agreement between the two proposed models. The results point out that the probabilistic approach is highly affected by the semi-random numbers used to model the stochastic behavior of the input variable so that several iterations (200 to 400) are required to reach the convergence of the simulation outputs. We suggest that seasonality of the outputs of both models are preserved, i.e. the variation of the results depending on the variation of the weather along the year. These findings provide a new framework to address risks and uncertainties in OWF installations. Â© SNAME 5th World Maritime Technology Conference, WMTC 2015. All rights reserved.

JO  - Fuel
PY  - 2020
VL  - 279
IS  - NA
AB  - Marine diesel engines, which provide main power source for ships, mainly contribute to air pollution in ports and coastal areas. Thus there is an increasing demand on tightening the emission standards for marine diesel engines, which necessitates the research on various emission reduction strategies. This review covers emission regulations and emission factors (EFs), environmental effects and available emission reduction solutions for marine diesel engines. Not only the establishment of the emission control areas (ECAs) in the regulations but also many experiments show high concerns about the sulfur limits in fuels, sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. Research results reveal that NOx emissions from marine diesel engines account for 50% of total NOx in harbors and coastal regions. Sulfur content in fuel oil is an important parameter index that determines the development direction of emission control technologies. Despites some issues, biodiesel, methanol and liquefied nature gas (LNG) play their important roles in reducing emissions as well as in replacing fossil energy, being promising fuels for marine diesel engines. Fuel-water emulsion (FWE) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) are effective treatment option for NOx emissions control. Common rail fuel injection is an effective fuel injection strategy to achieve simultaneous reductions in particulate matter (PM) and NOx. Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and wet scrubbing are the most mature and effective exhaust aftertreatment methods for marine diesel engines, which show 90% De-NOx efficiency and 95% De-SOx efficiency. It can be concluded that the integrated multi-pollutant treatment for ship emissions holds great promise. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

These challenges are reflected within the investment scheme of RWE group and the new build program of RWE Power in Germany and continental Europe. Beside the erection of modern coal fired plants with CCS option and doubling the CO 2-free capacity based on nuclear and renewable plants (mainly offshore wind) RWE strives to increase Europe's gas-fired generation with low CO2 emissions. Using state of the art gas turbine technology allows to achieve very high efficiencies in base load as well as flexible generation in the medium and peak load market segments. Among the classic multishaft or singleshaft CCGT various topping gas turbine concepts have been realised succesfully by RWE Power.

AB  - Disposal of liquid, anthropogenic CO2 in intermediate-depth ocean waters has been accepted as a means to reduce atmospheric concentrations of this greenhouse species and mitigate global warming. Since the CO2-seawater system is hydrodynamically unstable, liquid CO2 effluent in the ocean will break up into droplets. This paper discusses the influence of both the discharge orifice and properties of CO2 and seawater on the size of CO2 droplets produced. It is found that the droplet size is affected strongly by disposal depth. This suggests that determination of the behavior of CO2 discharged in the ocean must consider not only the orifice configuration, but also fluid properties at the disposal site.

AB  - Stricter environmental legislation for Emission Control Areas (ECAs) prompted a shift towards alternative fuels in the shipping industry over the past year. This development will continue in 2020, with the introduction of the 0.5% sulphur regulations in European waters and the worldwide sulphur cap expected to enter into force by 2025 at the latest. The results from the Paris meeting on climate change in late 2015 may also result in a greater focus on C02 emissions from shipping. By 2030 the maritime industry could therefore also face restrictions on C02 emissions. With the technology available and the regulatory framework in place, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is the most promising alternative fuel option. Currently, there are 75 LNG fuelled ships in operation worldwide (not including the LNG carriers), with another 84 confirmed newbuildings on order. While most of the current projects are relatively small vessels, LNG has also become an option for ultra large container vessels and bulk carriers. The main markets for LNG technology have moved from Norway to North American waters, the North and the Baltic Sea. However, oil based fuels are still superior regarding energy density, handling, availability and costs. The presentation takes a look at challenges associated with conventional fuels and the possibility of using alternatives like LNG or methanol. The OPEX and CAPEX aspects of the technology, fuel availability and fuel pricing are discussed. To illustrate the potential of LNG technology a look at the "PERFECt ship project" is given.

AB  - Nowadays one of the main goal of International Maritime Organization (IMO) is to reduce pollution by vessels over the world. Due to this they implemented in MARPOL Annex VI the requirements for any gas vessel's emissions which are setting the limits and timelines of compliance. To overcome this problem IMO adopted on 15th July 2011 the commence measures for improving vessel's energy efficiency plan and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). The main strategy of GHG envisages the reduction of international shipping in carbon intensity (reducing CO2 emissions from transport activities on average for international shipping from 40% to 70% by 2050). According to this, growing the problem concerning new opportunities for seafarers. That was managed on example by crewing company Nordic Hamburg at implementation the new trainings.

AB  - According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) strategy whose aim is to reduce the shipping industry's total carbon emissions by 50\% by the year 2050, it is desirable to increase ships energy efficiency to reduce GHG emissions and fuel costs. To do so, a short-term measure is to develop innovative engine control strategies in waves that will reduce ship's GHG emissions. In this study, a mathematical model is developed to assess two engine control strategies: the standard constant rotational speed mode and an innovative constant fuel rack approach. The coupled model is made of a mean value engine, propeller curves and a ship behavior simulator. Emphasis is placed on the presentation of the engine model and references are given for further details on the ship simulator. After verifying the coupling between the engine model and the ship simulator, the fuel consumption is compared, for the two strategies, at the same average speed and for three head regular waves. This paper presents the basics of a further long time research project and shows that coupling ship simulators with engine simulators leads to promising simulation tools for a ship's GHG emissions reduction. Results from a first application case show that the constant fuel rack approach reduces fuel consumption (up to 1.6\%).

AB  - To reduce fuel consumption and lead to a major reduction of pollution from NOx, SOx and CO2, the electric ship propulsion system is one of the most prospective substitutes for conventional ship propulsion systems. In order to spread it, innovative technologies for the improvement of the power transmission are required. The high temperature superconducting technology has the possibility for a drastic reduction of power transmission loss. Recently, electric podded propulsions have become popular for large cruise vessels, icebreakers and chemical tankers because of the flexibility of the equipment arrangement and the stern hull design, and better maneuverability in harbour, etc. In this paper, a 1 MW-class High temperature superconducting (HTS) motor with high efficiency, smaller size and simple structure, which is designed and manufactured for podded propulsion, is reported. For the case of a coastal ship driven by the optimized podded propulsion in which the 1MW HTS motor is equipped, the reductions of fluid dynamic resistance and power transmission losses are demonstrated. The present research \& development has been supported by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

AB  - Invasive plants have long been recognized for altering ecosystem properties, but their long-term impacts on ecosystem processes remain largely unknown. In this study, we determined the impact of Egeria densa Planch, a globally invasive freshwater macrophyte, on sedimentation processes in a large tidal freshwater region. We measured carbon accumulation (CARs) and inorganic sedimentation rates in submerged aquatic vegetation SAV dominated by E. densa and compared these rates to those of adjacent tidal freshwater marshes. Study sites were chosen along a range of hydrodynamic conditions in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, USA, where E. densa has been widespread since 1990. Cores were analyzed for bulk density, % inorganic matter, % organic carbon, 210Pb, and 137Cs. Our results show that E. densa patches constitute sinks for both â€œblue carbonâ€ and inorganic sediment. Compared to marshes, E. densa patches have greater inorganic sedimentation rates (E. densa: 1103â€“5989 g mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1, marsh: 393â€“1001 g mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1, p &lt; 0.01) and vertical accretion rates (E. densa: 0.4â€“1.3 cm yrâˆ’1, marsh: 0.3â€“0.5 cm yrâˆ’1, p &lt; 0.05), but similar CARs (E. densa: 59â€“242 g C mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1, marsh: 109â€“169 g C mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1, p &gt; 0.05). Sediment stored by E. densa likely reduces the resilience of adjacent marshes by depleting the sediment available for marsh-building. Because of its harmful traits, E. densa is not a suitable candidate for mitigating carbon pollution; however, currently invaded habitats may already contain a meaningful component of regional carbon budgets. Our results strongly suggest that E. densa patches are sinks for carbon and inorganic sediment throughout its global range, raising questions about how invasive SAV is altering biogeochemical cycling and sediment dynamics across freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Taiwan is located on the Pacific seismic belt, and the soil conditions of Taiwan's offshore wind farms are softer than those in Europe. To ensure safety and stability of the offshore wind turbine supporting structures, it is important to assess the offshore wind farms seismic forces reasonably. In this paper, the relevant seismic and geological data are obtained for Chang-Bin offshore wind farm in Taiwan Strait, the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) is carried out, and the first uniform hazard response spectrum for Chang-Bin offshore wind farm is achieved. Compared with existing design response spectrum in the local regulation, this site-specific seismic hazard analysis has influence on the seismic force considered in the design of supporting structures and therefore affects the cost of the supporting structures. The results show that a site-specific seismic hazard analysis is required for high seismic area. The paper highlights the importance of seismic hazard analysis to assess the offshore wind farms seismic forces. The follow-up recommendations and research directions are given for Taiwan's offshore wind turbine supporting structures under seismic force considerations. Â© 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI.

AB  - Maritime shipping is regarded as the most efficient mode of transport; however, its contribution to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and the health issues related to shipping activity near residential centers cannot be neglected. In recent years, the efforts of regulators, ship operators, and port authorities have led to actions for ship emissions reduction to improve shipping's environmental performance. This work builds on an activity-based methodology that allows the estimation of emissions and examines environmental effects of slow steaming, fuel regulations, near-port speed-reduction schemes, and cold ironing. Pollutant emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and black carbon are modeled. A linear programming model minimizes fuel consumption through speed differentiation on a shipping line's routes based on fuel costs and binding regulations in each segment of the journey. Although the examined emissions-reduction actions may have a positive regional environmental effect by cutting emissions, it is possible that additional emissions are generated elsewhere because of increased sailing speeds beyond regulated areas. Trade-offs between pollutants are observed for reduction actions that may have a positive effect on some emission species but at the same time result in additional particulate matter and black carbon emissions. The presented framework allows key actors to conduct comprehensive studies and design improved emissions reduction actions with fewer negative impacts in other areas.

This encouraged advancing technologies that sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or capture those emitted before entering the carbon cycle. Recently, CO2capture, utilizing porous materials was established as a very favorable route, which has drawn extreme interest from scientists and engineers due to their advantages over the absorption approach. In this review, we summarize developments in porous adsorbents for CO2capture with emphasis on recent studies. Highly efficient porous adsorption materials including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, mesoporous silica, clay, porous carbons, porous organic polymers (POP), and metal oxides (MO) are discussed. Besides, advanced strategies employed to increase the performance of CO2adsorption capacity to overcome their drawbacks have been discoursed. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

AB  - The maritime transportation sector is one of the main contributors to global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM), hazardous air pollutants, NOX and SOX. In particular, it is estimated that the CO2 emissions in this sector are about 1 Gt every year. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted stringent emission limits in its Tier III regulation, most notably on NOX and SOX emissions and pledged to reach a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipments by at least 50% by the year 2050, compared to 2008 emissions. For emission control areas (ECAs) these requirements are particularly strict and will be difficult to meet with traditional diesel engines and bunker fuels. Therefore, ship owners need to adopt solutions to bring emissions within these and other future limits by means of environmentally friendly fuels and high efficiency propulsion technologies. In this context, hydrogen and fuel cells play a crucial role, thanks to their low criteria pollutant and GHG emission. This paper presents a techno-economic feasibility study for replacing the conventional diesel engine powertrain, usually employed in Ro-Pax ferries, with an innovative system based on polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology. The ferry is actually powered by four diesel engines, which deliver a total output of 37.8 MW. The ferry also has two auxiliary engines which give an output of 4.0 MW and also two 2.0 MW bow thrusters for its manoeuvring. The energy analysis has allowed to define the hydrogen consumption for each cruise, as well as the optimal size of the innovative propulsion system. In particular, The PEMFC powertrain is sized at the same maximum power output as the main diesel engine and, thanks to the modular architecture of fuel cells and their flexible performance at partial load, the auxiliary engines are not contemplated. Moreover, in order to identify the best solution in terms of ship's weight and space requirements, two hydrogen storage solutions based on compressed hydrogen technology and liquefied hydrogen technology, have been analyzed and compared. The economic assessment has been carried out by estimating the CAPEX and OPEX for each H2 storage technology by considering short-term, mid-term and long-term scenarios (from 2020 to 2050).

JO  - Water Research

AB  - Wastewater (WW) treatment in anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBR) is considered more sustainable than in aerobic reactors. However, outputs from AnMBR are a mixed methane and carbon dioxide gas stream as well as ammonium- (N) and phosphate- (P) containing waters. Using AnMBR outputs as inputs for photoautotrophic algal cultivation can strip the CO2 while removing N and P from effluent which feed algal biomass generation. Recent advances in algal engineering have generated strains that produce high-value side products concomitant with biomass, although only shown in heavily domesticated, lab-adapted strains. Here, it was investigated whether engineered Chlamydomonas reinhardtii could be grown directly in AnMBR effluent with CO2 concentrations found in AnMBR off-gas. The strain was found to proliferate over bacteria in the non-sterile effluent, consume N and P to levels that meet general discharge or reuse limits, and tolerate cultivation in modelled (extreme) outdoor environmental conditions prevalent along the central Red Sea coast. In addition to âˆ¼2.4 g CDW Lâ€“1 biomass production in 96 h, a high-value heterologous sesquiterpene co-product could be obtained from â€˜milkingâ€™ up to 837 Âµg Lâ€“1 culture in 96 h. This is the first demonstration of a combined bio-process that employs a heavily engineered algal strain to enhance the product generation potentials from AnMBR effluent treatment. This study shows it is possible to convert waste into value through use of engineered algae while also improving wastewater treatment economics through co-product generation. Â© 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - Experimental investigation on NOx and green house gas emissions from a marine auxiliary diesel engine using ultralow sulfur light fuel
JO  - Science Of The Total Environment
PY  - 2016
VL  - 572
IS  - NA
AB  - In recent years, marine auxiliary diesel engine has been widely used to produce electricity in the large ocean-going ship. One of the main technical challenges for ocean-going ship is to reduce pollutant emissions from marine auxiliary diesel engine and to meet the criteria of disposal on ships pollutants of IMO (International Maritime Organization). Different technical changes have been introduced in marine auxiliary diesel engine to apply clean fuels to reduce pollutant emissions. The ultralow sulfur light fuel will be applied in diesel engine for emission reductions in China. This study is aimed to investigate the impact of fuel (ultralow sulfur light fuel) on the combustion characteristic, NOx and green house gas emissions in a marine auxiliary diesel engine, under the 50%â€“90% engine speeds and the 25%â€“100% engine torques. The experimental results show that, in the marine auxiliary diesel engine, the cylinder pressure and peak heat release rate increase slightly with the increase of engine torques, while the ignition advances and combustion duration become longer. With the increases of the engine speed and torque, the fuel consumption decreases significantly, while the temperature of the exhaust manifold increases. The NOx emissions increase significantly with the increases of the engine speed and torque. The NO emission increases with the increases of the engine speed and torque, while the NO2 emission decreases. Meanwhile, the ratio of NO2 and NO is about 1:1 when the diesel engine operated in the low speed and load, while the ratio increases significantly with the increases of engine speed and torque, due to the increase of the cylinder temperature in the diffusive combustion mode. Moreover, the CO2 emission increases with the increases of engine speed and torque by the use of ultralow sulfur light fuel. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

JO  - Energy \& Fuels
PY  - 2014
VL  - 28

AB  - Recent focus on algae biomass as an alternative energy source can be attributed to building pressure for conservation of dwindling fossil fuels and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Both micro- and macroalgae have many advantages over terrestrial plants, including-typically faster growth rates and, therefore, higher rates of carbon fixation. This paper reports the combustion characteristics of a species of microalgae and two species of macroalgae under conditions that are relevant for the large-scale use of biomass for heat and other products. The tested species were Tetraselmis sp. (marine microalgae), Derbersia tenusissima (marine macroalgae), and Oedogonium sp. (freshwater macroalgae). Two variants of Oedogonium were tested. One variant was cultivated using standard additions, and the other variant was starved of essential nutrients. Carbon conversion to CO and CO2 and the release of N as NO were determined for the algae by oxidizing-fixed-bed samples of each alga in air at 800 and 1000 degrees C. The gasification reactivity of the chars was also characterized by gasifying samples of each alga in a thermobalance in pure CO2 (1 atm) at 800 degrees C, following in situ devolatilization of the algal samples. Carbon conversion to CO and CO2 exceeded 84\% for all of the tested algae. Most of the fuel C was released during fuel devolatilization, consistent with the proximate analysis for these fuels. Nitrogen conversions to NO ranged between 6 and 12 g of N/100 g of fuel N for Tetraselmis, 6-9 g of N/100 g of fuel N for Derbersia, and 11-21 g of N/100 g of fuel N for the two Oedogonium variants, with NO emissions occurring mainly during devolatilization, in most cases. Chars produced from samples of macroalgae were much More reactive than the chars from the microalgae, Most likely because of the inhibitory effects on mass transfer caused by the very high ash content of the sample used in the present study. The reactivities of all chars increased at high char conversions.

TI  - AIS-Based Scenario Simulation for the Control and Improvement of Ship Emissions in Ports
JO  - Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering
PY  - 2022
VL  - 10
IS  - 2
AB  - Maritime transport is a major mode of transportation. Over 80\% of international freight is carried by this mode. A port is a hub of ships and freight in maritime transport. Because of growing environmental concerns, how to effectively monitor, control, and improve ship emissions in a port has become a challenge for port administrations. This study combines automatic identification systems (AIS), ship emission estimation model (SEEM), geographic information system (GIS) mapping, and a scenario simulation technique to create a ship emission scenario simulation model (SESSM) for mapping and assessing current ship emissions alongside various ``what-if{''} improvement options in a port area. A case study of the Port of Keelung in Taiwan is used to illustrate and verify the proposed model. In this case, the distribution and density of ship carbon emissions are mapped, with the ship berthing status being identified as the primary source of ship emissions. Meanwhile, nine ``what-if{''} scenarios based on various combinations of speed policies and shore power supplies are simulated and analyzed. The results show that the proposed scenario simulation model is an effective tool to assess various ``what-if{''} emission improvement options and to identify key factors for emission reduction. The effect of shore power supply on carbon emission reduction is significantly greater than speed policies. If investment costs are an issue, a balanced emission improvement option is suggested by combining a new speed policy and 50\% shore power supply.

AB  - Offshore wind power is an important of source renewable energy. As a new technology, the one-step integrated transportation and installation technology of offshore wind power has broader application prospects. In order to ensure stability during the towing process, it is necessary to study the behavior of the wind turbine transportation structure. The numerical model of the specialized transportation vessel was set up by MOSES software. An analysis in the frequency domain and time domain was conducted considering the effects of draft, speed, and wave height on the towing stability of the wind turbine transportation vessel. The results show that the one-step integrated transportation method can ensure stability of the wind turbine during the towing process. Reducing draft, increasing speed, and increasing wave height will reduce the towing stability of the wind turbine. In the practical towing process, the combination of various adverse situations will be avoided.

PY  - 2011
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The concept vessel Triality was developed by DNV during the fall 2010, to demonstrate how the maritime industry may go forward in solving some of the environmental challenges lying ahead. In order to be a success the vessel needed to fulfill three main goals; it needed to be technically feasible, have significantly less emissions to air and sea and be as financially competitive as a conventional VLCC. This paper discusses and shows how the key features of the vessel fulfill these three main goals. The Triality's three main features are; LNG as fuel, no use of ballast water and capture and use of the volatile organic compounds of the cargo (VOC). By utilizing high pressure LNG dual fuel main engines, the vessel maintains the high efficiency of conventional two stroke engines, while at the same time reducing its emissions of CO2, NOx and SOx. By modifying the hull shape and creating a new cargo tank arrangement, the Triality is able to complete is return leg without the use of ballast to submerge its propellers and bow, significantly reducing energy consumption for a round-trip. Finally, the Triality utilizes the cooling energy that comes with the use of LNG as a mean for further increasing the main engines' efficiency and for re-condensation of the cargo vapors. The above features increase the newbuilding cost of the vessel, however due to the reduced fuel costs, the difference in net present value of the Triality compared to a conventional VLCC surmounts 20MUSD.

AB  - Offshore medium-voltage DC (MVDC) wind farm layout can bring many advantages compared to the conventional AC system. The series-connected MVDC system could be implemented using three-phase dual-active-bridge (DAB3) converters with phase-shift modulation. For each wind turbine, a modular system is proposed in this paper where several dual-active-bridge converters are connected in an input-parallel output-series (IPOS) configuration to increase the voltage level of the controlled-rectifier. The DC link output of each wind turbine is the series-connected 3DAB outputs. Moreover, the DC links of several wind turbines are also connected in a series to form the MVDC link. A design procedure for the proposed system is presented. The control of the whole system is discussed including the machine-side, the grid-side, and the DAB3 converter control. The main advantage of the proposed system is the modularity and reduced amount of the required cabling compared to previous systems. Simulation results are presented to verify the proposed DC wind farm at different operating conditions. Â© 2022 IEEE.

JO  - Ieee Journal Of Oceanic Engineering
PY  - 2020
VL  - 45

AB  - An unsteady five-hole probe has been developed for the measurement of turbulent flow in tidal channels. Such measurements are vital for accurate prediction of unsteady loads on tidal turbines. Existing field-based velocimeters are either unable to capture the required range of frequencies or are too expensive to profile the variation of turbulence across a typical tidal power site, and thus the available data is inadequate for turbine design. This work adapts the traditional five-hole wind tunnel probe to achieve a low-cost device with sufficient frequency range for tidal turbine applications. The main issue in the marine environment is that the ambient hydrostatic pressure is much higher than the dynamic pressure. This has been overcome by using novel calibration coefficients and differential transducers. In flume tank tests against laser Doppler velocimeter measurements, the frequency response of the probe has been shown to be sufficient to capture all the frequencies necessary for tidal turbine design.

AB  - Increased levels of global atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and further consequences of climate change derived more research efforts to emphasize the actual role of the ecosystems of higher significance in this task. Mangrove ecosystem received a great interest in the demonstration of its potential to sequester atmospheric CO2. Sampling process from the sediment of mangrove ecosystem extended some 600Â km along the Egyptian western coast of Red Sea, starting from Abu Monquar Island (27.216250Â° N, 33.876288Â° E) at the north near Hurghada to Sharm El-Madfaâ€™a (22.895165Â° N, 35.717757Â° E) near the Egyptianâ€“Sudanese frontiers. This work compares the pure population of Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. and Rhizophora mucronata, Lam. as well as the mixed population of both species. Mean values of dry bulk density (DBD) were 1.2 Â± 0.02, gÂ cmâˆ’3 for pure A. marina, 0.8 Â± 0.06Â gÂ cmâˆ’3 for pure R. mucronata, and 0.7 Â± 0.04Â gÂ cmâˆ’3 for mixed sites.

AB  - The red alga Gracilaria lemaneiformis was cultivated with the scallop Chlamys farreri in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system for 42 h at Sanggou Bay, located in north China. Variation in inorganic carbon in the IMTA system was determined. The experiment included three treatments each with three replicates and three scallop monoculture systems as controls. Scallop density (399.1 +/- A 7.85 g per microcosm) remained the same in all treatments while seaweed density differed. The seaweed density was set at three levels (treatments 1, 2, 3) with thallus wet weights of 125.3 +/- A 4.72 g, 252.3 +/- A 7.50 g, and 378.7 +/- A 6.51 g per microcosm, respectively. This produced bivalve to seaweed wet weight ratios of 1:0.31, 1:0.63, and 1:0.96 for treatments 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In control groups, continuous dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by scallops into the seawater not only caused an ongoing increase in partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), 5.5 times higher than that of natural seawater, but also acidified seawater by 0.8 units after 42 h of culture. However, in all seaweed-scallop groups, the higher the algal density, the more CO2 was absorbed; pCO(2) was lowest in treatment 3. The results suggest that a ratio of bivalve to seaweed less than 1:0.96 may produce an even stronger CO2 sink. Overall, the integrated culture of seaweed and scallop could provide an efficient and environmentally friendly means to reduce CO2 emissions from bivalve mariculture.

AB  - The possibility of locating wind turbines on the seabed can open up a new frontier for wind power as a significant domestic renewable energy source along the western coast of India. Space for much larger projects is available in shallow coastal waters compared to land. To assess wind power potential in the western coast of India, first the bathymetric data are divided into three regions, i.e. 0-10, 10-20 and 20-35 m respectively, suitable for fixed-bottom foundation technology. Next, the wind data of several meteorological stations are collected from WindSat satellite. For a given bathymetry, using the characteristics of wind turbine, calculations are made for estimating average wind speed, wind power density and average output of wind turbine. Results of the preliminary study show that there exists a total available area of 67,622 sq. km (up to a depth of 35 m), suitable for installation of offshore wind turbines. Further, results reveal that within the total effective area, the average annual power generation of 477 and 437 TWh respectively, could be achieved using GE 3.6s and Repower 5M commercial offshore turbines.

JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2022
VL  - 254
IS  - NA
AB  - Current EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index) regulations striving to reduce the installed engine power on new ships for a low EEDI may lead to underpowered ships having insufficient power when operating in adverse sea conditions. In this paper, the operational safety of a low-powered ocean-going cargo ship operating in adverse sea conditions has been investigated using an integrated ship propulsion, manoeuvring and sea state model. The ship propulsion and manoeuvring performance, especially the dynamic engine behaviour, when the ship is sailing in heavy weather and turning into head sea, have been studied. According to the results, the dynamic engine behaviour should be considered when assessing the ship operational safety, as the static engine operating envelope is inadequate for the safety assessment. The impact of PTO/PTI (power-take-off/in) operation and changing propeller pitch on the ship thrust availability in adverse sea conditions have also been investigated. To protect the engine from mechanical and thermal overloading, compressor surge and over-speeding during dynamic ship operations and/or in high sea states, the engine and propeller should be carefully controlled. The paper shows that if in (heavy) adverse weather the propeller pitch can be reduced or if the shaft generator can work as a motor (PTI), more thrust can be developed which can significantly improve the operational safety of the ship.

IS  - 6
AB  - Study objective: End-tidal CO2 (ETCO(2)) measurement can be used to predict death in prehospital cardiac arrest patients with pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Design: A prospective, observational study. Setting: An urban and rural emergency medical services system in northwestern Washington state. Participants: Ninety consecutive victims of prehospital cardiac arrest with PEA. Interventions: Patients were intubated in the field and treated using standard advanced cardiac life support protocols with on-line medical control. In addition, all patients were evaluated using mainstream ETCO(2) monitoring. In this study, a hypothetical decision was made to cease resuscitative efforts based on an ETCO(2) level of 10 mm Hg or less after 20 minutes of advanced cardiac life support. Results: The study included 90 patients (61 were men) with a mean age of 67.6 +/- 13.6 years (range, 27 to 95 years). The initial ETCO(2) averaged 11.7 +/- 6.6 mm Hg in nonsurvivors (range, 5 to 50 mm Hg) and 10.9 +/- 4.9 mm Hg in survivors (range, 5 to 24 mm Hg) (P >.672 {[}NS]). After 20 minutes of advanced cardiac life support, ETCO(2), averaged 3.9 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (range, 0 to 12 mm Hg) in patients in whom the theoretical decision was made to cease field resuscitation. In contrast, survivors' ETCO(2), just before restoration of circulation, averaged 31 +/- 5.3 mm Hg (range, 16 to 35 mm Hg) (P<.0001). Using an ETCO(2) of 10 mm Hg or less as a theoretical threshold to predict death in the field successfully discriminated between the 16 survivors to hospital admission (those that achieved return of spontaneous circulation) and 75 prehospital deaths. Of the 16 survivors to hospital admission, 9 died in the hospital, and 7 were discharged from the hospital alive. In 13 of the 16 survivors, the first evidence of return of spontaneous circulation, before a palpable pulse or blood pressure, was a rising ETCO(2). The logistic-regression parameters for the model are 4.4391 + ETCO(2){*}-0.3624 (P<.0001). Sensitivity was 97.3\%; specificity 100\%; positive predictive value 100\%; and negative predictive value 88.9\%. Conclusion: This study suggests that a low ETCO(2) (10 mm Hg or less) can be used to predict irreversible death in patients with pulseless electrical activity undergoing prehospital advanced cardiac life support. if future studies validate this model, use of ETCO(2) may allow for triage decisions in the field.

AB  - British Wind Energy Association was in the South West to mark the start of a long campaign to champion the emerging wave and tidal power sector, after 25 yr helping to bring wind farms to the UK countryside. Based on comparable European installations, the investment needed to reach the UK government's 10% target of electric power by 2010 is likely to be Â£20-23 billion. With regard to lifecycle terms, wind generators to not reduce the CO2 to any significant degree when the emissions from the complete power supply system are considered. The government is advised to work on other technological means, e.g., CO2 capture with storage and fuel cell application, to promote improvements in energy efficiency and encourage robust methods of saving energy with guaranteed CO2 reduction. However, years of distortion and non-market aligned subsidies have severely curtailed the country's renewable potential.

TI  - Assessment of the impact of fouling on vessel energy efficiency by analyzing ship automation data
JO  - Applied Ocean Research

AB  - Shipbuilding and shipping areas are technically dependent to each other since shipping is the end user in the shipbuilding industry. One of the biggest maritime challenges arose due to regulations about emissions and has begun to be a worldwide concern. The maritime industry has enormous potential in terms of a reduction in energy use and emission supervision, especially with respect to existing ships. The specific challenges to shipping are energy inefficiency and emissions; vessel electrification, where sailing displacements and infrastructures permit; and vessel performance optimization. One of these challenges is addressed in this work: operational improvement in detection of the impact of fouling or opposite hull cleaning which enables greater efficiency and an increase in performance. In this paper, battery hybrid electric ship automation data are analysed using Curve Fitting and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) in order to interpret the impact of fouling on ship energy performance degradation by continuous monitoring. Although this methodology is already used for analysing various time series data, DFA is a novel approach that is first time that applied to a marine based data where fouling contains marine biological properties. Application of these techniques reveal that in only 9 months fouling, performance degradation of case study ferry faced 6% of average speed loss. Â© 2020

TI  - Regulating the safe navigation of energy-efficient ships: A critical review of the finalized IMO guidelines for assessing the minimum propulsion power of ships in adverse conditions
JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2022
VL  - 249
IS  - NA
AB  - This study first reviews the various stages of development of recent International Maritime Organisation (IMO) guidelines for the assessment of the minimum propulsion power for safe navigation of ships in adverse conditions, while complying with the requirements of energy efficiency in the frame of the IMO strategy for Green House Gas (GHG) emission reduction from ship operations. It summarizes the underwent key revisions of the guidelines after their original introduction in 2010 (MEPC 61) referring to key elements in the assessment method, such as the definition of the adversity of the operational conditions and ship's navigation speed, to the variety of methods for the prediction of the added resistance in waves, to the recommended thrust deduction fraction and wake fraction, etc., as outlined in the latest version of the guidelines adopted at IMO-MEPC76 (June 2021). An inconsistency in the recommended alternative methods for the added resistance prediction is demonstrated by the analysis of a series of typical tanker and bulk carrier designs. A minimum propulsion power assessment is conducted for the KVLCC2 standard tanker ship to show the impact of the recommended new guidelines on the ship powering requirement. Lastly, the uncertainties involved in the assessment procedure are discussed. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Maritime shipping is the backbone of global trade, and the ports in which goods are loaded and unloaded are vital assets in assuring the economic viability of regional economies. However, the numbers of large and heavy ships docking in ports can lead to unacceptable levels of local pollution. Even though a moored ship does not need to power its propellers, the diesel engines are typically left running to meet the ship's auxiliary power requirements. These can range from the accommodation of the crew to cooling and other needs of the cargo handling. One alternative to using the ship's own diesel engines is to connect the ship's onboard electricity network to a dockside power supply. The technology behind such connections has been discussed in past issues of ABB Review.1 Although there are several technologies available on the market for emissions reduction, ie, scrubbers, purified fuel and LNG,2 only shore-to-ship power provides absolute emissions reduction from ships at port. The rate of adoption of this solution, however, does not depend on technical and environmental arguments alone, but also on regulative and fiscal incentives.

TI  - The effects of afforestation tree species mixing on soil organic carbon stock, nutrients accumulation, and understory vegetation diversity on reclaimed coastal lands in Eastern China
JO  - Global Ecology And Conservation
PY  - 2021
VL  - 26
IS  - NA
AB  - Establishing mixed-species plantations on the reclaimed coastal lands has become a new paradigm in forest management in China, because it increases the provision of ecosystem services. However, the mixing effects of trees with different identities remain largely understudied. In subtropical China, plantations have been historically dominated by monocultures, the conversion of which to mixed plantations are now required considering the need of sustainable forestry development. In this study, we evaluated the soil carbon sequestration, nutrient accumulation, and understory regeneration of three coastal plan-tations with different compositions established 12 years ago, on a reclaimed area in Eastern China. Plots on two scales (30 m x 20 m for trees and 1 m x 1 m for understory vegetation) were set up to conduct vegetation inventory and soil sampling to compare growth parameters, soil physical and chemical properties, and understory composition. We found that coniferous-mixed forest (CMF) had significantly higher soil available water capacity; both CMF and broadleaved-coniferous mixed forest (B-CMF) had significantly higher soil capillary porosity and soil moisture content at saturation; broadleaved mixed forest (BMF) had a greater soil permeability coefficient. Among soil chemical properties, we observed that CMF had higher soil organic carbon stock and cation exchange capacity in both 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm soil layers. CMF and B-CMF had higher hydrolysable ni-trogen and total potassium in both soil layers; BMF had higher available phosphorus contents. Moreover, B-CMF supported better canopy tree growth and higher understory plant species diversity. Therefore, our results showed that the introduction of broad-leaved trees into the coniferous-dominated plantations established on the reclaimed coastal lands produced significant effects on soil properties and understory species diversity. Thus, our study may facilitate the development of new afforestation regimes to mitigate the po-tential impact of increasing environmental changes by improving our understanding of species composition effects on coastal forest ecosystem functioning.

AB  - The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) continues to be a world leader in advancing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies towards commercialization. The Carbon Storage Program implemented by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Fossil Energy and managed by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is helping to develop technologies that safely and permanently store carbon dioxide (CO2) without adversely impacting natural resources or hindering economic growth. Specifically, the Carbon Storage program is developing and advancing CCS technologies both onshore and offshore that will significantly improve the effectiveness of the technology, reduce the cost of implementation, and be ready for widespread commercial deployment. Since 1997, DOE's Carbon Storage program has significantly expanded the CCS knowledge base in selected technology areas through a diverse portfolio of applied research projects and field demonstrations. The Storage program is comprised of three primary technology components: (1) Core Storage R&amp;D, (2) Storage Infrastructure, and (3) Strategic Program Support. These areas work together to address significant technical challenges in order to meet program goals that support the scale-up and widespread deployment of CCS. Core Storage R&amp;D involves applied laboratory- and pilot-scale research focused on developing new technologies and systems for geologic storage, and encompasses three technology areas: (1) Geologic Storage Technologies and Simulation and Risk Assessment; (2) Monitoring, Verification, Accounting (MVA), and Assessment; and (3) Carbon Use and Reuse. The Storage Infrastructure technology component is comprised of three technology pathways: (1) the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSP) Initiative; (2) Characterization field projects (onshore and offshore); and (3) Fitfor-Purpose projects. All three technology pathways address the opportunities and challenges associated with the range of geologic formations potentially available for large-scale CCS development across the United States. The RCSPs include more than 400 distinct organizations, spanning 43 states and four Canadian provinces. These partnerships form the core of a nationwide network developing the framework needed to validate geologic carbon storage technologies. The RCSPs are actively involved in disseminating research information and public outreach, both domestically and internationally, by integrating research initiatives and lessons learned into Best Practices Manuals that highlight technical and nontechnical lessons learned from these field projects. The RCSPs also play an integral role in providing regional storage data to the National Carbon Sequestration Database and Geographic Information System (NATCARB) that provide an interactive visual representation of CCS potential in the United States. Additionally, the DOE Carbon Storage Atlas provides updates on CO2 storage resources and showcases research being conducted through the RCSP Initiative, with emphasis on large- and small-scale field activities. The Strategic Program Support component promotes an integrated approach to ensure that CCS technologies are costeffective and commercially available. The program relies on research conducted by NETL as part of the national laboratory network to complement the program approach to reducing CO2 emissions. NETL research focuses on fundamental and applied fossil energy R&amp;D, performed by Government engineers and scientists, and offers a venue for participation in collaborative research and provides an evaluation of new technology concepts, products, and materials. CCS and other clean coal technologies can play a critical role in mitigating CO2 emissions while supporting energy security throughout the world. DOE's Carbon Storage program has positioned the United States on a path toward ensuring that the enabling technologies will be available to address the demands of new regulations and impact CCS projects in the 2020-2030 timeframe. Continued U.S. leadership in technology development and future deployment is important to the cultivation of economic rewards and new business opportunities, both domestically and abroad.

JO  - Proceedings Of The Asme Turbo Expo
PY  - 2015
VL  - 3
IS  - NA
AB  - Maritime transportation is a significant contributor to So x, NO xand particle matter emissions, even though it has a quite low CO2 impact. New regulations are being enforced in special areas that limit the amount of emissions from the ships. This fact, together with the high fuel prices, is driving the marine industry towards the improvement of the energy efficiency of current ship engines and the reduction of their energy demand. Although more sophisticated and complex engine designs can improve significantly the efficiency of the energy systems in ships, waste heat recovery arises as the most influent technique for the reduction of the energy consumption. In this sense, it is estimated that around 50% of the total energy from the fuel consumed in a ship is wasted and rejected in fluid and exhaust gas streams. The primary heat sources for waste heat recovery are the engine exhaust and the engine coolant. In this work, we present a study on the integration of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) in an existing ship, for the recovery of the main and auxiliary engines exhaust heat. Experimental data from the operating conditions of the engines on the M/S Birka Stockholm cruise ship were logged during a port-to-port cruise from Stockholm to Mariehamn over a period of time close to one month. The ship has four main engines WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ 5850 kW for propulsion, and four auxiliary engines 2760 kW used for electrical consumers. A number of six load conditions were identified depending on the vessel speed. The speed range from 12-14 knots was considered as the design condition, as it was present during more than 34% of the time. In this study, the average values of the engines exhaust temperatures and mass flow rates, for each load case, were used as inputs for a model of an ORC. The main parameters of the ORC, including working fluid and turbine configuration, were optimized based on the criteria of maximum net power output and compactness of the installation components. Results from the study showed that an ORC with internal regeneration using benzene would yield the greatest average net power output over the operating time. For this situation, the power production of the ORC would represent about 22% of the total electricity consumption on board. These data confirmed the ORC as a feasible and promising technology for the reduction of fuel consumption and CO2emissions of existing ships. Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME.

AB  - Human activity releases approximately 25 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, building up the levels of greenhouse gases that are responsible for global climate change. The world's forests store about 2 or 3 billion tons of that output annually, and the ocean absorbs 7 billion tons. Itis estimated that another 5 to 10 billion tons, as much as 40\% of man-made carbon dioxide, could be removed from the atmosphere and safely stored away. Methods of storage are being researched, for example underground geological storage. Issues of safety and cost and feasibility need to be addressed before the government can push for carbon capture and storage.

AB  - Offshore wind generation is an important trend of global wind power generation. To reduce the cost of energy of offshore wind generation, high-power direct-drive wind turbines are being pursued around the world. With the development of superconductors and related technologies, superconducting (SC) generator offers a possible technological approach to produce large-scale direct-drive wind turbines with a modest cost. A design of a SC wind generator (SCWG) for offshore direct-drive wind turbines is presented in this paper. The proposed SCWG is an electrically-excited synchronous generator with stationary field windings made of low temperature superconductor wires. The electromagnetic design considerations on SCWG are studied. The description on design of copper rotor and SC stator are presented. Several key design technologies including rotor cooling and supporting structure design, SC field winding design, and cryogenic refrigeration system for SC magnets are analyzed. The weight and cost of the proposed SCWG are estimated and compared with that of a permanent magnet wind generator (PMWG) design and several existing similar SCWG designs. It is found that the proposed SCWG is 46\% lighter than the PMWG with the same specifications. Moreover, a rough estimation of material cost of the SCWG is carried out, and comparison analysis of cost is also performed.

JO  - Journal Of Marine Research
PY  - 2017
VL  - 75
IS  - 3
AB  - There are a variety of requirements for future forecasts in relation to optimizing the production of wave energy. Daily forecasts are required to plan maintenance activities and allow power producers to accurately bid on wholesale energy markets, hourly forecasts are needed to warn of impending inclement conditions, possibly placing devices in survival mode, while wave-by-wave forecasts are required to optimize the real-time loading of the device so that maximum power is extracted from the waves over all sea conditions. In addition, related hindcasts over a long time scale may be performed to assess the power production capability of a specific wave site. This paper addresses the full spectrum of the aforementioned wave modeling activities, covering the variety of time scales and detailing modeling methods appropriate to the various time scales, and the causal inputs, where appropriate, which drive these models. Some models are based on a physical description of the system, including bathymetry, for example (e.g., in assessing power production capability), while others simply use measured data to form time series models (e.g., inwave-to-wave forecasting). The paper describes each of the wave forecasting problem domains, details appropriate model structures and how those models are parameterized, and also offers a number of case studies to illustrate each modeling methodology.

AB  - The paper provides an overview of linear generator development and testing experience of three different prototype solutions applicable for small-scale wave energy converters. The research was focused on wave power utilization in the Baltic Sea - basin of relatively low wave energy conditions. Developed technical solutions have been tested for their applicability and efficiency in small scale pilot cases. The presented concepts are based on developed linear generator. The unique arrangement of the pairs of permanent magnets and ferromagnetic cores between them was used in order to achieve better inductive properties of a magnetic field and as result, fewer materials were used and more electric power was generated. The developed engine was assessed against three concepts: (1) engine embedded in the stand-alone device in an almost water isolated floating carrier; (2) attached to a Single Point Mooring Buoy providing an additional source of energy for marine navigation signs; and (3) attached to the sea-wards looking pier in order to provide an illumination. Newly developed technical concept, such as a small-scale, versatile, low-cost and high capacity linear generator, and proposed installation solutions may open opportunities for wave energy utilization also in the regions of low wave energy such as the Baltic Sea.

The SEEMP seeks to improve a ship's energy efficiency through four steps, planning, implementation, monitoring and self evaluation and improvement. These play a critical role in the continuous cycle of improving ship energy management. Also incorporated is the guidance on best practices for fuel efficient operations, optimized ship handling, optimum ballast, optimum propeller, etc. At the time of adopting the new regulations, the MEPC (Marine Environment Protection Committee) approved a work plan that includes the further development of the EEDI framework to cover the ship types and sizes excluded from the current energy efficiency design index (EEDI) requirements. It also includes the finalization of the guidelines for the application of the EEDI, SEEMP, and EEOI.

TI  - Simplified site-screening method for micro tidal current turbines applied in Mozambique
JO  - Renewable Energy
PY  - 2012
VL  - 44
IS  - NA
AB  - A variety of tidal current turbines (TCT) are emerging, the majority focussing on large-scale extraction of renewable energy at global tidal hot-spots. Concurrently, some turbines are small and may be suitable also for micro-scale applications (micro-TCT) in remote areas, such as decentralized electrification in countries where fuel-independent energy systems with high power predictability are particularly important. In shallow waters the force of tidal currents varies considerably over short distances and very site-specific measurements are important for assessment of localization, but are also expensive. For micro-TCT to be of interest site-screening and evaluation must be inexpensive, and low-cost methods are thus required. This study proposes a simplified tidal model that is calibrated to site-specific conditions by short-term observations using lightweight equipment. By measurements comprising down to 8% of the monthly tidal period the potential power output can be estimated, with uncertainty intervals up to Â±20%, for currents applicable for micro-TCT. This site-screening method was tested at five sites in Mozambique where near-shore tidal currents were measured with lightweight current meters. At three of the sites, currents were estimated to exceed 1 m s -1 and power output was calculated based on technical assumptions for a micro-TCT device. Results are discussed from the perspective of micro-TCT development and decentralized remote area electrification. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

IS  - 2178, SI
AB  - The Alderney Race is assumed to have the largest tidal-stream energy potential in the north-western European coastal seas. Interaction of the powerful tidal stream with strong wind, high waves and irregular bathymetry creates hydrodynamic conditions of extreme complexity, with high levels of turbulence. A comprehensive dataset has been created to improve the understanding of physical processes, turbulence, tidal stream and resource variability at the site. The database contains a large amount of oceanographic and meteorological measurements acquired in Alderney Race in 2017-2018. This exceptionally long period of observations (nearly one year) became possible due to modern tools and strategies of data acquisition. The paper presents some significant results from the database analysis. Among many results, we would like to underline the following: (i) a wide range of variability of mean flow and sea state parameters was documented; (ii) exceptionally large values of current velocity (7ms(-1)) and significant wave height (8m) were measured during extreme meteorological conditions; (iii) high-frequency variability of current speed during storm events was also found to be very large, with the standard deviation of velocity reaching 0.3ms(-1) in the bottom boundary layer, and 0.6ms(-1) in the surface layer; and (iv) predominant wind and wave direction relative to the flow impacts the wave height and significantly increases the turbulence kinetic energy of the flow. To our knowledge, this is the largest multi-variable database available on potential tidal energy sites. The results of database analysis can represent a significant advance in environmental conditions and resource characterization and provide advanced information to turbine developers. This article is part of the theme issue `New insights on tidal dynamics and tidal energy harvesting in the Alderney Race'.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems store approximately 80% of carbon in sediments, which could be emitted due to degradation and deforestation. Therefore, protecting and managing these ecosystems are crucial for climate change mitigation. This study aims to determine sediment bulk density (SBD), sediment organic carbon (SOC) concentration, and sediment carbon stocks (SCS) in mangroves and seagrasses, and to elucidate how the protection scheme impacts them. We collected four sediment cores of 100 cm each from protected and unprotected mangrove areas and three sediment cores of 80 cm each from unprotected and protected seagrass areas. The average SBD in mangroves was 0.48 g cmâˆ’3 in protected areas and 0.55 g cmâˆ’3 in unprotected areas, while the average SBD in seagrass was 0.79 g cmâˆ’3 in protected areas and 0.85 g cmâˆ’3 in unprotected areas. The average SOC in mangroves was 8.65% in protected areas and 8.63% in unprotected areas, while the average SOC in seagrass was 5.89% and 6.25% in protected and unprotected areas, respectively. The average SCS in the protected area was 381 and 363 Mg C haâˆ’1 in the mangrove and seagrass ecosystems, respectively. On the other hand, the average SCS in the unprotected areas was 449 and 422 Mg C haâˆ’1 in mangroves and seagrass ecosystems, respectively. Although we did not find any significant differences in SCS between protected and unprotected ecosystems regardless of ecosystem types, the conservation management of blue carbon ecosystems is still needed to avoid future carbon emissions.

JO  - Applied Energy
PY  - 2020
VL  - 279
IS  - NA
AB  - The reduction of emissions generated by internal combustion engines represents one of the most important research topics in the marine sector. This especially refers to carbon dioxide (CO2) which is a major greenhouse gas. This paper deals with the viability of alternative fuels to reduce CO2 emissions in the Croatian short-sea shipping sector over a ship lifetime. The aim of the study is to identify appropriate alternatives to diesel-powered options, taking account of environmental and economic criteria. Besides diesel, which is currently the main marine fuel in Croatia, an analysis was conducted of electricity, methanol, dimethyl ether, natural gas, hydrogen and biodiesel, and the results are illustrated on three different Croatian ro-ro passenger ships, operating on short, moderate and relatively long routes, respectively. Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) indicated the most environmentally friendly power system configuration with alternative fuel. The investigation from an economical point of view was performed by Life-Cycle Cost Assessment (LCCA) which also considered potential carbon allowance scenarios. The results highlighted an electricity-powered ship as the most ecological as well as the most cost-effective option among those that are investigated, taking account of the real Croatian electricity mix that includes 46\% of renewable sources.

AB  - Emissions from vessels are a major environmental concern because of their impacts on the deterioration of the environment, especially global warming of the atmosphere. Therefore, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) concerns significant care to environmental protection through the reduction of exhaust emission and improvement of energy efficiency through technical and operational measures. Among the suggested measures from IMO, the alternative fuel such as natural gas has the priority to be used instead of fossil fuels. The present paper calculates the effect of using natural gas in a dual-fuel engine from environmental and energy efficiency perspectives. As a case study, a container ship has been investigated. The results of the analysis show that the percent of CO2, NOx, and SOx emission reduction corresponding to using a dual-fuel engine operated by natural gas instead of a diesel engine operated by heavy fuel oil is about 30.4%, 85.3%, and 97%, respectively. Moreover, it found that NOx and SOx emission rates of the dual-fuel engine comply with the IMO 2016 and 2020 limits, respectively. Furthermore, the Energy Efficiency Design Index value in the case of using dual-fuel engine is lower than the value by using diesel engine by about 30%, and this value will be 77.18%, 86.84%, and 99.27% of the required value for the first, second, and third phases, respectively, as recommended by IMO.

AB  - Technical regulation is carried out based on the real possibility of ensuring the required level of environmental friendliness of harmful emissions. Requirements for the environmental safety of ships are developed by the International Marine Organization (IMO). The requirements of IMO standards, applications, and protocols of the MARPOL 73/78 convention regulate technical, organizational, and legal environmental protection issues at sea. Their implementation often leads to a reduction of the economic and energy performance of marine diesel engines. However, the main difficulties in ensuring the environmental safety of internal combustion engines are associated with the selectivity of the components of the exhaust gases system. The innovative scheme of Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system with using the heat of recirculation gas by absorption chiller (ACh) for cooling the air at the intake of main ship engine is proposed. The effect of using the heat of recirculation gas for cooling engine intake air is analyzed considering the changing climatic conditions on the vesselâ€™s route line. The results of calculations have shown reducing the emissions of harmful substances (NOX by 26 to 39%; SOX by 9 to 14%) when the engine is running with recirculation of gas.

TI  - Derivation of seawater pCO(2) from net community production identifies the South Atlantic Ocean as a CO2 source
JO  - Biogeosciences
PY  - 2022
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
AB  - A key step in assessing the global carbon budget is the determination of the partial pressure of CO2 in seawater (pCO(2(sw))). Spatially complete observational fields of pCO(2(sw)) are routinely produced for regional and global ocean carbon budget assessments by extrapolating sparse in situ measurements of pCO(2(sw)) using satellite observations. As part of this process, satellite chlorophyll a (Chl a) is often used as a proxy for the biological drawdown or release of CO2. Chl a does not, however, quantify carbon fixed through photosynthesis and then respired, which is determined by net community production (NCP). In this study, pCO(2(sw)) over the South Atlantic Ocean is estimated using a feed forward neural network (FNN) scheme and either satellite-derived NCP, net primary production (NPP) or Chl a to compare which biological proxy produces the most accurate fields of pCO(2(sw)). Estimates of pCO(2(sw)) using NCP, NPP or Chl a were similar, but NCP was more accurate for the Amazon Plume and upwelling regions, which were not fully reproduced when using Chl a or NPP. A perturbation analysis assessed the potential maximum reduction in pCO(2(sw)) uncertainties that could be achieved by reducing the uncertainties in the satellite biological parameters. This illustrated further improvement using NCP compared to NPP or Chl a. Using NCP to estimate pCO(2(sw)) showed that the South Atlantic Ocean is a CO2 source, whereas if no biological parameters are used in the FNN (following existing annual carbon assessments), this region appears to be a sink for CO2. These results highlight that using NCP improved the accuracy of estimating pCO(2(sw)) and changes the South Atlantic Ocean from a CO2 sink to a source. Reducing the uncertainties in NCP derived from satellite parameters will ultimately improve our understanding and confidence in quantification of the global ocean as a CO2 sink.

JO  - Transactions On Maritime Science-toms
PY  - 2021
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - In order for the maritime sector to align itself with the targets set by the Paris Agreement, it should reduce its GHG emissions by at least 50\% by 2050 compared to 2008 with the ultimate aim to phase them out entirely. It is along these lines that in April 2018 the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) developed a strategy, consisting of a range of potential technical and operational measures to reduce GHG emissions from international shipping, ranking from improvements on ship design to the employment of alternative fuels. In order to stimulate the adoption of these policies, the IMO also considers the implementation of market-based measures (MBM) that will provide additional incentives to shipowners to invest in new technologies and uptake of cleaner fuels. The MBMs analysed in this paper include two different policies proposed by different countries and associations for the abatement of GHG emissions from shipping: a) the International Fund for GHG emissions from ships that includes the imposition of a global levy on marine bunker fuel for all vessels and b) the Maritime Emission Trading System (METS) that requires all maritime companies to buy/sell emission allowances to meet their annual emission reductions targets, setting a cap on global shipping emissions. This paper presents and analyses these two diverse MBMs, highlighting their main advantages and drawbacks. The scope of this paper is to investigate the potential of these MBMs to incentivise investments in new technologies and alternative fuels, both essential for the decarbonisation of the maritime sector.

In order to comply with this, a number of efforts are being made to reduce fuel consumption in ships. In this study, in order to utilize engine exhaust waste heat, a carbon dioxide power cycle, which utilizes a carbon dioxide as a working fluid in contrast to conventional steam power cycle, was investigated. The power cycle was modeled and simulated to investigate its characteristics and performances under the shipboard waste heat recovery condition. The cycle power was maximized by using multivariate optimization method at various cycle minimum temperature conditions. Simulation results show that when the cycle's lowest temperature varied in the range of 16-40 degC, the waste heat recovery system increases power by 7.1-3.5\%.

AB  - The international maritime organization (IMO) has introduced several legislations to optimize the use of energy generated from machinery onboard ships to reduce the emitted exhaust gas emissions. The aim of the current paper is to study the effect of using emission reduction strategies for container ships with emphasis on the improved Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) from environmental and economic points of view. As a case study, A19 and A7 class container ships are investigated. Three different options are considered including natural gas, treatment equipment, and ship speed reduction. The lowest annual emission rates per transported cargo are achieved by A19. These rates are 18.9, 0.93, and 1.8 kg/TEU for NOx, SOx, and CO2 emissions, respectively. In order to improve the EEDI value for the A7, the ship speed should be reduced by 22.5\%. This will comply with the three phases of IMO requirements by reducing CO2 emissions with cost-effectiveness of 52.54 \$/ton CO2. On the other hand, using the installed dual-fuel engine infrastructure onboard A19 container ship will improve the energy efficiency by 10.13\% with annual fuel saving of 23.73 million dollars.

JO  - Environmental Science And Technology
PY  - 2021
VL  - 55
IS  - 9
AB  - Vegetated coastal habitats (VCHs) rank among the most intense carbon sinks in natural ecosystems, playing an important role in the global carbon cycle. A significant part of the organic carbon (OC) they store may be allochthonous OC that has been sequestered elsewhere. Yet, the compositions of allochthonous OC are largely unknown. Here, we present concentrations and carbon isotopic (13C and 14C) compositions and accumulation rates of carbon in the VCHs from major temperate-subtropical deltas of China: Yellow, Yangtze, and Pearl river deltas. We find that black carbon (BC) amounts to 9-25% of OC across sites. Temperate VCHs exhibit lower BC contents but higher BC contributions than subtropical VCHs. This seemingly counterintuitive result can be explained by increased accumulation of long-term, stable, allochthonous OC in temperate VCHs. BC in temperate VCHs contains 1.5-2 times more fossil BC than that in subtropical VCHs in the 1 m depth soil, which is likely influenced by atmospheric input and the aging effect. We estimate an accumulation rate of BC in China's VCHs of 33.1 Â± 14.5 g m-2 year-1, acting as a hotspot for BC burial. These results point to a substantial and hitherto unquantified contribution of BC components to blue carbon storage, as well as the VCHs to global BC storage. Preservation of this old-aged, stable OC implies an important ecosystem service of the VCHs for climate change mitigation. Â© 2021 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

PY  - 2017
VL  - 57
IS  - NA
AB  - In 2016, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) decided on global regulations to reduce sulphur emissions to air from maritime shipping starting 2020. The regulation implies that ships can continue to use residual fuels with a high sulphur content, such as heavy fuel oil (HFO), if they employ scrubbers to desulphurise the exhaust gases. Alternatively, they can use fuels with less than 0.5\% sulphur, such as desulphurised HFO, distillates (diesel) or liquefied natural gas (LNG). The options of lighter fuels and desulphurisation entail costs, including higher energy consumption at refineries, and the present study identifies and compares compliance options as a function of ship type and operational patterns. The results indicate distillates as an attractive option for smaller vessels, while scrubbers will be an attractive option for larger vessels. For all vessels, apart from the largest fuel consumers, residual fuels desulphurised to less than 0.5\% sulphur are also a competing abatement option. Moreover, we analyse the interaction between global SOX reductions and CO2 (and fuel consumption), and the results indicate that the higher fuel cost for distillates will motivate shippers to lower speeds, which will offset the increased CO2 emissions at the refineries. Scrubbers, in contrast, will raise speeds and CO2 emissions.

AB  - A collaborative study has recently completed a storage capacity prospectivity assessment and pre-competitive data acquisition program in the southern margin of the offshore Gippsland Basin, Australia. Potential CO2 storage sites that could become available in the next ~25 years will be restricted to sites in the nearshore and southern parts of the offshore Gippsland Basin. This is in order to minimize possible resource interactions with ongoing petroleum production and low salinity groundwater in the northern and central parts of the basin. The injection target, the Latrobe Group has been identified as a suitable candidate for large-scale CO2 geological storage. As part of the storage capacity assessment, a detailed geological model of the Latrobe Group sequence was constructed in an area of the southern margin of the basin. The model evaluates two main east-west-trending fault systems separating the model into three structural segments: a deep depocentre, flanked by the Southern Terrace, and thin Southern Platform. The sedimentary sequences comprise coastal plain to shallow marine sandstone deposits interbedded with laterally continuous coals and mudstones, which act as seals and baffles of varying quality. Uncertainty in the reservoir architecture and the impact on connectivity of the permeability field was assessed by way of multiple model realizations. The model was then used as the basis for a series of capacity and injectivity estimations employing theoretical, analytical, and numerical flow simulation modelling techniques. At the highest end, for an area excluding the platform and assuming low sweep efficiency, estimates of the theoretical CO2 storage capacity ranged between 865 million tons (Mt) and 2,800 Mt. For the analytical model estimates were up to 900 Mt and numerical methods estimates were in the order of 200 Mt to 550 Mt assuming 3 injection wells in a 40 Ã— 40 km area over 30 years. All of the results are highly sensitive to the estimation method used and input provided such as, net area defined, injection interval selected, uncertainties on fault seal, and boundary conditions. However, the insights gained from the numerical modelling studies in the region have indicated that carbon storage injection has the greatest potential southwest of the Bream field. After 1,000 years post injection, accumulations of mobile gas can be observed at different locations within the model, suggesting several vertical and lateral pathways. Key outcomes of the simulations support the concept of the southern margin of the Gippsland Basin being prospective for further CO2 storage exploration, namely that it is feasible to achieve injection and containment of commercial scale volumes of CO2 in parts of this region without adversely impacting existing resources.

AB  - Many countries have executed Offshore wind farms to Compensate electricity shortage. Offshore wind energy have a larger capacity factor than onshore wind energy. An offshore wind energy could competitive with conventional power plants because it could have a larger amount of MWs. The intermittent nature of offshore wind farms could have significantly impact on the operation and maintenance cost, stability, and reliability of it's connected power grid. To overcome the intermittency nature off wind energy and ensure the stability of the system during large events, modern offshore hybrid solar and wind farms have implemented. The effects of a large-scale offshore hybrid farm (OHF) on power system stability are studied. The high voltage direct current is the optimal system to connect the offshore hybrid farm to the main grid through a voltage source converter (VSC) because the large distance to shore. The proposed model is studied on the IEEE New-England 10-machine 39-bus test system. Modeling and stability analysis the hybrid offshore hybrid farm are presented. In this paper, a developed method is proposed for optimal sizing of the offshore PV/wind hybrid system taking into account the dynamic stability of power grid.

AB  - Abstract: This paper is concerned with the issue of the efficiency of sea wave energy conversion. It is shown that the efficiency increases significantly if a low-damped mechanical oscillator, which is adapted to a wave power spectrum, is used as a primary converter. Two major types of oscillators are considered. The pendulum-type converter is found to be the most promising. A new schematic of a pendulum-type converter is suggested and briefly described. The converter consists of two oscillators adjusted to work in resonance mode. The first one includes a ballast-controlled floating platform pitching on sea waves. The second oscillator is a long sector-shaped pendulum located on the floating platform. The use of sea wave energy converters is promising in regard to the widespread use of renewable sources and elimination of the environmental impact of fossil fuel consumption in coastal regions. Various systems have been developed and projects implemented in this field. Â© 2019, Allerton Press, Inc.

AB  - The identification of carbon pools and the quantification of carbon stocks is necessary to (1) track changes in ecosystem dynamics, (2) inform science-based ecosystem and blue-carbon management, and (3) evaluate ecosystem and food web models. However, estimates of organic carbon stocks in marine ecosystems are incomplete or inconsistent. Therefore, we provide a first consistent estimate of relevant organic carbon stocks of a distinct marine ecosystem- the Baltic Sea. We estimate its contemporary standing stocks of 18 non-living and living organic carbon pools using data from literature and open-access databases. In contrast to existing data, our estimates are valid for the entire Baltic Sea, include necessary pools and are verifiable, as we describe data sources, methods and the associated uncertainties in detail to allow reproduction and critical evaluation. The total organic carbon (TOC) in the Baltic Sea ecosystem amounts to 1,050 +/- 90 gC/m(2) (440 +/- 40 Mt). The non-living stocks account for about 98.8\% and the living stocks for 1.2\% of the TOC. Our estimates indicate that benthos has the highest living organic carbon stock and that the stock of particulate organic carbon (POC) has been underestimated in some previous studies. In addition, we find a partially inverted biomass distribution with a higher stock of primary consumers than primary producers. Our estimates provide a baseline of the size and distribution of the organic carbon in the Baltic Sea for the current period. Analyses of inorganic carbon stocks and the interplay between inorganic and organic stocks must follow to further define the baseline of total carbon stocks in the Baltic Sea.

AB  - Shipping is a heavily regulated industry and responsible for around 3\% of global carbon emissions. Global trade is highly dependent on shipping which covers around 90\% of commercial demand. Now the industry is expected to navigate through many twists and turns of different situations like upcoming regulations, climate change, energy shortages and technological revolutions. Technological development is apparent across all marine sectors due to the rapid development of sensor technology, IT, automation and robotics. The industry must continue to develop at a rapid pace over the next decade in order to be able to adapt to upcoming regulations and market pressure. Ship intelligence will be the driving force shaping the future of the industry. Ships generate a large volume of data from different sources and in different formats. So big data has become the talk of the industry nowadays. Big data analysis discovers correlations between different measurable or unmeasurable parameters to determine hidden patterns and trends. This analysis will have a significant impact on vessel performance monitoring and provide performance prediction, real-time transparency, and decision-making support to the ship operator. Big data will also bring new opportunities and challenges for the maritime industry. It will increase the capability of performance monitoring, remove human error and increase interdependencies of components. However, the industry will have to face many challenges such as data processing, reliability, and data security. Many regulations rely on ship data including the new EU MRV (Monitoring, Reporting and Verification) regulation to quantify the CO2 emissions for ships above 5000 gross tonnage. As a result, ship operators will have to monitor and report the verified amount of CO2 emitted by their vessels on voyages to, from and between EU ports and will also be required to provide information on energy efficiency parameters.

AB  - Regular transport of commercial liquid CO2 by ships has been established in Northern Europe. This technology can be adjusted for the large quantities of CO2 needed for EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) at North Sea oil fields. To liquefy the CO2, it has to be compressed, condensed, and depressurized. The temperature is controlled by the pressure. In principle, there are two process alternatives. Dependent on the temperature of available cooling water, either CO2 can be used directly as a cooling medium, or ammonia (NH3) has to be used as an intermediate coolant. Disadvantages with NH3 are its toxicity and the cost of an extra compressor. The total power consumption is approximately the same for the two process alternatives. Production, intermediate storage, and ship transport of commercial CO2 is a proven technology. This process can be modified and designed for handling large amount of CO2 for injection in the North Sea, either for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EGR) or permanent storage in an aquifer. Feasibility studies have been carried out to find practical and cost effective ways of producing and handling liquid CO2, focusing on quantity rather than purity. To reduce investment costs of storage and ship tanks, it is required to operate as close to the triple point of 4.17 barg and -56.6 Â°C as practically feasible. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Future LNG field development project in Indonesia will be dominated by local buyer of the country, so that additional LNG tankers are needed for the domestic market in the future. Theoretically Dual Fuel Steam Mechanical (DFSM) or steam propulsion system has a low thermal efficiency, but more reliable than the DFDE propulsion system. On the other hand Dual Fuel Diesel Electric (DFDE) propulsion system has shortcomings in the technology that is the presence of methane slip potential for global warming with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 20-25 times greater than CO2 over a period of 100 years or 20 times at intervals of 20 years, thus actually reducing the achievement of the energy efficiency of the propulsion system. In this paper, two LNG ship propulsion system that is DFSM and DFDE which is currently the most widely used by operators in Indonesia were compared technically and economically. Technically, the IMO guidelines on Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and the Energy Efficiency Operational Index (EEOI) were used as a means of comparison, while from the economical side life cycle cost (LCC) CAPEX and OPEX cost-based of the ships were analysed. Based on the technical evaluation using the guidelines EEDI and EEOI of LNG tankers by considering the slip of methane in the DFDE propulsion system, showed that the value of the achievement of EEDI and EEOI the DFSM propulsion system lower (more efficient) than the value of the achievement of the DFDE propulsion system and economics evaluation based on the LNG tankers cost life cycle (LCC) for 20 years by considering the risks of loss and penalty carriage of LNG that may occur due to the failure of the propulsion system and the BOG system, shows the DFSM propulsion system more efficient than DFDE system.

AB  - Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased over time, implied on global warming and climate change. Blue carbon is one of interesting options to reduce CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Indonesia has the largest mangrove area in the world which would be potential to mitigate elevated CO2 concentrations. A quantitative study on CO2 dynamic was conducted in the habitat-variable and pristine mangrove of Bintan island. The study was aimed to estimate CO2 flux on three different mangrove habitats, i.e., lagoon, oceanic and riverine. Even though all habitats were dominated by Rhizophora sp, they were significantly differed one another by species composition, density, and soil characteristics. Averagely, CO2 dynamics had the positive budget by âˆ¼0.668 Mmol/ha (82.47%) which consisted of sequestration, decomposition, and soil efflux at 0.810 Mmol/ha/y, -0.125 Mmol/ha/y and -0.017 Mmol/ha/y, respectively. The study found that the fringing habitat had the highest CO2 capturing rate and the lowest rate of litter decomposition which was contrast to the riverine site. Therefore, oceanic mangrove was more efficient in controlling CO2 dynamics due to higher carbon storage on their biomass. A recent study also found that soil density and organic matter had a significant impact on CO2 dynamics. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - To reach the International Maritime Organization, IMO, vision of a 50\% greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by 2050, there is a need for action. Good decision support is needed for decisions on fuel and energy conversion systems due to the complexity. This paper aims to get an overview of the criteria types included in present assessments of future marine fuels, to evaluate these and to highlight the most important criteria. This is done using a literature review of selected scientific articles and reports and the authors' own insights from assessing marine fuels. There are different views regarding the goal of fuel change, what fuel names to use as well as regarding the criteria to assess, which therefore vary in the literature. Quite a few articles and reports include a comparison of several alternative fuels. To promote a transition to fuels with significant GHG reduction potential, it is crucial to apply a life cycle perspective and to assess fuel options in a multicriteria perspective. The recommended minimum set of criteria to consider when evaluating future marine fuels differ somewhat between fuels that can be used in existing ships and fuels that can be used in new types of propulsion systems.

JO  - Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences Of The United States Of America
PY  - 2010
VL  - 107
IS  - 36
AB  - Geoengineering has been proposed as a feasible way of mitigating anthropogenic climate change, especially increasing global temperatures in the 21st century. The two main geoengineering options are limiting incoming solar radiation, or modifying the carbon cycle. Here we examine the impact of five geoengineering approaches on sea level; SO2 aerosol injection into the stratosphere, mirrors in space, afforestation, biochar, and bioenergy with carbon sequestration. Sea level responds mainly at centennial time scales to temperature change, and has been largely driven by anthropogenic forcing since 1850. Making use a model of sea-level rise as a function of time-varying climate forcing factors (solar radiation, volcanism, and greenhouse gas emissions) we find that sea-level rise by 2100 will likely be 30 cm higher than 2000 levels despite all but the most aggressive geoengineering under all except the most stringent greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The least risky and most desirable way of limiting sea-level rise is bioenergy with carbon sequestration. However aerosol injection or a space mirror system reducing insolation at an accelerating rate of 1 Wm(-2) per decade from now to 2100 could limit or reduce sea levels. Aerosol injection delivering a constant 4 Wm(-2) reduction in radiative forcing (similar to a 1991 Pinatubo eruption every 18 months) could delay sea-level rise by 40-80 years. Aerosol injection appears to fail cost-benefit analysis unless it can be maintained continuously, and damage caused by the climate response to the aerosols is less than about 0.6\% Global World Product.

VL  - NA

AB  - Offshore wind energy is one of the most important new energies that are developing fast in the world. There is an in-neglecting problem in offshore wind turbine system similar to other offshore structures that the offshore wind turbine system is in the severe sea states. Especially in the regions which influenced by tropical cyclones, the strong winds, surges and huge waves induced by storms will lead to the structure failures and make large losing. In meteorology field, more attentions are paid in the mechanism of the storm process than the effect of storms to the structures. While in engineering field, the combination of wind, wave and current with some return period is selected according to the design code, then the response analysis of structures will be performed. The influence of storm induced extreme sea environment factors to the wind turbine system is not considered reasonably. According to the previous research, Multivariate Compound Extreme Value Distribution (MCEVD) is effective in the joint probability prediction of extreme sea states. It also can be used in the probability analysis of structure stress. And grey model is adaptive for the prediction based on short stochastic sample series. It can be used in reliability analysis of offshore structures. In this study, numerical simulation, probability analysis and prediction based on theory of grey system are used to propose a nested model for the reliability analysis of offshore wind turbine system. The model is consisted of MCEVD, Grey Markov Chain Model (GMCM) and structure dynamic response model. Using the nested model, the influence of tropical cyclone to the offshore wind turbine system in the South China Sea is analyzed. Â© 2011, World Scientific. All rights reserved.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 50
IS  - NA
AB  - This review examines the current understanding of the global coastal ocean carbon cycle and provides a new quantitative synthesis of air-sea CO2 exchange. This reanalysis yields an estimate for the globally integrated coastal ocean CO2 flux of -0.25 +/- 0.05 Pg C year(-1), with polar and subpolar regions accounting for most of the CO2 removal (>90\%). A framework that classifies river-dominated ocean margin (RiOMar) and ocean-dominated margin (OceMar) systems is used to conceptualize coastal carbon cycle processes. The carbon dynamics in three contrasting case study regions, the Baltic Sea, the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and the South China Sea, are compared in terms of the spatiotemporal variability of surface pCO(2). Ocean carbon models that range from box models to three-dimensional coupled circulation-biogeochemical models are reviewed in terms of the ability to simulate key processes and project future changes in different continental shelf regions. Common unresolved challenges remain for implementation of these models across RiOMar and OceMar systems. The long-term trends in coastal ocean carbon fluxes for different coastal systems under anthropogenic stress that are emerging in observations and numerical simulations are highlighted. Knowledge gaps in projecting future perturbations associated with before and after net-zero CO2 emissions in the context of concurrent changes in the land-ocean-atmosphere coupled system pose a key challenge. A new synthesis yields an estimate for a globally integrated coastal ocean carbon sink of -0.25 Pg C year(-1), with greater than 90\% of atmospheric CO2 removal occurring in polar and subpolar regions. The sustained coastal and open ocean carbon sink is vital in mitigating climate change and meeting the target set by the Paris Agreement. Uncertainties in the future coastal ocean carbon cycle are associated with concurrent trends and changes in the land-ocean-atmosphere coupled system. The major gaps and challenges identified for current coastal ocean carbon research have important implications for climate and sustainability policies.

Many of the relevant authorities maritime domain gave great interesting to that issue, either through research that discussed the impact of marine fuel consumption on the environment and economy of ships or through practical experiments' that are made by marine engine manufacturers. Over the years, many solutions have been put forward to overcome this problem while maintaining the amount of goods transported globally at the same transfer rate and ship speed. The present paper sheds light on many of the methods used currently to reach this purpose. It is explained that applying a certain fuel-saving strategy will rely on some of the factors, especially the type of ship. Mainly two methods including: shore-side power and cold out of heat strategies have been investigated regarding adaption, economic, and environmental issues in case of applying onboard highspeed passenger ships.

AB  - Because of the long lifetime of newbuilding vessels, shipowners' emission abatement solutions will have a profound impact on the greening transition of the shipping industry. A multinominal logit model is developed to identify the key determinants that affect the shipowners' choice of the solutions. New findings include: (1) Alternative fuels (e.g. liquefied natural gas) are the most attractive choice for gas ships and pure car carriers; and dry bulk ships and crude tankers prefer to use low-sulfur fuels. (2) Singaporean and Japanese shipowners are more likely to adopt the alternative fuels. (3) The IMO 2020 cap has significantly affected shipowners' preference for scrubbers but not for alternative fuels. It is well known that economic factors affecting a ship-owner's decisions include freight rate and bunker cost but these factors weakly influence the emission abatement solution choice for new ships. This research provides helpful insights for the policymaker to guide shipowners to invest in more eco-friendly vessels and assist various stakeholders in forming efficient decisions.

AB  - The onshore generation of wind and solar energy is a reality in Brazil. There are approximately 700 projects generating wind energy in the Northeast and South regions and 4000 generating solar energy distributed throughout the country. In addition, Brazil has an extensive Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and a very diverse climate, which can contribute to offshore and complementary technologies. The concept of complementarity integrates technology and innovation studies, which are associated with the more efficient use of renewable resources through a better understanding of their intermittency and availability. This study aims to evaluate the complementarity of offshore wind and solar energy along the Brazilian coastline by assessing the theoretical and technical potential of the resources. Wind and solar radiation hourly data of the ERA5 reanalysis are used from 1990 to 2019. A series of technical and environmental restrictions and other uses of the ocean space is assumed to calculate the usable area. The IEA-15 MW wind turbines and crystalline silicon solar panels are considered to calculate annual energy production and capacity factor. The results show the annual and hourly complementarity of the offshore wind and solar energy sources. It is observed that, for instance, offshore solar complements offshore wind up to 40\% in the Northeast region within water depth up to 50 m. Additionally, it shows that the monthly energy production of a co-located offshore wind-solar farm in the Northeast region can reach up to 300\% more than the hydropower generation.

AB  - With the increase of greenhouse-gas regulation in marine vessels, more attention has been paid to the energy saving and carbon reduction problems. Main propulsion and service power systems that cause emissions and result in significant fuel oil costs are among the major energy saving and carbon reduction problems. Better fuel efficiency and cleaner emissions alternatives for main propulsion and ship service power, that provide different improvement levels, can be used to match individual owner's special needs. Cost effective analysis is essential and important when considering the economic competitiveness of these alternatives. In order to provide accurate cost analysis results, a set of cost analysis model for ship main propulsion and service generator systems is proposed in this paper. A present value method is used to consider capital cost and operational & maintenance costs in the economic life of equipment in the analysis. Several possible propulsion and electrical power generation options are studied by using ship practical data. To reduce effects of uncertain parameters on analysis result and determine critical parameters, sensitive analyses are also performed. The model developed can assist owners in establishing a business case for currently available or further ship powering and electrical generator systems.

VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Even though cold ironing is not a new technology applied to reduce the impact of emissions from ships at berth, commonly used arrangements for shore-side power substations only allow a unidirectional power flow, from port to ship side. Although these applications have a positive contribution to port community health and global reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG), especially when the energy is supplied from renewable sources, emissions during loading/unloading operations are directly related to the operating profiles of auxiliary engines of a ship. The present work evaluates a shipâ€™s emission impact when applying cold-ironing technology using a bi-directional power flow control strategy while at berth, thus optimizing the auxiliary engine operating profile and enabling regeneration into the port installations. The methodology applied considers the establishment of the operational profile of the ship, the adaptation and use of carbon intensity indicators (CII) used by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to evaluate the impact of shipping, and the strategy considering the capacities of the ship to obtain and provide electric power from and to the port when at berth. Results show that the strategy can be applied to any ship with a high demand for electric power while at berth, and that the adaptation and use of different CIIs allows operational profiles of electric power generation on board to be optimized and to reduce emission generation, which affects port community health.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) established new strategies that could lead to a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of the shipping sector to address global warming. A major factor in achieving this goal is transitioning to renewable fuels. This implies a challenge, as not only ship-innovative solutions but also a complete low-carbon fuel supply chain must be implemented. This work provides a method enabling the exploration of the potential of low-carbon fuel technologies for specific shipping routes up to larger sea regions. Several aspects including vessel sizes, impact of weather and shipping routes, emissions savings and costs are considered. The local energy use is determined with proven bottom-up prediction methods based on ship positioning data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in combination with weather and ship technical data. This methodology was extended by an approach to the generation of a basic low-carbon fuel system topology that enables the consideration of local demand profiles. The applicability of the proposed approach is discussed at hand via a case study on Roll-on/Roll-off passenger and cargo (RoPax) ferries transitioning from conventional fuels to a compressed hydrogen fuel system. The results indicate a potential reduction in emissions by up to 95% and possible system sizes and costs. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The article's applications are very important, as it is only a dozen or so years since the current issues of protection of the atmosphere against emissions of toxic compounds from ships. The issue was discussed against the background of binding legal norms, including rules introduced by the IMO (International Maritime Organization) in the context of the MARPOL Convention (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships), Annex VI, with the main goal to significantly strengthen the emission limits in light of technological improvements. Taking these standards into account, effective methods should be implemented to reduce toxic compounds' emissions to the atmosphere, including nitrogen oxides NOx and carbon dioxide CO2. The purpose of the article was, based on the results of our own research, to indicate the impact of the effectiveness of selected methods on reducing the level of nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide emitted by the marine engine. The laboratory tests were carried out with the use of the one-cylinder two stroke, cross head supercharged diesel engine. Methods of reducing their emissions in the study were adopted, including supplying the engine with fuel mixtures of marine diesel oil (MDO) and rapeseed oil ester (RME)-(MDO/RME mixtures) and changing the fuel injection parameters and the advance angles of fuel injection. The supply of the engine during the tests and the mixtures of marine diesel oil (MDO) and rape oil esters (RMEs) caused a clear drop in emissions of nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide, particularly for a higher engine load, as has been shown. The decrease of the injection advance angle unambiguously makes the NOx content in exhaust gas lower.

TI  - Wind and solar energy resources potential across coastal mega cities, of Pakistan

PY  - 2019
VL  - 8
IS  - 2 Special Issue 8
AB  - Pakistan has the vast potential of renewable energy (RE) resources but still, rely on the pricy fossil fuel-based power generation. The developed nation work on the shifting of conventional resources based generation into renewable energy-based generation, but Pakistan still engages to negotiate fossil fuel trade. However, Pakistan has 1100Km of the coastal belt that acquires the huge potential of RE. The different metrological department measure the RE exists in Pakistan, the World Bank Group is one of them. The World Bank group observe the solar and wind potential across the megacity of Pakistan including Karachi. In this research, we have explored the World Bank efforts by highlighting the availability of the solar and wind power across coastal megacity, of Pakistan. The main focus is on the estimates of global horizontal irradiation (GHI) parameter of solar and wind speed for wind resources along with the yearly values provided by the World Bank. The wind power depend on wind speed across so, in this research, the wind speed is observed across the coastal megacity of Pakistan for the wind turbine installation. The wind speed data is occupied from the World Bank site to explore wind model for the future power supply across Karachi of Pakistan. Similarly, the solar irradiation calculation is very much important to install solar models. So we have select the GHI for the solar observation across Karachi of Pakistan. The GHI data is taken from the World Bank site and exploring on excel to find the future power generation across coastal megacity of Pakistan. Both wind speed and GHI parameter are observed by a yearly basis. It is detected that the regular trend for each of the selected years is related to the next year so the perceived trend of GHI and wind speed is valid for the upcoming year. Hence the GHI and wind speed availability indicate the installation of solar penal and wind turbine for the power generation across the coastal megacity of Pakistan. The GHI and wind speed experimental data for the coastal megacity contain a huge amount of solar and wind potential. The planner needs to explore this energy by installing a suitable quantity of the solar plant and windmills for power generation. Â© BEIESP.

TI  - Development of a Life-cycle Cost Framework for Retrofitting Marine Engines towards Emission Reduction in Shipping
JO  - Ifac Papersonline

VL  - 54

AB  - The shipping industry is striving to reduce its negative environmental footprint and become more energy-efficient. In order to achieve this, undergoing the transition towards innovative engine and propulsion systems is attracting considerable attention. However, the economic aspect is of paramount importance for decision-makers (e.g. ship owners) when it comes to investing in innovative technologies. For this reason, it is required to have a comprehensive and holistic view on the economic impacts of such technologies at an early stage. This paper proposes a life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) framework to be implemented for innovative emission reduction marine engines. The proposed framework will be able to serve as a decision support tool that is beneficial for ship owners during the decision-making process for retrofitting investments.

AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from shipping activities increased by 9% in 2018. Tankers are one of the contributors to total ship emissions. To reduce these emissions, the International Maritime Organization adopted the Green House Gas Strategy by issuing a regulation in the form of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). This study aims to obtain the distribution of EEDI tankers in Indonesia. The EEDI calculation uses empirical equations that consider the main engine power, auxiliary engine power, and reference speed. The ship data used are 638 units of Indonesian-flagged tankers, including ship particulars from the classification agency. The results of this study indicate that compliance with the EEDI regulation is 26%. Through the application of engine power limitation technology and innovative technology in the form of weather routing, waste heat recovery, solar panels, and electronically controlled engines, EEDI fulfillment increased to 78%.

JO  - Frontiers In Marine Science
PY  - 2020
VL  - 7
IS  - NA
AB  - While seawater acidification induced by elevated CO2 is known to impact coccolithophores, the effects in combination with decreased salinity caused by sea ice melting and/or hydrological events have not been documented. Here we show the combined effects of seawater acidification and reduced salinity on growth, photosynthesis and calcification of Emiliania huxleyi grown at 2 CO2 concentrations (low CO2 LC:400 mu atm; high CO2 HC:1000 mu atm) and 3 levels of salinity (25, 30, and 35 parts per thousand). A decrease of salinity from 35 to 25 parts per thousand increased growth rate, cell size and photosynthetic performance under both LC and HC. Calcification rates were relatively insensitive to salinity though they were higher in the LC-grown compared to the HC grown cells at 25 parts per thousand salinity, with insignificant differences under 30 and 35 parts per thousand. Since salinity and OA treatments did not show interactive effects on calcification, changes in calcification:photosynthesis ratios are attributed to the elevated photosynthetic rates at lower salinities, with higher ratios of calcification to photosynthesis in the cells grown under 35 parts per thousand compared with those grown at 25 parts per thousand. In contrast, photosynthetic carbon fixation increased almost linearly with decreasing salinity, regardless of the pCO(2) treatments. When subjected to short-term exposure to high light, the low-salinity grown cells showed the highest photochemical effective quantum yield with the highest repair rate, though the HC treatment enhanced the PSII damage rate. Our results suggest that, irrespective of pCO(2), at low salinity Emiliania huxleyi up-regulates its photosynthetic performance which, despite a relatively insensitive calcification response, may help it better adapt to future ocean global environmental changes, including ocean acidification, especially in the coastal areas of high latitudes.

AB  - As shipping is setting sail for a sustainable future, the application of fuel cells is increasingly regarded as a promising technology to reduce or fully eliminate emissions. Fuel cells convert the chemical energy in fuels directly into electricity, achieving high efficiencies while emitting no hazardous compounds and producing little noise and vibrations. This chapter provides an overview of different fuel cell systems and discusses the various fuel cell types, working principles and characteristics. Particular attention is given to the low and high temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell and solid oxide fuel cell, as these are often considered to hold most potential for application in ships. The application of fuel cells is not restricted to the use of pure hydrogen, thus an overview of relevant fuel processing and purification technologies is provided as well. Operational aspects including electrical efficiency, part load performance, load transients, system start-up, heat recovery and combined cycle operation are introduced and subsequently discussed in the context of maritime application. Aspects related to ship design and operation, emission regulation compliance, reliability, availability, maintenance, safety and economics are briefly considered. Finally, an overview of relevant maritime experience and a future outlook are provided. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fuel Consumption and CO2 Emission Reductions of Ships Powered by a Fuel-Cell-Based Hybrid Power Source
JO  - Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering
PY  - 2019
VL  - 7
IS  - 7
AB  - The need for technological development to reduce the impact of air pollution caused by ships has been strongly emphasized by many authorities, including the International Maritime Organization (IMO). This has encouraged research to develop an electric propulsion system using hydrogen fuel with the aim of reducing emissions from ships. This paper describes the test bed we constructed to compare our electric propulsion system with existing power sources. Our system uses hybrid power and a diesel engine generator with a combined capacity of 180 kW. To utilize scale-down methodology, the linear interpolation method is applied. The proposed hybrid power source consists of a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), a battery, and a diesel generator, the capacities of which are 100 kW, 30 Kw, and 50 kW, respectively. The experiments we conducted on the test bed were based on the outcome of an analysis of the electrical power consumed in each operating mode considering different types of merchant ships employed in practice. The output, fuel consumption, and CO2 emission reduction rates of the hybrid and conventional power sources were compared based on the load scenarios created for each type of ship. The CO2 emissions of the hybrid system was compared with the case of the diesel generator alone operation for each load scenario, with an average of 70\%similar to 74\%. This analysis confirmed the effectiveness of using a ship with a fuel-cell-based hybrid power source.

AB  - The Hong Kong Shipowners Association (HKSOA) has actively taken part in the development of effective ways to reduce the effect of the maritime industry's greenhouse gas emissions. The Association supports the work of the IMO in developing an Energy Efficiency Design Index, as it will be formulated for specific ship types and sizes. It also supports the development of sector specific Energy Efficiency Operational Indicators that will be included in Shipboard Efficiency Management Plans. While these will assist the future reduction of individual ship emissions, HKSOA believes that the international shipping sector's greenhouse gas emissions should in addition be regulated through a global, practical, administratively simple, and fraud-free scheme that accounts for the unique nature and practical reality of the industry. It has studied various proposals and supports the Compensation Fund promoted by the Danish Maritime Authority, believing that this should be used as the basis for developing industry-wide consensus. There are two distinct groups of options under consideration, i.e., Emissions Trading, or a levy or Compensation Fund. While it fundamentally supports the Fund concept over an Emissions Trading Scheme, the Association believes that a compromise solution can be developed that combines the simplicity of administration of the Compensation Fund with the political acceptability inherent in a declining cap or target that is one of the main features of Emission Trading schemes.

AB  - The simulator for geological CO2 storage combined with Enhanced Coalbed Methane Recovery (ECBMR) in the coal-bearing formation was developed. It was used for the safety assessment of the CO2 and CH4 migration in the formations. Two case studies were reported. The first one is the re-investigation of Yubari ECBMR project considering the permeability of the neighboring strata of coal seam and flow of gases into them. The permeability was estimated to be 0.01md. The second case study is the CO2 storage in under sea coal-bearing formation in Ariake Sea, Kyushu, Japan. The results showed that the CO2 was safely stored in the formation. However, the migration of CH4 liberated by displacement due to CO2 injection into upper formations is uncertain. This paper shows the advantages and disadvantages of CO2 storage in coal-bearing formation through two case studies. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the context of climate change, the interest for sustainable sources to produce energy is growing. One promising resource for biofuel production is microalgae, but their industrial use is limited by the lack of efficient harvesting techniques. In this study, we use a multi-scale approach to understand the magnesium hydroxide-mediated flocculation/flotation mechanism of Phaeodactylum tricornutum, an effective oil-producer diatom, under high pH. While flotation experiments give a population-scale quantification of the efficiency of flocculation/flotation using magnesium or calcium hydroxide, or at increased pH, AFM allows probing the mechanical properties of the cells at different pH values. Finally we develop an original strategy to functionalize AFM tips with hydroxide particles that we use in multiparametric imaging experiments to understand at the molecular scale the forces driving the adhesion of hydroxide particles to cells. Altogether, our results give a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying alkaline flocculation/flotation, paving the way towards the development of low-cost flocculant-free flotation harvesting processes.

TI  - Energy efficiency in fishing: Are magnetic devices useful for use in fishing vessels?
JO  - Applied Thermal Engineering
PY  - 2016
VL  - 94
IS  - NA
AB  - Sustainability is one of the main challenges of commercial fishing. Fuel represents almost 40\% of the total cost of a fishing vessel. The increase in the price of fuel over the last decade, together with the volatility and fluctuation in the price for a barrel of crude oil, makes fuel costs one of the main concerns of shipowners. As a response, different initiatives have been undertaken, with the aim to reduce such fuel dependency. The present contribution presents the feasibility study of the use of different magnetic devices for fuel treatment, in order to improve the energy efficiency of fishing vessels and reduce exhaust emissions. According to manufacturers, fuel treatment devices provide three effects: reduction in fuel consumption; reduction in exhaust gas emissions; and improvement of engine performance by reducing maintenance costs. Three independent magnetic devices have been mounted and tested on three different 4 stroke compression ignition diesel engines. The first device was tested in an engine located on a test bench; it was operated under controlled laboratory conditions. The second, installed on board a trawler fishing vessel operating in the Mediterranean Sea; and the third, on board a representative vessel of the trolling fishing fleet operating in the Bay of Biscay and Atlantic Ocean. In all cases, the potential fuel-saving (similar to 2\%) and exhaust gas emissions (similar to 0.6\%) reduction was lower than expected by manufacturers. The aim of this contribution is to provide ship-owners with scientific knowledge to make informed decisions, when investing in energy-saving technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes a distributionally robust economic dispatch model with considering the operation of MTDC. The power output of a wind farm is a random variable and assumed to follow an unknown probability distribution. The proposed model aims to seek the optimal economic dispatch decision under the worst-case probability distribution. Although the power equations for MTDC are nonlinear, we obtain a linear approximation by linearizing them around the nominal voltage. We propose a method to transform the proposed model to a linear model and it can be solved efficiently. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydrokinetic turbines (THK) convert kinetic energy from rivers, tidal currents, and waves into mechanical work that then, can be converted to electrical energy. An important aspect of hydrokinetic technology is the relationship between design simplicity, reliability, and system costs because represent significant differences compared to other renewable technologies. The blades of hydrokinetic energy converters in the current are very important since have a higher impact on the turbine performance and they are the components more expensive of the turbine. Aerodynamics profile shapes interact with the blades and it generated stresses and cause problems that can have a devastating impact in all the system. This study was made by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA). Pressure, stress and safety factor about three blades with different profiles (Eppler E817, NREL S802 y NACA 4412) were evaluated. Three different materials were used for each blade (stainless steel, aluminium and low-density polyethylene). The studied materials can be selected to build the blades due to their stiffness, hydrodynamic strength, corrosion, erosion resistance and low weight, being the aluminium the one that presents the best balance of desirable properties.

JO  - International Journal Of Environmental Research And Public Health
PY  - 2020
VL  - 17
IS  - 22
AB  - Seaportsâ€™ energy strategy should rely on the use of renewable energy. Presently, the share of renewable energy used by many of the ports worldwide is negligible. Some initiatives are in the process of implementation to produce some of the energy used by the Port of Valencia, one the largest ports in the Mediterranean Basin. Among these initiatives, a photovoltaic plant with an installed capacity of 5.5 MW is under a tendering process and the assessment studies for the deployment of three to five windmills are close to being finished. However, this is not enough to make it a â€œzero emissions portâ€ as some of the energy demand would still be covered by fossil fuels. Therefore, we should consider clean alternative energy sources. This article analyses the wave energy resources in the surroundings of the Port of Valencia using a 7-year series of data obtained from numerical modelling (forecast). The spatial distribution of wave power is analysed using data from 3 SIMAR points at Valencia Bay and is compared to the data obtained by the Valencia Buoy I (removed in 2005). The obtained results are used to estimate the power matrices and the average energy output of two wave energy converters suitable to be integrated into the portâ€™s infrastructure. Finally, the wave energy convertersâ€™ production is compared to the average amount of energy that is forecast to be obtained from other renewable sources such as solar and wind. Due to the nature of the Gulfâ€™s wave climate (mostly low waves), the main conclusion is that the energy obtainable from the waves in the Valencia Gulf will be in correlation with such climate. However, when dealing with great energy consumers every source of production is worthwhile and further research is needed to optimize the production of energy from renewable sources and its use in an industrial environment such as ports.

TI  - The Flagship South West Hub Project: Approach towards developing a green-field industrial scale CCS project in Western Australia
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2014
VL  - 63
IS  - NA
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a potential stepping stone to maintaining energy security while reducing the carbon footprint of Australia's energy sources. CCS, which involves capturing carbon dioxide that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere and injecting it to be stored in deep geological formations, is the only technology available to make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions while still using fossil fuels and much of today's energy infrastructure. At a State level, the Western Australian Greenhouse Strategy incorporates CCS and is helping to address the need for a long-term commitment to climate change and cleaner energy. The Government of Western Australia Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP) commenced investigating a site near large CO2 emission sources (the industrial centres of Kwinana and Collie in South-West Western Australia) in 2007 and developed the South West Hub (SW Hub) project concept in 2009 with the support of local industrial partners in the form of a Joint Venture (JV). The project was designated an ``Australian Flagship{''} project in 2011 and has received substantial funding and support from the Australian Federal Government, the Western Australia (WA) State Government and industry. The project has concurrently considered the various aspects required for an industrial scale development. The DMP has launched the technical investigations required to build confidence in the site and in parallel moved to amend the WA State Petroleum and Geothermal Legislation to include onshore geological storage of greenhouse gases. This is expected to pass in 2014-15, following which acreage release can occur. The ongoing and planned technical and exploration well drilling work is thus classified under the pre-competitive data acquisition phase and will allow the regulators to have comprehensive data packages to support tenement releases for CCS in the future. Community engagement has been given great importance, a formal strategy developed, workshops held and a ``Carbon-Kids{''} program launched in local schools. New geological data has been gathered through targeted 2D seismic lines and a deep exploration well. Technical uncertainties have been catalogued and the next phase of pre-competitive data acquisition is now under planning with 3D seismic (recently acquired) and several wells targeted at reducing these uncertainties. This will increase confidence in the storage concept and the fundamental performance factors of capacity, injectivity and especially containment as the area does not appear to have a large regional seal. Geological studies have indicated that the Lesueur Sandstone can potentially store between 200-260 Mt of CO2 over 40 years with residual trapping being the principal containment mechanism. Very significant technical work has supported this development through a range of research projects launched under the auspices of the Australian National Low Emissions Coal Research and Development program (ANLEC R\&D). The DMP is managing the SW Hub project in a stage-gated way with each investment phase progressing only when sufficient technical confidence justifies doing so. Industry, through a joint venture (JV), is aligning the capture programs of the industrial partners with feasibility studies and possible pipeline routes so that a comprehensive project work program can be tabled to acquire property rights under the new legislation. The SW Hub Project has faced (and continues to face) numerous technical, organisational, community and financial challenges. In overcoming these, a rich base of experience has been created. There are currently no CO2 storage projects (research, pilot or industrial) worldwide that focus on residual trapping mechanisms for primary containment and the SW Hub Project will potentially allow many more sites to be considered for storage as it develops and shares its research. The paper will elaborate on the importance of good processes, long term planning, extensive stakeholder management supported by a robust technical program as a viable blue-print for developing a green-field industrial scale CCS project.

AB  - The increase in CO2 in the air has caused global warming, the impact of which is felt by everyone in the world. One way to control climate change is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by maintaining the integrity of natural forests and increasing the density of trees outside the forest. Mangrove forests have a role as absorbers of CO2 from the air, and save more carbon than most tropical rainforests. The purpose of this study was to determine the biomass, stock carbon and CO2 uptake of mangrove Sonneratia alba in the Passo coastal waters, Inner Ambon Bay. Sampling of mangrove S. albaby belt transect method with a belt width of 10 m. Data collected included the number of trees, diameter (DBH) and area of observation. Biomass analysis and carbon content of S. albatrees were carried out in a nondestructive way (without damaging plants), which was using biomass estimation allometric equations. Carbon (CO2) uptakein S. alba is 564.48 tons.ha-1 which is stored on above of the ground at 111.50 tons.ha-1 and below the ground at 42.31 tons.ha-1. Total stock carbon of 153.81 tons.ha-1 were converted from total biomass of 327.26 tons.ha-1. High carbon sequestration and storage is supported by high biomass and high biomass is supported by a high number and diameter of trees. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - For more than a century, conventional marine vessels spatter the atmosphere with CO2 emissions and detrimental particles when operated by diesel motors/generators. Fuel cells have recently emerged as one of the most promising emission-free technologies for the electrification of ship propulsion systems. In fuel cell-based ship electrification, the entire marine power system is viewed as a direct current (DC) microgrid (MG) with constant power loads (CPLs). A challenge of such settings is how to stabilize the voltages and currents of the ship's grid. In this paper, we propose a new modified backstepping controller to stabilize the MG voltage and currents. Finally, to study the performance and efficiency of our proposal, we run an experiment simulation using dSPACE real-time emulator.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 24
IS  - 1
AB  - Global mangrove deforestation has resulted in substantial CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, but the extent of emissions from soil organic carbon (C) loss remains difficult to assess. Here, we sampled five intact and five deforested mangrove plots from Tsimipaika Bay, Madagascar, to examine the loss of soil C in the 10 years since deforestation. We estimated tree biomass and analyzed grain size, Pb-210 activities, organic C and total nitrogen (N) and their stable isotopes in soils as well as dissolved organic C in surface waters. Deforested soils revealed evidence of disturbance in the upper 14 g cm(-2) (similar to 40 cm) when compared to reference intact soils, indicated by lower porosity, higher dry bulk density, an order of magnitude higher soil mixing and loss of C and N despite no significant soil erosion. Although C loss from biomass was unequivocal and was estimated at 130 Mg C ha(-1), the C loss from soils was more difficult to assess given the large heterogeneity of intact forest soils. We estimated that the loss of C due to mangrove clearing and soil exposure over 10 years was equivalent to about 20\% of the upper meter soil C stock, and about 45\% of the C stock accumulated during the last century. Soil C loss rate was 4.5 times higher than the C sequestration rate in reference intact soils. These results emphasize the importance of mangrove conservation for CO2 emissions mitigation, as they suggest that deforestation-C losses will take substantially longer to offset with mangrove restoration.

AB  - Ship owners should comply with the forthcoming IMO legislations that mandates a reduction of ship emissions of at least 40% by 2030 compared with the 2008 baseline. However, it is unlikely that the shipping industry will be able to achieve its 2030 and 2050 emission reduction targets relying only on existing vessel technologies. Hence, the required green ship technologies that relate to industrial digitalization and AI applications should be utilized onboard vessels to achieve these emission reduction targets. This study proposes to analyze a hybrid engine-propeller combinator diagram from both theoretical calculations, i.e. from the vessel hull design, as well as data driven calculations, i.e. from ship performance and navigation data sets, to compare their performance in a single model framework. That would consist of various machine learning applications to create AI. It is expected that such combinations will support to understand the variations among system-model uncertainties in vessels and ship systems as a system of systems and that can also support industrial digitalization in shipping. Furthermore, the hybrid engine-propeller combinator diagram can be utilized to establish the basis for advanced data analytics that will be used to identify optimal vessel navigation and ship system operational conditions.

TI  - Optimal strategies of deployment of far offshore co-located wind-wave energy farms
JO  - Energy Conversion And Management
PY  - 2022
VL  - 251
IS  - NA
AB  - The most profitable offshore energy resources are usually found away from the coast. Nevertheless, the accessibility and grid integration in those areas are more complicated. To avoid this problematic, large scale hydrogen production is being promoted for far offshore applications. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the ability of wave energy converters to maximize hydrogen production in hybrid wind and wave far offshore farms. To that end, wind and wave resource data are obtained from ERA5 for different locations in the Atlantic ocean and a Maximum Covariance Analysis is proposed for the selection of the most representative locations. Furthermore, the suitability of different sized wave energy converters for auxiliary hydrogen production in the far offshore wind farms is also analysed. On that account, the hydrodynamic parameters of the oscillating bodies are obtained via simulations with a Boundary Element Method based code and their operation is modelled using the software tool Matlab. The combination of both methodologies enables to perform a realistic assessment of the contribution of the wave energy converters to the hydrogen generation of an hybrid energy farm, especially during those periods when the wind turbines would be stopped due to the variability of the wind. The obtained results show a considerable hydrogen generation capacity of the wave energy converters, up to 6.28\% of the wind based generation, which could remarkably improve the efficiency of the far offshore farm and bring important economical profit. Wave energy converters are observed to be most profitable in those farms with low covariance between wind and waves, where the disconnection times of the wind turbines are prone to be more prolonged but the wave energy is still usable. In such cases, a maximum of 101.12 h of equivalent rated production of the wind turbine has been calculated to be recovered by the wave energy converters.

AB  - Recently, the development of renewable energy resources has increased significantly. In particular, hybrid power combines multiple renewable resources and the next generation of systems with diverse micro-controllers and sensors has become a common trend. Since the hybrid electric power generation systems are usually located remotely and have various micro-controllers and sensors to be acquired and processed, a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system is required to monitor them remotely and control the data from the various sensors. The SCADA system collects data from distributed sensors to provide real time information for controlling micro-controllers of single or multiple turbines. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of the SCADA which is an integral part of energy operation for a standalone offshore wave-wind hybrid power generation system. The hybrid power generation system has four 2 MW-class wind turbines and twenty-four 100 KW-class wave force generators. The SCADA system is designed based on IEC61850 which is an international standard for vendor-agnostic engineering of the configuration of Intelligent Electronic Devices for electrical substation automation systems for communicating with each generator. We also show that the designed SCADA system is executed properly according to the command of the transmission system's operator in a simulation-based testing environment. Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The contemporary coastal ocean, characterized by abundant nutrients and high primary productivity, is generally seen as a significant CO2 sink at the global scale. However, mechanistic understanding of the coastal ocean carbon cycle remains limited, leading to the unanswered question of why some coastal systems are sources while others are sinks of atmospheric CO2. Here we proposed a distinct physical-biogeochemical setting, Ocean-dominated Margin (OceMar), in order for better shaping the concept of the coastal ocean carbon study. OceMars, in contrast to previously recognized River-dominated Ocean Margins, are characterized by dynamic interactions with the open ocean, which may provide nonlocal CO2 sources thereby modulating the CO2 fluxes in OceMars. Using the basin areas of the largest marginal seas of the Pacific and the Atlantic, the South China Sea and the Caribbean Sea as examples of OceMars, we demonstrated that such external CO2 sources controlled the CO2 fluxes.

TI  - The supervision and multi-sectoral guarantee mechanism of the global marine sulphur limit-assessment from Chinese shipping industry
JO  - Frontiers In Marine Science
PY  - 2022
VL  - 9
IS  - NA
AB  - To significantly reduce sulfur oxides emissions from fossil fuel-powered ships, reduce air pollution in ports and slow ocean acidification, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has imposed the new 0.50\%m/m limit (reduced from 3.50\%m/m in the past) on sulphur in ships' fuel oil. This has given rise to a host of issues regarding fuel replenishment operations, safe operation management, maritime regulation, and coordinated governance of air and climate. In response to ocean acidification and climate change, regulations on the use of low-sulfur oil or alternative fuels by ships greatly reduce sulfur oxide emissions, but have no significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, the refining process for low-sulfur fuels and the use of the gas cleaning system on ships both increase energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. To ensure the decarbonization process of shipping industry, there is an urgent need for a conceptual change in global ocean governance so as to promote the coordinated governance of air pollution and climate change. China's conception of ``a maritime community with a shared future{''} provides a new model for global ocean governance. The Chinese government has formulated regulations at different levels to promote the coordinated management of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Regarding supervision of sulfur oxide emissions from ships, this study proposes to build a multi-department collaborative supervision mechanism from marine fuel life cycle to enhance sulfur oxide monitoring and risk control capabilities. Specific measures of the proposed supervision mechanism include: the joint supervision of compliant fuel supply, the compliant fuel information disclosure platform, a joint law enforcement mechanism for atmospheric pollution, the ability of intelligent ship exhaust monitoring, and the construction of port power infrastructure.

PY  - 2020

AB  - Marine diesel engine is widely used in merchant ships as a propulsion system. The wasted heat of the diesel engines is one of the main drawbacks in this system. The aim of this paper is to recover this wasted heat to be used in designing combined heat and power plant. A bulk carrier WADI SAFAGA has been investigated as a case study. Power and electricity from Supercritical Organic Rankine Cycle will be produced as wasted heat recovery of the main engine. Maximum power, thermal efficiency and specific fuel consumption have been investigated according to the change of the evaporating pressure of organic fluid from 50 bar to 75 bar with increment of 5 bar. Heat exchangers must be redesigned due to the replacement of cooling water by refrigerant (R34a and R245fa). Also, parametric and economic studies will be taken into account. A comparison between diesel generator and SORC generator will be studied from economic and weight dimensions together with the specific power of generator point of view. The results showed that using SORC with R134a at working pressure of 50 bar have a satisfied performance with respect to the saving in specific fuel consumption, lubrication oil and cooling water. In addition, replacing three diesel generators by one SORC generator would decrease the weight by 12 tons, and would also decrease fuel consumption by 2.1 ton/day, shrinking the heat exchangers size, specific fuel consumption was decreased by 61 g/kW-h. Finally, the wasted heat of the main engine will decrease by 18%. Â© 2020 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University

TI  - Integrated Wide-Area Backup Protection Algorithm During Stressed Power System Condition in Presence of Wind Farm
JO  - Arabian Journal For Science And Engineering
PY  - 2021
VL  - 46
IS  - 10
AB  - Stressed power system conditions such as power swing, voltage instability and load encroachment may influence the secure operation of conventional backup protection at their third zone (zone 3). In this paper, a new integrated backup protection algorithm for distance relay is proposed based on wide-area measurements to distinguish the fault-stress conditions in the presence of offshore wind farm (WF). Presence of WF creates problem for distance relay due to varying wind speed and wide fluctuations in voltage and current signal during fault condition. In this work, two criteria are proposed to analyze and to identify the events. The first criterion compares the positive-sequence bus voltages in order to identify the faulty bus. According to second criterion, the absolute positive-sequence impedance angle difference between the lines connected to that faulty bus is computed to identify the faulty line. Numerous test cases with the WSCC 3-machine, 9-bus and IEEE 39 bus power system models have been simulated using EMTDC/PSCAD software. Results for different fault cases, power swing, load encroachment and voltage instability, and various non-fault cases like capacitor switching, demonstrate the efficacy of the wide-area backup protection scheme. Comparative assessment reports with the existing methods are also presented. Â© 2021, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

IS  - NA
AB  - The maritime industry is becoming increasingly aware of the global environmental impact of ships and is being forced, by international legislation, to gradually reduce its emissions. International Maritime Organization conventions and energy efficiency standards set challenges to shipping sector, to ship owners and ship designers, and to offer propulsion concepts that will effectively reduce or completely eliminate emission rates and increase energy efficiency with acceptable technological costs and adjustment time. New concepts include environmental-friendly fuels in existing propulsion architecture, hybrid propulsion, and all-electric propulsion architecture with the possible application of renewable energy sources, which are reviewed in this paper. Each concept has advantages and disadvantages regarding adjustment time, implementation cost and energy storage system capacity. One of the main disadvantages for complete replacement of conventional propulsion systems is the limited energy storage capacity of existing storage devices, which would decrease the operational ability of the shipping sector as a cheap transportation solution on the global market. Such problems and unsolved environmental issues regarding the production and recycling of energy storage devices are highlighted in this paper and must be further developed. The main motivation for the paper's work is to offer a detailed review of possible solutions for ship propulsion and to offer direction for further research. This is obtained by applying a literature review method to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each proposed solution. The results are discussed in the last section of the paper with the final conclusion that the internal combustion engines will not be completely replaced in the shipping sector in terms of the next few decades but will be able to use environmental-friendly fuels or fuels without a global carbon footprint. This conclusion is the result of analyzing especially large ocean-going vessels with very strong internal combustion engines. Such high power and energy demand are not very easy to be replaced with alternative energy sources or with all-electric ship solution without decreasing all other advantages of merchant shipping sector. Forecasts of ambitious decarbonization scenarios predict wide usage of carbon-neutral fuels in the late 2030s or mid-2040s and Green House Gases reduction (in the range between 50\% and 100\%) in 2050, which can be obtained by using enviromental-friendly fuels in existing infrastructure. It is still hard to identify which carbon-neutral fuel will be dominant, but e-ammonia, blue ammonia, bio-methanol, and hydrogen are the most promising carbon-neutral fuels in the decarbonization path.

AB  - International shipping is currently at a crossroads. The decision of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in April 2018 to adopt an Initial Strategy so as to achieve by 2050 a reduction of at least 50% in maritime greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions vis-Ã -vis 2008 levels epitomizes the last among a series of recent developments as regards sustainable shipping. It also sets the scene on what may happen in the future. Even though many experts and industry circles believe that the IMO decision is in line with the COP21 climate change agreement in Paris in 2015, others disagree, either on the ground that the target is not ambitious enough, or on the ground that no clear pathway to reach the target is currently visible. This book takes a cross-disciplinary view of the various dimensions of the maritime transportation sustainability problem. â€œCross-disciplinaryâ€ means that a variety of angles are used to examine the book topics, and these mainly include the technological angle, the economics angle, the logistics angle, and the environmental angle. The book reviews models that can be used to evaluate decisions, policy alternatives and tradeoffs. For sustainable shipping, a spectrum of technical, logistics-based and market based measures are being contemplated. All may have important side-effects as regards the economics and logistics of the maritime supply chain, including ports and hinterland connections. The objective to attain an acceptable environmental performance, while at the same time respecting traditional economic performance criteria so that shipping remains viable, is and is likely to be a central goal for both industry and policy-makers in the years ahead. At the same time, policy fragmentation is likely to create distortions of competition and sub-optimal solutions. This book attempts to address these issues and identify better solutions. Sustainable Shipping: A Cross-Disciplinary Viewincludes chapters that cover many relevant topics. These include a general view of maritime transport sustainability, green ship technologies, information and communication technologies (ICTs) for sustainable shipping, green tramp ship routing and scheduling, green liner network design and speed optimization. Market based measures, oil pollution, ship recycling, sulphur emissions, ballast water management, alternative fuels and green ports are also covered. The book concludes by discussing prospects for the future, with a focus on the IMO Initial Strategy. Â© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - In light of the International Maritime Organization guidelines, the new Regulation of the European Union urges shipping companies to set up a system for monitoring, reporting and verification of CO2 emissions based on ship fuel consumption. However, in nowadays market, there is a lack of techniques for fuel consumption monitoring that can be adopted in a real environment. The proposed procedure overcomes the use of Speed-Power curves, which are commonly utilized in the Naval Architecture, by means of a multiple linear regression model that exploits the navigation information usually available in modern ships. This procedure can be used both to alert technical management of a shipping company for anomalous fuel consumption and to quantify the fuel consumption reduction connected with any specific policy adopted to improve energy efficiency. Therefore, this can be particularly profitable for shipping companies and operators in order to claim for carbon credits. The proposed approach is currently implemented by the Energy Saving Technical Department of the Grimaldi Group on a Ro-Ro Pax ship. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Minimizing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Ships Using a Pareto Multi-Objective Optimization Approach
JO  - Polish Maritime Research
PY  - 2021
VL  - 28
IS  - 2
AB  - To confront climate change, decarbonization strategies must change the global economy. According to statements made as part of the European Green Deal, maritime transport should also become drastically less polluting. As a result, the price of transport must reflect the impact it has on the environment and on health. In such a framework, the purpose of this paper is to suggest a novel method for minimizing emissions from ships, based on so-called Pareto multi-objective optimization. For a given voyage by a ship, the problem is to minimize emissions on the one hand and minimize fuel consumption or passage time on the other. Minimizing emissions is considered as the preferred objective. Therefore, the objective of minimizing fuel consumption or passage time needs to be reformulated as a constraint. Solving such a problem consists of finding most favourable path and speed for the ship and satisfying the optimization criteria. Relatively new systems such as hybrid diesel-electric systems have the potential to offer significant emissions benefits. A hybrid power supply utilizes the maximum efficiency of the direct mechanical drive and the flexibility of a combination of combustion power from the prime mover and stored power from energy storage from an electrical supply, at part load and overload. A new report by the American Bureau of Shipping suggests that maritime transport is likely to meet the International Maritime Organization's target by 2030, solely by using current technology and operational measures. However, this would not be enough to attain the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 2050 by at least 50% compared to 2008. New technologies and operational methods must be applied.

AB  - Shipping emissions have significant influence on atmospheric environment as well as human health, especially in coastal areas and the harbor districts. However, the contribution of shipping emissions on the environment in China still need to be clarified especially based on measurement data, with the large number ownership of vessels and the rapid developments of ports, international trade and shipbuilding industry. Pollutants in the gaseous phase (carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, total volatile organic compounds) and particle phase (particulate matter, organic carbon, elemental carbon, sulfates, nitrate, ammonia, metals) in the exhaust from three different diesel engine power offshore vessels in China were measured in this study. Concentrations, fuel-based and power-based emissions factors for various operating modes as well as the impact of engine speed on emissions were determined. Observed concentrations and emissions factors for carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, total volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter were higher for the low engine power vessel than for the two higher engine power vessels. Fuel-based average emissions factors for all pollutants except sulfur dioxide in the low engine power engineering vessel were significantly higher than that of the previous studies, while for the two higher engine power vessels, the fuel-based average emissions factors for all pollutants were comparable to the results of the previous studies. The fuel-based average emissions factor for nitrogen oxides for the small engine power vessel was more than twice the International Maritime Organization standard, while those for the other two vessels were below the standard. Emissions factors for all three vessels were significantly different during different operating modes. Organic carbon and elemental carbon were the main components of particulate matter, while water-soluble ions and elements were present in trace amounts. Best-fit engine speeds during actual operation should be based on both emissions factors and economic costs. Â© Author(s) 2015.

AB  - Maritime shipping currently emits 2.89\% of the world greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and it is estimated that the sector will reach the road transportation level by 2060. International environmental regulations push the industry to lower their GHG emissions, but the feasibility and viability of future green energy is uncertain. This paper presents a road towards green maritime shipping by proposing shore power, also known as cold ironing or alternative marine power, as a key measure to decarbonize the industry. Therefore, transition pathways and the available measures to decarbonize the industry are analyzed. A theoretical description of shore power along with a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis of the technology is discussed. The paper is also supported with a test case on a real bulk carrier to measure the score improvement of shore power on the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and the Carbon Intensity Index (CII). In summary, shore power can reduce GHG and air polluting emissions at ports right now and across the world. The case of study determined that shore power could improve CII by 7.8\% and policy modifications have been presented to include shore power in EEDI and EEXI calculations. Most of all, shore power can eliminate 100\% of emissions of ships at berth right now. Furthermore, shore power is a prime mover for the development of new maritime applications like hybridization and electrification. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

On one hand the transmission capacity of the power systems must be as high, as unplanned dynamics, caused by these infeeds, can be transported without producing system bottlenecks. Such dynamic energy transports occur sometimes over long distances and require operational coordination between different TSOs.

AB  - Direct drive motor systems for offshore wind turbines will improve reliability and reduce maintenance costs. This paper describes a real-time status evaluation model for offshore direct-drive wind turbines. This model integrates the correlation coefficient method, deterioration analyses and fuzzy synthetic evaluation. The correlation coefficient method determines the weights of various indexes. The deterioration analysis normalizes the indicator parameters. The bottom-up, step-by-step, multi-level fuzzy synthetic evaluation method assesses the status of each subsystem of the offshore direct-drive wind turbine. An analysis of online inspection data for a direct-drive wind turbine shows that the model results are consistent with real operational data. This model is helpful for managing routine operations and maintenance for offshore direct-drive wind turbines to improve the operational efficiency of offshore wind farms.

AB  - Ocean stores a huge amount of energy and ocean current energy can be a viable source in future. In this article, an axial marine current turbine has been optimized to enhance its power coefficient through numerical modeling. The blade pitch-angle and number of blades are the design parameters chosen for the analysis to find the optimal design. A commercial code for CFD simulations with in-house optimization code was used for the analysis. It was found that, changing the blade pitch-angle and reducing the number of blades can improve the turbine's coefficient of power. This is due to increase in lift and reduction of losses caused by turbulence near the downstream of the turbine. The article presents flow-simulation difficulties and characteristic curves to identify the differences between the actual and optimized turbine. The detailed flow physics is discussed and pictured in the post processed plots.

AB  - Maritime shipping is regarded as the most efficient mode of transport; however, its contribution to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and the health issues related to shipping activity near residential centers cannot be neglected. In recent years, the efforts of regulators, ship operators, and port authorities have led to actions for ship emissions reduction to improve shipping's environmental performance. This work builds on an activity-based methodology that allows the estimation of emissions and examines environmental effects of slow steaming, fuel regulations, near-port speed-reduction schemes, and cold ironing. Pollutant emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and black carbon are modeled. A linear programming model minimizes fuel consumption through speed differentiation on a shipping line's routes based on fuel costs and binding regulations in each segment of the journey. Although the examined emissions-reduction actions may have a positive regional environmental effect by cutting emissions, it Is possible that additional emissions arc generated elsewhere because of increased sailing speeds beyond regulated areas. Trade-offs between pollutants are observed for reduction actions that may have a positive effect on some emission species but at the same time result in additional particulate matter and black carbon emissions. The presented framework allows key actors to conduct comprehensive studies and design improved emissions reduction actions with fewer negative impacts in other areas.

To meet the emerging requirements of the power system with regard to voltage and frequency, controllers with extended features have been used that enable the control of the terminal voltage and the participation of large wind farms on system frequency control. The models of the wind turbine and the electrical machines together with the proposed control structure are integrated into a power system simulation environment. Then, the impact of planned off-shore wind farms on the transient stability performance of parallel operating conventional power plants and the bus voltage profile of the network during fault for alternative wind generator types are investigated. Additionally, the response of the wind farm to a major load change in a large multi-machine network is simulated and the results discussed. Â© 2003 IEEE.

TI  - Development of a CO2 specification for a CCS hub network
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2017
VL  - 114
IS  - NA
AB  - The CarbonNet Project (CarbonNet) has developed a preliminary CO2 specification for its carbon capture and storage (CCS) hub based network as part of its feasibility studies. This paper provides a summary of the approach CarbonNet used to develop the CO2 specification, focusing on the main elements of the specification and the trade-offs required between the capture, transport and storage components of the CCS project chain. CarbonNet is exploring the feasibility of a commercial scale CCS network delivering CO2 captured from a range of source projects in the Latrobe Valley of Victoria, Australia, which contains one of the world's largest brown coal deposits, to storage sites in the offshore Gippsland Basin, which has greater than 31 gigatonnes of CO2 storage potential. The CO2 captured from potential source projects will contain minor components which may affect the physical properties and phase envelope of the stream, impact environmental and regulatory requirements, set the transportation and storage design and influence the storage site capacity and geochemistry. The philosophy adopted by CarbonNet for the CO2 specification was a risk based approach to not discourage or prevent potential sources connecting to the network and to allow whole of project CCS costs to be minimised, not just the transport and storage elements. The CO2 specification developed from consideration of limitations imposed by the subsurface, pipeline design and health and safety, reviewing business as usual and technically achievable limits of potential source proponents and considering future acceptance of the proposed specification by targeted assessments. Trade-off studies were completed on the water content, operating pressure and purity requirements. Commercial considerations were reviewed for cost recovery of increased transport and storage costs associated with lower purity CO2 and/or high levels of specific minor components. The CarbonNet CO2 specification has a lower and upper bound for many components and the specification will be further refined to meet the requirements of regulators, design limitations and/or commercial arrangements between source proponents and the transport and storage owner during the next stage of the project.

TI  - Preliminary design of a fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain for a heavy-duty yard truck for port logistics
JO  - Energy Conversion And Management
PY  - 2021
VL  - 243
IS  - NA
AB  - The maritime transport and the port-logistic industry are key drivers of economic growth, although, they represent major contributors to climate change. In particular, maritime port facilities are typically located near cities or residential areas, thus having a significant direct environmental impact, in terms of air and water quality, as well as noise. The majority of the pollutant emissions in ports comes from cargo ships, and from all the related ports activities carried out by road vehicles. Therefore, a progressive reduction of the use of fossil fuels as a primary energy source for these vehicles and the promotion of cleaner powertrain alternatives is in order. The present study deals with the design of a new propulsion system for a heavy-duty vehicle for port applications. Specifically, this work aims at laying the foundations for the development of a benchmark industrial cargo-handling hydrogen-fueled vehicle to be used in real port operations. To this purpose, an on-field measurement campaign has been conducted to analyze the duty cycle of a commercial Diesel-engine yard truck currently used for terminal ports operations. The vehicle dynamics has been numerically modeled and validated against the acquired data, and the energy and power requirements for a plug-in fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain replacing the Diesel powertrain on the same vehicle have been evaluated. Finally, a preliminary design of the new powertrain and a rule-based energy management strategy have been proposed, and the electric energy and hydrogen consumptions required to achieve the target driving range for roll-on and roll-off operations have been estimated. The results are promising, showing that the hybrid electric vehicle is capable of achieving excellent energy performances, by means of an efficient use of the fuel cell. An overall amount of roughly 12 kg of hydrogen is estimated to be required to accomplish the most demanding port operation, and meet the target of 6 h of continuous operation. Also, the vehicle powertrain ensures an adequate all-electric range, which is between approximately 1 and 2 h depending on the specific port operation. Potentially, the hydrogen-fueled yard truck is expected to lead to several benefits, such as local zero emissions, powertrain noise elimination, reduction of the vehicle maintenance costs, improving of the energy management, and increasing of operational efficiency.

TI  - A New Self-Healing Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Polyurethane Coating and Its Application for Self-Powered Cathodic Protection
JO  - Acs Applied Materials \& Interfaces
PY  - 2022
VL  - 14
IS  - 8
AB  - With the increasing demand for carbon neutrality, the development of renewable and recycle green energy has attracted wide attention from researchers. A novel self-healing triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) was constructed by applying a linear silicone-modified polyurethane (PU) coating as a triboelectric layer, which was obtained by reacting hydroxypropyl silicone oil and hexamethylene diisocyanate under the catalysis of Sn. The linear self-healing coating as the friction electrode could effectively alleviate the damages of TENG devices during long-term energy harvesting. When the triboelectric layer of the TENG device shows abrasion, the broken silicone-modified polyurethane polymer chains would gradually be cross-linked again through hydrogen bonding to achieve a self-healing effect. The entire self- healing process of the friction coating could be completed in 30 min at room temperature. The PU-based self-healing TENG exhibits an evident and stable output performance with a short-circuit current of 31.9 mu A and output voltage of 517.5 V after multiple cutting-healing cycles, which could light 480 commercial LEDs. Besides, a self-powered cathodic protection system supplied by the self-healing TENG was constructed, which could transfer negative triboelectric charges to the protected metal surface to achieve an anti-corrosion effect by harvesting mechanical energy. Due to the self-healing characteristics of the TENG device as the power supply part, this intelligent system possesses great application potential in the long-term corrosion protection of multiple metal application industries, such as the marine industry.

TI  - Safety vs. Sustainability â€“ How Much Underpowering of Ships Is Acceptable?
JO  - Lecture Notes In Civil Engineering
PY  - 2021
VL  - 65 LNCE
IS  - NA
AB  - The present EEDI regulations have a strong impact on ship design. Especially for tankers and bulk carriers, the regulation results in the reduction of the installable main engine power. In 2020, the next EEDI reduction phase is put into force with the consequence that the main engine power of these ships will be reduced even further. The development helps to reduce emissions, especially greenhouse gases, but it puts challenges on ship safety, as the ship must still be maneuverable even in bad weather conditions. Recently, a grounding incident of a bulk carrier sea took place in the German Bight where the ship was dragging its anchor although the main engine was running at full speed. Numerical investigations of this accident showed that the environmental forces acting on the ship were larger than the sum of propeller and anchor forces. This incident was an excellent opportunity to investigate whether our existing numerical calculation methods are able to cope with such kind of incidents and whether it was possible to investigate the root cause of that particular grounding event. The paper gives an overview about the numerical investigations of the grounding event which address course keeping in heavy weather including anchor forces. Additionally, operational aspects of the main engine operation and the propulsion control systems are considered. The ship did not need to comply with the existing EEDI regulations. Therefore, the paper addresses also the effect of reduced main engine power on this particular incident, because it is obvious that reduced main engine power will make such incidents more probable, as limiting environmental conditions for a ship with less power will be less severe and therefore more probable.

TI  - Contrasting marine carbonate systems in two fjords in British Columbia, Canada: Seawater buffering capacity and the response to anthropogenic CO2 invasion
JO  - Plos One
PY  - 2020
VL  - 15
IS  - 9 September
AB  - The carbonate system in two contrasting fjords, Rivers Inlet and Bute Inlet, on the coast of British Columbia, Canada, was evaluated to characterize the mechanisms driving carbonate chemistry dynamics and assess the impact of anthropogenic carbon. Differences in the character of deep water exchange between these fjords were inferred from their degree of exposure to continental shelf water and their salinity relationships with total alkalinity and total dissolved inorganic carbon, which determined seawater buffering capacity. Seawater buffering capacity differed between fjords and resulted in distinct carbonate system characteristics with implications on calcium carbonate saturation states and sensitivity to increasing anthropogenic carbon inputs. Saturation states of both aragonite and calcite mineral phases of calcium carbonate were seasonally at or below saturation throughout the entire water column in Bute Inlet, while only aragonite was seasonally under-saturated in portions of the water column in Rivers Inlet. The mean annual saturation states of aragonite in Rivers Inlet and calcite in Bute Inlet deep water layers have declined to below saturation within the last several decades due to anthropogenic carbon accumulation, and similar declines to undersaturation are projected in their surface layers as anthropogenic carbon continues to accumulate. This study demonstrates that the degree of fjord water exposure to open shelf water influences the uptake and sensitivity to anthropogenic carbon through processes affecting seawater buffering capacity, and that reduced uptake but greater sensitivity occurs where distance to ocean source waters and freshwater dilution are greater.

JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2022
VL  - 248
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper performs an investigation of power performance and techno-economic performance of wave power farms in realistic wave climates, where hydrodynamic interaction and influence of control strategies employed by power take-off systems are fully considered in mathematical modeling and numerical analysis. This is of great significance for a commercial wave power farm operated in a specific sea site over a long time of years, as wave energy converters will encounter a wide range of sea states, which requires that associated power take-off systems of individual units must be controlled accordingly to maximize the converted energy and to reduce the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). To that end, a fully-coupled numerical model, where the power take-off systems of wave energy converters are coordinately controlled/tuned for each sea state by employing an optimal linear passive control strategy and an optimal active control strategy, respectively. Numerical results show that power performance and LCOE of wave power farms vary over wave climates, and machinery constraints of power take-off force must be considered. Globally coordinated control of wave power farms by employing a constrained optimal linear active control strategy yields a LCOE of 0.17 - 0.54 \$/kWh and increases the annual energy generation at least three times in specific wave climates of China, United States, Australia and Ireland.

TI  - All-DC offshore wind farms: When are they more cost-effective than AC designs?
JO  - Iet Renewable Power Generation
PY  - 2022
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The use of MVDC collector systems has been proposed as a way to reduce the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of offshore wind farms. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the conditions required for such all-DC wind farms to be cost-effective. A comprehensive LCOE analysis of two AC and two all-DC wind farm designs is performed, with sensitivity studies on wind farm size, distance from shore, collector voltage, and component costs. The results show that for MVDC-based wind farms to be more cost-effective than equivalent HVDC wind farms, the DC/DC converter cost must be less than 90% of the cost of an equivalent MMC, with a cost reduction of 25% for the DC platform. Alternatively, if cost reductions of 30% can be achieved for the DC platform, then the DC/DC converter can be the same cost as an equivalent MMC. For all-MVDC wind farms without HVDC conversion stage to have the lowest LCOE, the collector voltage must be increased, preferably to Â±100Â kV or above. The all-MVDC configuration can also become cost-effective if a reduction of more than 50% in the cable installation cost can be achieved, for example, through the simultaneous burial of multipleÂ cables.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The maritime industry is becoming increasingly aware of the global environmental impact of ships and is being forced, by international legislation, to gradually reduce its emissions. International Maritime Organization conventions and energy efficiency standards set challenges to shipping sector, to ship owners and ship designers, and to offer propulsion concepts that will effectively reduce or completely eliminate emission rates and increase energy efficiency with acceptable technological costs and adjustment time. New concepts include environmental-friendly fuels in existing propulsion architecture, hybrid propulsion, and all-electric propulsion architecture with the possible application of renewable energy sources, which are reviewed in this paper. Each concept has advantages and disadvantages regarding adjustment time, implementation cost and energy storage system capacity. One of the main disadvantages for complete replacement of conventional propulsion systems is the limited energy storage capacity of existing storage devices, which would decrease the operational ability of the shipping sector as a cheap transportation solution on the global market. Such problems and unsolved environmental issues regarding the production and recycling of energy storage devices are highlighted in this paper and must be further developed. The main motivation for the paper's work is to offer a detailed review of possible solutions for ship propulsion and to offer direction for further research. This is obtained by applying a literature review method to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each proposed solution. The results are discussed in the last section of the paper with the final conclusion that the internal combustion engines will not be completely replaced in the shipping sector in terms of the next few decades but will be able to use environmental-friendly fuels or fuels without a global carbon footprint. This conclusion is the result of analyzing especially large ocean-going vessels with very strong internal combustion engines. Such high power and energy demand are not very easy to be replaced with alternative energy sources or with all-electric ship solution without decreasing all other advantages of merchant shipping sector. Forecasts of ambitious decarbonization scenarios predict wide usage of carbon-neutral fuels in the late 2030s or mid-2040s and Green House Gases reduction (in the range between 50% and 100%) in 2050, which can be obtained by using enviromental-friendly fuels in existing infrastructure. It is still hard to identify which carbon-neutral fuel will be dominant, but e-ammonia, blue ammonia, bio-methanol, and hydrogen are the most promising carbon-neutral fuels in the decarbonization path.

TI  - Cost-effective IMTA: a comparison of the production efficiencies of mussels and seaweed
JO  - Journal Of Applied Phycology
PY  - 2014
VL  - 26
IS  - 2
AB  - This paper compares the biofilter capacity and cost-effectiveness of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and seaweed for use in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) based on experiences in Ireland and Denmark. This comparison shows that weight for weight, mussels are a better biofilter than seaweed with regard to the amount of nitrogen assimilated. Furthermore, in optimized systems, areal requirement for mussels is similar to the cultivation of the same tonnage (1,000 t) of seaweed (approximately 8 ha). The cost-effectiveness of a mussel biofilter is a,not sign11-30 kg(-1) nitrogen (N) removed based on various examples compared to production costs of a,not sign209-672 removed and a,not sign1,013 kg(-1) N removed, respectively, for Laminaria digitata and Alaria esculenta from extrapolated laboratory and field trials. However, commercial seaweed (Saccharina latissima) producers claim that production costs are less than a,not sign10-38 kg(-1) N removed. These up-scaled and commercial figures make the seaweed cost competitive to mussels for removal of nitrogen. Disadvantages such as predators (e.g. eider ducks) and biofouling should also be taken into account before choice of biofilter is made. These drawbacks can reduce overall biofilter capacity and biomass value as a consequence of biomass spoilage or loss. However, disadvantages may be mitigated by seasonal choice of cultivation and harvest times. Cultivation technologies and harvesting methods may be improved together with breeding to improve the cost-efficiency of the biofilter, especially in the newer European seaweed cultivation. Furthermore, upscaling of IMTA to commercial proportions, other than the Danish example, would allow more real data on production costs and revenues.

AB  - Coralline macroalgae are globally distributed rhodopyhtes that remove carbon from their immediate environment and transform it into carbonate sediments through the senescence of their calcified tissues. In this study, the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) stocks in the tissue of Jania adhaerens and sediments in Tanjung Adang Shoal, Johor were quantified for a 13-month study period. The detailed maps of the geographical distribution based on the spatial and temporal variations of biomass and CaCO3 were also assessed. The highest amount of biomass, CaCO3 and organic carbon (OC) stocks in the tissues showed the highest in May 2018 and May 2019. The biomass values ranged from 65 to 143 g DW mâˆ’2, which contained 53â€“147 g CaCO3 mâˆ’2 and 3â€“11 g OC mâˆ’2. These findings provided insights into the biogeochemical cycling of these inputs, which can be used to estimate the overall carbon budget of the macrophyte meadow. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Offshore wind energy is an essential component of the climate system and plays a crucial role in addressing climate change. India has a coastline of seven thousand kilometres and a National offshore wind energy policy; however, the installed capacity of offshore wind energy is yet to start, signalling the existence of significant barriers. The specific objective of this study is to develop a framework for identifying and categorizing the barriers to the growth of offshore wind energy in India. The study prioritizes these barriers using a multi-criteria decision-making approach and sensitivity analysis for robustness. Barriers listed in the technical category emerged through analysis as the significant barriers to the growth of offshore wind energy in India, which includes grid-connection challenges, inadequate technology, lack of servicing and maintenance facilities, inadequate testing and commissioning, cable installation challenges, lack of energy storage, and lack of offshore wind zones. Financial barriers are categorized as the second most crucial barrier: initial capital, credit accessibility, inadequate subsidies, power pricing scheme, immature offshore engineering market, insurance, and imperfect feed-in tariff mechanism. It is followed by social, institutional, geographical, and supply chain barriers. Regulatory and political barriers stand on the last rank and have the most negligible influence on offshore wind energy in India. Â© 2022

JO  - Ecosystems
PY  - 2018
VL  - 21
IS  - 7
AB  - Future increases in oceanic carbon dioxide concentrations (CO2(aq)) may provide a benefit to submerged plants by alleviating photosynthetic carbon limitation. However, other environmental factors (for example, nutrient availability) may alter how seagrasses respond to CO2(aq) by regulating the supply of additional resources required to support growth. Thus, questions remain in regard to how other factors influence CO2(aq) effects on submerged vegetation. This study factorially manipulated CO2(aq) and nutrient availability, in situ, within a subtropical seagrass bed for 350days, and examined treatment effects on leaf productivity, shoot density, above- and belowground biomass, nutrient content, carbohydrate storage, and sediment organic carbon (C-org). Clear, open-top chambers were used to replicate CO2(aq) forecasts for the year 2100, whereas nutrient availability was manipulated via sediment amendments of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer. We provide modest evidence of a CO2 effect, which increased seagrass aboveground biomass. CO2(aq) enrichment had no effect on nutrient content, carbohydrate storage, or sediment C-org content. Nutrient addition increased leaf productivity and leaf N content, however did not alter above- or belowground biomass, shoot density, carbohydrate storage, or C-org content. Treatment interactions were not significant, and thus NP availability did not influence seagrass responses to elevated CO2(aq). This study demonstrates that long-term carbon enrichment may alter the structure of shallow seagrass meadows, even in relatively nutrient-poor, oligotrophic systems.

AB  - Management of trees in agroecosystems such as agroforestry, ethnoforests, and trees outside forests can mitigate green house gas (GHG) emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. Agroforestry systems are a better climate change mitigation option than oceanic, and other terrestrial options because of the secondary environmental benefits such as helping to attain food security and secure land tenure in developing countries, increasing farm income, restoring and maintaining above-ground and below-ground biodiversity, corridors between protected forests, as CH4 sinks, maintaining watershed hydrology, and soil conservation. Agroforestry also mitigates the demand for wood and reduces pressure on natural forests. Promoting woodcarving industry facilitates long-term locking-up of carbon in carved wood and new sequestration through intensified tree growing. By making use of local knowledge, equity, livelihood security, trade and industry, can be supported. There is need to support development of suitable policies, assisted by robust country-wide scientific studies aimed at better understanding the potential of agroforestry and ethnoforestry for climate change mitigation and human well-being.

VL  - 56

AB  - Climate change and air pollution that are enormously impacted by ship emissions have become an intriguing issue, drawing consideration from the shipping industry. The shipâ€™s propulsion system is the main contributor to energy efficiency and ship emissions. This research paper presents a solution to this issue through propelling the ship by using a diesel-electric propulsion system instead of the conventional one. As a case study, a passenger ship is investigated. The results showed that the proposed electric propulsion system has lower emission rates than the conventional one by 10%, 21%, and 88% for Carbon dioxide, Nitrogen oxides and Sulfur dioxide emissions, respectively. From an energy efficiency point of view, the diesel-electric propulsion system enhances the energy efficiency and complies with the required International Maritime Organization (IMO) values, as actual energy efficiency is about 66%, 70%, 83%, and 95% of the required IMO values at baseline, Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3, respectively. From the economic point of view, the annual costs are $2.5 and $3.05 million for both diesel-electric and conventional propulsion systems, respectively. This shows that the annual cost of the diesel-electric option is less than that of the conventional by 22%. Â© 2022, Marine Technology Society Inc.. All rights reserved.

TI  - On Fatigue Damage Assessment for Offshore Support Structures with Tubular Joints
JO  - Energy Procedia
PY  - 2016
VL  - 94
IS  - NA
AB  - The hot spot stress approach is commonly used for fatigue lifetime estimation of tubular joints. The standard approach consists of the linear superposition of stress components from axial, in-plane, and out of plane action, leading to 8 hot spot stresses equally divided along the circumference of each tubular joint. The fatigue lifetime for a joint is calculated by accumulating the fatigue damage over several load cases. The fatigue damage used per load case is commonly the maximum fatigue damage out of the 8 hot spots. In this study, another approach has been evaluated. Fatigue lifetime is estimated by accumulation of fatigue damage over load cases for each hot spot individually, instead of taking the maximum out of the 8 hot spots. The proposed approach is compared with the commonly used approach using a generic lattice type support structure for offshore wind turbines. In addition, the number of hot spots along the circumference of the joint is increased to 32 points in order to study the influence on the fatigue lifetime estimation. Results show a difference in the fatigue lifetime estimation for individual joints up to 26% when using the proposed approach for estimating the fatigue lifetime. Furthermore, it is shown that the consideration of 32 points along the circumference of tubular joints lead to more precise fatigue damage. Differences up to 11% were detected. Â© 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Importance of seagrass as a carbon source for heterotrophic bacteria in a subtropical estuary (Florida Bay)
JO  - Estuarine Coastal And Shelf Science
PY  - 2009
VL  - 85
IS  - 3
AB  - A stable carbon isotope approach was taken to identify potential organic matter sources incorporated into biomass by the heterotrophic bacterial community of Florida Bay. a subtropical estuary with a recent history of seagrass loss and phytoplankton blooms. To gain a more complete understanding of bacterial carbon cycling in seagrass estuaries, this study focused on the importance of seagrass-derived organic matter to pelagic, seagrass epiphytic, and sediment surface bacteria. Particulate organic matter (POM), seagrass epiphytic, seagrass (Thalassia testudinum) leaf, and sediment surface samples were collected from four Florida Bay locations with historically different organic matter inputs, macrophyte densities, and primary productivities. Bulk (observed and those reported previously) and compound-specific bacterial fatty acid delta C-13 values were used to determine important carbon sources to the estuary and benthic and pelagic heterotrophic bacteria. The delta C-13 values of T testudinum green leaves with epiphytes removed ranged from -9.9 to -6.9 parts per thousand. Thalassia testudinum delta C-13 values were significant more enriched in C-13 than POM, epiphytic, and sediment samples, which ranged from -16.4 to -13.5, -16.2 to -9.6, and -16.7 to -11.0 parts per thousand, respectively. Bacterial fatty acid delta C-13 values (measured for br14:0, 15:0, 05:0, a15:0, br17:0, and 17:0) ranged from -25.5 to -8.2 parts per thousand. Assuming a -3 parts per thousand carbon source fractionation from fatty acid to whole bacteria, pelagic, epiphytic, and sediment bacterial delta C-13 Values were generally more depleted in C-13 than T testudinum delta C-13 values, more enriched in C-13 than reported delta C-13 values for mangroves, and similar to reported delta C-13 values for algae. Isosource mixing model results indicated that organic matter derived from T testudinum was incorporated by both benthic and pelagic bacterial communities, where 13-67\% of bacterial delta C-13 values could arise from consumption of seagrass-derived organic matter. The IsoSource model, however, failed to discriminate clearly the fraction of algal (0-86\%) and mangrove (0-42\%) organic matter incorporated by bacterial communities. These results indicate that pelagic, epiphytic, and sediment surface bacteria consumed organic matter from a variety of sources. Bacterial communities incorporated consistently seagrass-derived organic matter, the dominant macrophyte in Florida Bay, but seagrass delta C-13 values alone could not account fully for bacterial delta C-13 values.

TI  - Prospects of cold ironing as an emissions reduction option
JO  - Transportation Research Part A: Policy And Practice
PY  - 2019
VL  - 119
IS  - NA
AB  - Cold ironing is the process of providing shorepower to cover the energy demands of ships calling at ports. This technological solution can eliminate the emissions of auxiliary engines at berth, resulting in a global reduction of emissions if the grid powering the ships is an environmentally friendly energy source. This paper conducts a literature review of recent academic work in the field and presents the status of this technology worldwide and the current barriers for its further implementation. The use of cold ironing is mandatory in Californian ports for ship operators and as a result terminal and ship operators were required to invest in this technology. In Europe, all ports will be required to have cold ironing provision by the end of 2025. Other regulations that target local emissions such as Emission Control Areas can have a significant impact on whether cold ironing is used in the future as a potential compliance solution. This paper constructs a quantitative framework for the examination of the technology considering all stakeholders. The role of regulation is shown to be critical for the further adoption of this technology. Illustrative case studies are presented that consider the perspective of ship operators of various ship types, and terminal operators that opt to invest in shorepower facilities. The results of the case studies show that for medium and high fuel price scenarios there is economic motivation for ship operators to use cold ironing. For the port, the cost per abated ton of pollutants is much lower than current estimates of the external costs of pollutants. Therefore, shorepower may be a viable emissions reduction option for the maritime sector, provided that regulatory bodies assist the further adoption of the technology from ship operators and ports. The methodology can be useful to port and ship operators in examining the benefits of using cold ironing as an emissions reduction action. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

JO  - Frontiers In Marine Science

VL  - 9
IS  - NA
AB  - Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (Alk(T)) fluxes to the nearshore ocean can directly impact the rates of primary production, coral reef formation, coastal ocean acidification, and continental shelf ecology. Current understanding of the transformations that DIC and Alk(T) undergo as they move from land to sea are limited, leading to difficulties in estimating future DIC and Alk(T) export that may be altered under a changing climate. While much research has focused on carbon fluxes in carbon-rich mangroves and coastal wetlands, DIC and Alk(T) transformations and distributions in sandy beach aquifers, which are comparatively carbon-poor, have not been studied as extensively. We monitored DIC and Alk(T) concentrations in a sandy beach system over six sampling events spanning two years. Substantial changes to DIC and Alk(T) occurred along subsurface flowpaths due to aerobic respiration and anoxic reactions, resulting in an additional mean flux to the ocean of 191 and 134 mmol/d per meter length of shoreline, respectively. The chemical alterations occurred within the saltwater-freshwater mixing zone beneath the beach surface. Both aerobic and anaerobic reactions actively contributed to DIC and Alk(T) production within the system, as indicated by DIC: Alk(T) and dDIC:dAlk(T) ratios relative to the theoretical dilution line. The work indicates that beach aquifers support active transformation of inorganic carbon and highlights a potentially important and overlooked source of DIC and Alk(T) to coastal systems.

AB  - Maintenance is essential in keeping wind energy assets operating efficiently. With the development of advanced condition monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics, condition-based maintenance has attracted much attention in the offshore wind industry in recent years. This paper models various maintenance activities and their impacts on the degradation and performance of offshore wind turbine components. An integrated maintenance strategy of corrective maintenance, imperfect time-based preventive maintenance and condition-based maintenance is proposed and compared with other traditional maintenance strategies. A maintenance simulation programme is developed to simulate the degradation and maintenance of offshore wind turbines and estimate their performance. A case study on a 10-MW offshore wind turbine (OWT) is presented to analyse the performance of different maintenance strategies. The simulation results reveal that the proposed strategy not only reduces the total maintenance cost but also improves the energy generation by reducing the total downtime and expected energy not supplied. Furthermore, the proposed maintenance strategy is optimised to find the best degradation threshold and balance the trade-off between the use of condition-based maintenance and other maintenance activities.

JO  - Journal Of Marine Science And Engineering
PY  - 2020
VL  - 8
IS  - 8
AB  - Hybrid propulsion and using liquefied natural gas (LNG) as the alternative fuel have been applied on automobiles and some small ships, but research investigating the fuel consumption and emissions over the total voyage of ocean-going cargo ships with a hybrid propulsion and different fuels is limited. This paper tries to fill the knowledge gap by investigating the influence of the ship mission profile, propulsion modes and effects of different fuels on the fuel consumption and emissions of the ship over the whole voyage, including transit in open sea and manoeuvring in close-to-port areas. Results show that propulsion control and electric power generation modes have a notable influence on the ship's fuel consumption and emissions during the voyage. During close-to-port manoeuvres, propelling the ship in power-take-in (PTI) mode and generating the electric power by auxiliary engines rather than the main engine will reduce the local NOx and HC (hydrocarbons) emissions significantly. Sailing the ship on LNG will reduce the fuel consumption, CO2 and NOx emissions notably while producing higher HC emissions than traditional fuels. The hybridisation of the ship propulsion and using LNG together with ship voyage optimisation, considering the ship mission, ship operations and sea conditions, will improve the ship's fuel consumption and emissions over the whole voyage significantly.

TI  - Long-term artificial seawater irrigation as a sustainable environmental management strategy for abandoned solar salt works: The case study of Agua Amarga salt marsh (SE Spain)
JO  - Catena
PY  - 2022
VL  - 217
IS  - NA
AB  - Groundwater abstraction is among the main anthropogenic causes of wetland desiccation worldwide, and corrective measures must be taken to avoid degradation of this valuable ecosystems. A case study is the Agua Amarga salt marsh (asymptotic to 180 ha) (SE Spain). Agua Amarga includes a solar saltwork pond network in operation between 1925 and 1975, when it was abandoned, and the ponds were colonized by salt marsh vegetation. In 2008 two desalination plants were operating in the marsh vicinity, which were supplied with groundwater. To mitigate the possible negative impact on the salt marsh ecosystem due to groundwater drawdown, in 2009 a sea water irrigation program was implemented. This paper summarizes the results of a ten-year monitoring program (2010-2020) to evaluate the effects of the irrigation program on groundwater levels and quality, soil salinity and moisture, and vegetation cover. During this period, average groundwater level was 2.5 m below the surface and around 1 m deep near the irrigated ponds. Groundwater salinity was not affected outside the saltmarsh, but inside, where the saltworks caused values to rise above 300 mS/cm, it decreased more than 150 mS/cm in some 20 m deep piezometers. Between 2012 and 2020, vegetation cover increased between asymptotic to 10 and asymptotic to 25 \%, with halophyte species such as Arthrocnemum macrostachyum and Sarcocornia fruticosa being the most favoured. In areas with prolonged flooding, Ruppia maritima, a plant species that lives submerged in saline water, was found. In the irrigated areas, soil electrical conductivity (1:5 soil:water extracts) decreased from asymptotic to 7-14 mS cm-1 to asymptotic to 2-6 mS cm-1. We present an example of sustainable actions in a coastal wetland, where the exploitation of water resources in semiarid areas is combined with promoting natural habitats.

JO  - Fujitsu Scientific And Technical Journal
PY  - 2017
VL  - 53
IS  - 6
AB  - Fuel cost and CO2 emissions in operating ships are major challenges for the maritime industry. A large marine transport company spends more than 2.6 billion U.S. dollars on fuel every year. In order to reduce fuel consumption as well as CO2 emissions from ships, it is crucial to be able to accurately calculate the impact of winds and waves on ship speed and fuel efficiency. Normally, existing ship performance estimation technologies rely on experiments with model ships in tanks of water, or on physics model simulations. However, they do not take into account the complicated interactions of winds, waves, and sea currents that influence the state of ships at real sea waters, resulting in large margins of error. Against this background, Fujitsu Laboratories has developed a technology to visualize ship performance. In addition to weather and sea conditions including winds, waves, and sea currents during actual ship operation, it collects engine log data and ship operation data such as location and ship speed, and posts it to the cloud, and then analyzes these data using high-dimensional statistical analysis that we developed. Applying this technology to a university-owned test ship and some merchant ships resulted in highly accurate estimation of ship speed and fuel consumption for each of the ships, with error of 5% or less. We also evaluated this technology through simulation and verified that it can improve fuel efficiency significantly. This paper describes this technology to predict ship performance in real sea waters, which is key to reducing ship fuel consumption, with some examples of system configurations.

AB  - Modern energy demands led the scientific community to renewable energy sources, such as ocean wave energy. The present work describes a model for a cost efficient rotary electrical generator, optimized for ocean wave energy conversion. The electrical power, supplied by low speed mechanical movement, requires the use of electrical machinery capable of generating high amounts of torque. Among the analyzed topologies, the one selected for further study was the Transverse Flux Permanent Magnet machine (TFPM). This topology differs from the conventional ones, presenting high power and torque densities, and allowing to independently set machine current and magnetic loadings in the machine. The machine was designed and analyzed through the use of a 3D FEM software. The obtained results show that the TFPM is a strong candidate to be used in large scale converting systems.

AB  - Ocean renewable energy provides tremendous worldwide potential in solving earth's acute energy shortage. Among the wide range of technologies that utilize ocean resources to generate power such as tidal current turbines, ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), offshore wind power converters etc., ocean wave energy converters (WEC) are distinct as they offer variety of ways to harness wave energy and also they provide higher energy density. The generator in power take off (PTO) of wave energy converter can be either direct drive rotary permanent magnet synchronous generator (DDR PMSG) or doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) which provides power with wide range of variations. This paper applies model predictive control (MPC) strategy in direct drive PMSG and DFIG in a point absorber wave energy converter. The simulation is done in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The effectiveness of the proposed control technique is verified. Â© 2016 IEEE.

VL  - 2019-March
IS  - NA
AB  - The X field is one of PETRONAS's Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) initiative plans involving separation of high CO2-Hydrocarbon gas and CO2 storage in offshore Malaysia. The X field is a high pressure high temperature (HPHT) carbonate reservoir with a temperature of 423 K and pressure of 36.0 MPa with about 500 m of gas column. It was chosen as a candidate due to its well and reservoir data completeness. The plan is technically challenging as it involves re-injecting produced supercritical CO2 back into an aquifer reservoir for permanent storage. Recently acquired X field DST data indicates the presence of CO2 in the aquifer, up to a level nearing saturation. Information of the initial CO2 concentration level in the aquifer reservoir is critical to ensure the success of the CO2 injection. Predictions on this initial CO2 solubility have been made using available well data, however the reliability of the results has to be validated by an experimental study. Therefore, an extensive experimental approach to measure initial CO2 solubility in the X field aquifer reservoir has been conducted. As pressure, temperature and salinity are the important key parameters that influence CO2 solubility, detailed information about X field gas and aquifer brine compositions are well determined prior to the solubility measurement. Utilizing lab facilities at Heriot-Watt University (HWU), measurements were conducted at T=423.15 K and pressure at 36.0 MPa to mimic the X field aquifer conditions. The experimental results obtained are compared against available literature data, Duan Model and sCPA-EoS model and reasonable agreements were observed. Experimental results indicated that the X field aquifer is not fully saturated with CO2 and it could accommodate an additional 6 mol% of CO2 dissolved in the brine. In addition, approximately 6 mol% of hydrocarbon will be recovered from the same aquifer system as a result of CO2 injection due to the CO2-Hydrocarbon displacement. This paper details lab measurements of initial CO2 solubility in the X field aquifer, including preparation, experimental procedure, results and discussion as well as suggested future works. Reservoir simulation incorporating the experimental data obtained from this study is necessary and recommended, for getting a full picture of the CO2 injection program for the current Carbon Capture Utilization &amp; Storage (CCUS) project.

AB  - The use of renewable energy to realize decarbonization is rapidly increasing, and considerable research is being performed to achieve highly efficient high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission for offshore wind power generation over long distances. However, in the case of onshore AC power transmission and distribution systems, with the mass introduction of distributed energy resources (DERs), voltage and frequency fluctuations often occur. It is thus necessary to implement the control function of smart inverters, which can facilitate the stabilization of the AC system, in the grid-connected inverters of DERs. Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is a smart inverter control strategy that can contribute to the stability of the AC system. In this study, conventional power control and VSG control were applied to the control strategy of modular multi-level converter-based poles of the HVDC transmission system, and the AC system fault tolerances of the entire system were examined.

AB  - This review paper examines the possible pathways and possible technologies available that will help the shipping sector achieve the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) deep decarbonization targets by 2050. There has been increased interest from important stakeholders regarding deep decarbonization, evidenced by market surveys conducted by Shell and Deloitte. However, deep decarbonization will require financial incentives and policies at an international and regional level given the maritime sector's similar to 3\% contribution to green house gas (GHG) emissions. The review paper, based on research articles and grey literature, discusses technoeconomic problems and/or benefits for technologies that will help the shipping sector achieve the IMO's targets. The review presents a discussion on the recent literature regarding alternative fuels (nuclear, hydrogen, ammonia, methanol), renewable energy sources (biofuels, wind, solar), the maturity of technologies (fuel cells, internal combustion engines) as well as technical and operational strategies to reduce fuel consumption for new and existing ships (slow steaming, cleaning and coating, waste heat recovery, hull and propeller design). The IMO's 2050 targets will be achieved via radical technology shift together with the aid of social pressure, financial incentives, regulatory and legislative reforms at the local, regional and international level.

JO  - Process Biochemistry
PY  - 2020
VL  - 90
IS  - NA
AB  - CO2 sequestration using microalgae has been deemed as a promising way, which can fix CO2 and simultaneously produce valuable bio-products. However, large scale open-pond production of Chlorella vulgaris is normally cultured using acetic acid as a carbon source, which is costly and shows a low efficiency in CO2 fixation. Here, a new mixotrophic culture strategy using both CO2 and acetic acid was developed and evaluated for CO2 sequestration by a C. vulgaris culture in an open pond. Our results show that the growth rate of C. vulgaris under this new mixotrophic condition reaches 0.24 g/L/d, which is higher than the 0.15 and 0.21 g/L/d of photoheterotrophic culture with acetic acids and photoautotrophic culture with CO2, respectively. The averaged CO2 fixation rate was determined as 0.29 g/L/d, which is much higher than heterotrophic method but slightly lower than photoautotrophic method. This result was further confirmed in a 125 m(2) open raceway pond. Physiological and biochemical characterization showed that the cell quality of C. vulgaris under mixotrophic conditions is better than those of photoautotrophic method and photoheterotrophic cultures. The enzyme activity assay and transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that the metabolism of carbohydrates and amino acids was significantly enhanced under mixotrophic condition compared with other groups, which may attribute to the increased biomass and CO2 sequestration of C. vulgaris. Our results suggest that this mixotrophic strategy can be applied in large-scale cultivation of C. vulgaris for biomass production and CO2 sequestration.

AB  - The ocean dominates the surface of our planet and plays a major role in regulating the biosphere. For example, the microscopic photosynthetic organisms living within provide 50% of the oxygen we breathe, and much of our food and mineral resources are extracted from the ocean. In a time of ecological crisis and major changes in our society, it is essential to turn our attention towards the sea to find additional solutions for a sustainable future. Remarkably, while we are overexploiting many marine resources, particularly the fisheries, the planktonic compartment composed of zooplankton, phytoplankton, bacteria and viruses, represents 95% of marine biomass and yet the extent of its diversity remains largely unknown and underexploited. Consequently, the potential of plankton as a bioresource for humanity is largely untapped. Due to their diverse evolutionary backgrounds, planktonic organisms offer immense opportunities: new resources for medicine, cosmetics and food, renewable energy, and long-term solutions to mitigate climate change. Research programs aiming to exploit culture collections of marine micro-organisms as well as to prospect the huge resources of marine planktonic biodiversity in the oceans are now underway, and several bioactive extracts and purified compounds have already been identified. This review will survey and assess the current state-of-the-art and will propose methodologies to better exploit the potential of marine plankton for drug discovery and for dermocosmetics.

AB  - The goal of reducing the climate impact of shipping requires many different activities. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the International Maritime Organization prepared some proposals to meet and fulfill the requirements. It sets out the provisions of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 73/78 Annex 6-Prevention of the Air Pollution from Ships (1997) with the amendments and the future objectives set. The main objective is to achieve climate neutrality from shipping by 2050. One method is the decarbonization of marine fuels. The types of fuels that are transient fuels, with the final target fuel being hydrogen, are shown. Carbon dioxide emissions depend on the chemical composition of the fuel, its Lower Heating Value and the engine efficiency. The aim of the manuscript is to demonstrate that the use of fuels with lower carbon content is a transitional process enabling the hydrogen era to take place. An analysis of this problem is presented as a review of the subject along with the author's comments and observations. The development of technologies for adapting potential fuels to combustion requirements in marine diesel engines and gas turbines, together with their storage and bunkering capabilities, are the main barriers to their limited use. The efficiency of marine diesel engines reaches a value of about 50\%, while that of fuel cells are close to 100\%. It seems that hydrogen will be the fuel of the future, including in shipping. Its basic use is in fuel cells, the efficiency of which is almost twice that of current thermal internal combustion engines.

AB  - During the past years, researchers have studied both numerically and experimentally multibody wave-wind combined energy structures supporting wind turbines and different types of Wave Energy Converters (WECs); rigid body hydrodynamic assumptions have been adopted so far for the development of their numerical models and the assessment of their produced power. In the present paper a numerical model that is based on the use of generalized modes addressing wave-structure interaction effects for the case of a multibody wave-wind combined structure is developed and presented. Afterwards, the developed numerical model is used for the assessment of the hydrodynamic response and the prediction of the produced power of different possible configurations of the updated WindWEC concept which consists of a spar supporting a wind turbine and one, two, three or four heaving type WEC buoys. The combined effects of the center-to-center distance of the WEC and spar platform, the number of the WECs and the grid configuration of spar and WECs on the hydrodynamic interaction between the different floating bodies, spar and WEC buoys, and consequently on their response and wave power production are examined for regular and irregular waves. Strong hydrodynamic interaction effects exist for small distance between spar and WECs that result to the decrease of the produced power. Power matrices of the updated WindWEC concept are presented for all examined configurations with different number of WECs. Moreover, the annual produced power of the updatedWindWEC in two sites is estimated and presented. The generalized modes analysis presented in this paper is generic and can be used for the early stage assessment of wave-wind combined energy structures with low computational cost. The updated WindWEC can be used in sea sites with different environmental characteristics while extracting valuable amount of wave power. Â© 2021 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

TI  - Large CO2 Storage Volumes Result in Net Negative Emissions for Greenhouse Gas Life Cycle Analysis Based on Records from 22 Years of CO2-Enhanced Oil Recovery Operations

AB  - Emissions were documented in a greenhouse gas emission life cycle analysis of 22 years of CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) operations for a site in the Northern Michigan Basin, U.S. At the site, CO2 was cycled through a series of 10 carbonate reef structures 1500-2000 m deep in the subsurface. The CO2 mobilized oil in the reefs, and the operator produced 294 Â»321 metric tons (2 Â»290 Â»000 barrels) of oil with CO2-EOR at the site from 1996 to 2017. In the process, a total of 2 Â»089 Â»000 metric tons of CO2 were stored in the deep rock formations, which is a very large volume for CO2-EOR applications of this scale. The life cycle analysis accounted for greenhouse gas emissions related to CO2 capture, compression, pipeline transport, CO2 injection, oil processing, CO2 recycle, dehydration, fugitive emissions, construction, land use, well drilling, oil transport, oil refining, hydrocarbon product combustion, and other processes. The analysis was based on site-specific operational records such as natural gas usage, drilling records, and system flow metering. Altogether, the upstream CO2 capture, "gate-to-gate"CO2-EOR operations, and downstream fuel product refining/combustion had total emissions of 1 Â»929 Â»443 metric tons of CO2 equivalent. Thus, the life cycle analysis showed -159 Â»907 metric tons of CO2 equivalent net balance for the CO2-EOR system for 1996-2017. The CO2-EOR system obtains CO2 from a gas processing facility that separates CO2 from natural gas produced in the area, and the CO2 would be otherwise vented to the atmosphere. A ready source of CO2 that allowed a large volume of associated CO2 storage, compressors that run on natural gas, a small pipeline distribution network, highly contained reservoirs, and government incentives to encourage CO2 storage also contributed to the lower CO2 emission balance when compared to other CO2-EOR life cycle studies. While this site had many favorable factors to result in net negative emissions, it provides an example of managing CO2-EOR operations and optimizing associated CO2 storage to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Burning of fossil fuels increases CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, resulting in a series of climate-and environment-related concerns such as global warming, sea-level rise, and melting of glaciers. Therefore, utilization of renewable energy to reduce the CO2 concentration, in order to realize a sustainable development, is urgent. Capturing and utilizing CO2, a greenhouse gas, can not only address these concerns but also alleviate the current scenario of energy shortage. Thermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation offers various pathways with high conversion efficiencies to produce fuels and industrial chemicals including CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, and CH4. However, CO2 is chemically inert due to the highly stable Cï¼O bond. Thus, harsh reaction conditions such as high temperature and pressure are required for CO2 hydrogenation. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction using renewable electricity and water is a promising alternative to thermocatalysis. This technology can not only store and transport the intermittent solar or wind energy but can also use water as the proton source instead of H2, which is indispensable for thermal CO2 hydrogenation. Electrochemical CO2 reduction under ambient conditions is a proton-coupled electron transfer process. The key to promote the electrochemical reduction of CO2 is to develop highly selective and active catalysts with high stability. Among various CO2 electrocatalysts, copper-based catalysts have attracted significant attention and have been extensively investigated, since they exhibit good selectivity and efficiency for the reduction of CO2 to hydrocarbons and alcohols. A broad range of products, up to 16 different gases and liquids, can be obtained in the CO2 electroconversion on copper. Copper is the only metal that has a negative adsorption energy for *CO and a positive adsorption energy for *H. Thus, it has a unique property of generating &gt; 2eâˆ’ transfer products. However, selectivity of the target product is still low, especially for high value-added C2+ species (C2H4, C2H5OH, CH3COOH, CH3CHO, n-C3H7OH, etc.). The selectivity of various products on copper-based catalysts could be enhanced by surface engineering techniques such as tuning the morphologies, particle sizes, surface facets, strains levels, and atomic coordination. Electrolyte engineering could also aid in CO2 electroreduction. Therefore, improving the selectivity of C2+ products by modifying copper-based catalysts could be a hot research topic. In addition, Câ€•C coupling is a key step in forming C2+ products, though the C2+ product formation pathway is complex, and the mechanisms are still unclear. Considering these, this paper mainly reviews the research progress in copper-based catalysts producing C2+ species in the last five years. It also discusses the possible reaction mechanisms and the factors that affect the product selectivities. In the end, further research directions are proposed.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has been working at a set of measures to regulate the carbon dioxide emissions in international shipping. A subject of the negotiations is the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). The index should force shipbuilders and naval architects to take emissions into consideration when designing new ships. The goal of MEPC 62 was to conclude the legal framework for the implementation of the EEDI. Based on research by the Dutch Center for Maritime Technology and Innovation (CMTI), the Netherlands submitted a proposal to exclude ships with a dead-weight below 20,000 tons from the EEDI indexation. Even if the Energy Efficiency Design Index is not a mandatory instrument at this time, shipbuilders and naval architects would be well advised to calculate the EEDI for their ship designs. Information about the voluntary verification of the EEDI can be found on the website of the IMO.

AB  - This paper presents an algorithm for mapping monopiles from Offshore Wind Farms (OWF). The ASV (Autonomous Surface Vehicle) surveys the environment, detects and localizes monopiles using situational awareness system based on LiDAR, GPS and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) data. The position of the monopile is obtained based on the relative localization between the extrapolated center of the structure that was detected and the ASV. A positive detection of a monopile is referenced to a global positioning frame based on the GPS. Results in a simulator environment demonstrate the ability of this situational awareness system to identify monopiles with a precision of 0.005 m, which is relevant for detecting structural disalignments over time that might be caused by the appearance of scour in the structure's foundation.

AB  - Fractional frequency transmission system (FFTS) is a relatively new transmission technology that can be used to deliver the energy from remote offshore wind farms, and it can increase the transmission capacity through the reduced transmission frequency. However, the dynamic performance of a FFTS with the wind farm may be different from that of a traditional ac transmission with the wind farm. In this paper, a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farm is connected to the main grid via the FFTS. The detailed dynamic model of the FFTS with wind farm is established first, and then the eigenvalue analysis is carried out to evaluate the system dynamic damping performance. To verify the results of eigenvalue analysis, dynamic simulations are carried out on a single machine infinite bus and a multimachine system. Both eigenvalue analysis and simulations demonstrate that the FFTS will have a negative influence on the damping of the DFIG-based wind farm in comparison to that of the wind farm with the traditional ac transmission system. However, with the control of cycloconverter, this problem can be easily overcome, and the damping performance of wind farm with FFTS can be even better.

JO  - Nature Energy

AB  - International maritime shipping-powered by heavy fuel oil-is a major contributor to global CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions. The direct electrification of maritime vessels has been underexplored as a low-emission option despite its considerable efficiency advantage over electrofuels. Past studies on ship electrification have relied on outdated assumptions on battery cost, energy density values and available on-board space. We show that at battery prices of US\$100 kWh(-1) the electrification of intraregional trade routes of less than 1,500 km is economical, with minimal impact to ship carrying capacity. Including the environmental costs increases the economical range to 5,000 km. If batteries achieve a US\$50 kWh(-1) price point, the economical range nearly doubles. We describe a pathway for the battery electrification of containerships within this decade that electrifies over 40\% of global containership traffic, reduces CO2 emissions by 14\% for US-based vessels, and mitigates the health impacts of air pollution on coastal communities. The maritime shipping industry is heavily energy-consuming and highly polluting, and, as such, is urgently seeking low-emission options. Here the authors examine the feasibility of battery-electric ships and show that the battery price declines could facilitate the electrification of short to medium-range shipping.

AB  - The transition to a sustainable economy is one of the major undertakings in human history. Meeting the International Maritime Organization's goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions from ships by 2050 is a critical step toward sustainability. It will require a comprehensive and proactive response from the maritime community. Shipping is well positioned to take concrete action by choosing to implement technologies that provide reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions. Technical solutions to improve energy efficiency and to decarbonize shipping are increasingly leading towards electrification in marine applications. Electric propulsion enables to optimize the power production under varying load profiles, and simplifies integration of energy storage systems and alternative power sources. In marine power distribution, DC grid solutions are gaining popularity and increasing the content of power electronics in shipboard power systems. Strict regulations and requirements to cut emissions are accelerating investments in renewable hydrogen and electrofuels. Accordingly, the marine industry is undergoing a rapid transition from fossil to alternative low-carbon fuels. This will introduce fuel cells as a credible alternative to internal combustion engines, and further increasing the share of electric power distribution semiconductorbased power conversion.

JO  - Decision Analysis
PY  - 2020
VL  - 17
IS  - 2
AB  - Many domains require the use of sophisticated simulators to adequately model the effect of chosen alternatives on the decision maker's value. Decision support in such complex systems brings unique challenges around efficiency, because simulating each combination of inputs can be time-consuming. In this paper, we conduct a value of information (VOI) analysis to study whether one should purchase information about critical input uncertainties in such complex systems. We propose a novel computational approach, where Gaussian processes are used to model the decision maker's profit as a function of different alternatives and uncertainties. Under this modeling assumption, the expected improvement of the profit is analytically available, which we use to approximate the VOI effectively over batches of simulations, thus avoiding too many computer-intensive evaluations of the system. We illustrate the proposed computational approach with an offshore wind farm maintenance application, where the decision maker relies on outputs from large-scale simulations to determine the optimal vessel fleet mix and number of personnel for operation and maintenance. Such computer-intensive simulations mimic long-term energy production under different input conditions. It is often not possible to explore all the alternatives exhaustively, and one must therefore guide the simulations to run on promising alternatives. We conduct a VOI analysis to study whether one should purchase information about failure rates of wind turbines for this application. The proposed methodologies are general and apply to other domains involving expensive simulators.

AB  - The shipping industry is becoming increasingly aware of its environmental responsibilities in the long-term. In 2018, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) pledged to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 50\% by the year 2050 as compared with a baseline value from 2008. Ammonia has been regarded as one of the potential carbon-free fuels for ships based on these environmental issues. In this paper, we propose four propulsion systems for a 2500 Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit (TEU) container feeder ship. All of the proposed systems are fueled by ammonia; however, different power systems are used: main engine, generators, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). Further, these systems are compared to the conventional main engine propulsion system that is fueled by heavy fuel oil, with a focus on the economic and environmental perspectives. By comparing the conventional and proposed systems, it is shown that ammonia can be a carbon-free fuel for ships. Moreover, among the proposed systems, the SOFC power system is the most eco-friendly alternative (up to 92.1\%), even though it requires a high lifecycle cost than the others. Although this study has some limitations and assumptions, the results indicate a meaningful approach toward solving GHG problems in the maritime industry.

PY  - 1993
VL  - 34

AB  - Physical-chemical processes for the capture and sequestration of CO2 from fossil fuel-fired power plant flue-gases are very expensive. Biological processes for CO2 utilization involve plant photosynthesis and conversion of the biomass to fuels, with no net CO2 production. Terrestrial plants cannot utilize flue gas CO2 directly. Only submerged aquatic plants, particularly microalgae, can utilize CO2 from power plant flue gases in a practical process. Microalgae have the potential for achieving high productivities and can be converted to gaseous and liquid fuels. A preliminary cost-analysis of such a process is presented that suggests that, if high productivities are achievable, overall costs would compare favorably with alternative physical-chemical processes for flue gas CO2 capture and sequestration, but would be higher than CO2 mitigation with terrestrial plants. Microalgae CO2 utilization systems would be most applicable where land and water (seawater, brackish) resources, not readily utilized by agriculture, are available. Â© 1993.

The model of a specially designed hybrid electric powertrain system has been introduced. The work uses the acquired operation and power load patterns of the BC Ferries Skeena Queen as a case study to demonstrate the fuel cost and emission reduction potentials of the electrified technology by comparing results from three powertrain alternatives: traditional diesel engine, diesel-electric, and series hybrid electric. The results showed that the electrification and hybridization could significantly reduce both fuel cost and harmful emissions. The series hybrid electric powertrain system has been targeted in this work due to its relatively small powertrain architecture difference from the traditional diesel-electric powertrain, and the ease of control development.

AB  - At present, Natuna is the largest gas field in the world, with the highest CO2 content. Of the total reserves (210 x 10(12) standard ft(3) (SCF)), more than 70\% are CO2. The Pertamina-National Oil and Gas Company, in co-operation with the Ministry of Research and Technology, will develop the Natuna project for 8 years, with plans to start in 1997. The facilities of the first train, with a production capacity of 0.4 x 10(9) SCF/d of saleable gas (methane), are planned to be completed by the year 2004. Since Natuna has a very high CO2 content, special treatment is required to protect the environment from the released CO2 The proposed processes are CO2 re-injection to the aquifer, and CO2 conversion to useful products such as methanol, methane and syngas. Using the current re-injection process would more than double the investment and operation costs without producing any significant additional byproducts. It would also have an impact on the production costs of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is the main export commodity of Indonesia for continuing development in all sectors. However, adopting a more reasonable, integrated CO2 conversion technology would provide some advantages, e.g. the higher investment costs would be compensated by additional byproducts such as methanol, syngas or methane, which would provide some LNG cost sharing as the main product of Natuna. On the basis of environmental considerations, a high temperature gas cooled reactor (HTGR) was proposed as the heat source for the Natuna project for CO2 conversion. To convert CO2 to useful products, a large amount of high quality water is required for the chemical processes, boilers and other purposes. One LNG production train (maximum of six trains) would produce 0.4 x 10(9) SCF/d of saleable gas and 1.4 x 109 SCF/d of CO2 (in the case of the Exxon process). This CO2 gas would then be converted to automobile fuel (methane, methanol), which requires a large amount of water. Natural gas from an off shore gas field is piped to the petrochemical complex on Natuna Island (about 228 km). Natuna is a small island that, apart from sea water, does not have much available water. The desalination process is considered to be the only solution to the water demand problems of the petrochemical complex. A nuclear desalination system was designed to provide high quality water for this complex. Of the commercial scale desalination processes, multi-stage flash, multi-effect distillation and reverse osmosis and hybrids are considered to be good candidates for the coupling scheme for producing high quality water. The availability of waste hear from the HTGR and an exothermic chemical reaction was also evaluated. It seems that an additional small to medium sized nuclear power plant may be required to produce water for the petrochemical complex of the Natuna project.

AB  - The introduction of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) caused an upsurge in activities for increasing the energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions of new vessel designs. However, application of the EEDI is not expected to further advance future design improvements partly owing to the fact the majority of the new buildings already comply with EEDI requirements and particularly since EEDI only considers a single operating point. In addition, the EEDI does not effectively assess a realistic improvement of measures for increasing the ship operating energy efficiency as they can be quite effective in the considered operating point for the EEDI but their performance greatly varies in the real operating conditions. In this study, a more realistic definition of the EEDI is proposed, which is based on a number of representative vessel operating points. The application of the proposed approach for the case of bulk carriers is investigated and the results are discussed in order to reveal its advantages against the currently used approach. The proposed approach can be employed by IMO for improving the energy efficiency regulatory framework. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

JO  - Applied Geochemistry
PY  - 2015
VL  - 63
IS  - NA
AB  - The delivery of organic carbon (C) from rivers to the coastal ocean via estuaries is recognized as an important component of the global C budget however, smaller river systems are often overlooked and modern flux estimates are not very different from historical estimates. Here, the seasonal (wet vs. dry) concentration and fluxes of dissolved organic C (DOC) were measured in five small sub-tropical rivers that drain into the Tampa Bay (FL, USA) estuary. DOC distributions were highly variable among riverine, mesohaline, and marine end-member samples in all river catchments and no significant differences were observed among or between DOC concentrations with respect to river catchment, season, or year of sampling. In general, DOC mixed non-conservatively during the wet seasons, and conservatively during the dry seasons, with the estuarine reaches of each river serving as a sink of DOC. Fluxes were strongly tied to discharge irrespective of season, and the estuaries removed 15-65\% of DOC prior to export to coastal Bay and Gulf of Mexico waters. DOC concentrations were similar to others reported for low-elevation sub-tropical rivers, and a combination of elevation, residence time, and climate appear to control the abundance and variability of DOC in sub-tropical vs. tropical river systems. The characterization of DOC in small, sub-tropical rivers, which share characteristics with both their temperate and tropical counterparts, is critical for quantitatively constraining the importance of these systems in local-to-regional scale ocean C budgets. In addition to geomorphic properties, the role of past, present, and future land cover and other environmental change in small coastal rivers also exerts control on the quantity and flux of DOC in these systems.

TI  - A two-step strategy for fuel consumption prediction and optimization of ocean-going ships
JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2022
VL  - 249
IS  - NA
AB  - The prediction and optimization of ship fuel consumption are the core techniques for the successful implementation of smart and green shipping. However, in previous studies, there were some drawbacks with poor prediction performance based on single models, as well as a few studies on data-driven trim optimization. To bridge these gaps, a two-step strategy for the prediction and optimization of ship fuel consumption was proposed in this study. In the first step, the collected fuel consumption data is processed, and a novel hybrid prediction model is then developed based on the stacking theory by fusing several state-of-the-art single models. Subsequently, the second step proposes a method based on the developed hybrid model in combination with the enumeration method to optimize the fuel consumption from the perspective of trim adjustment. To support the proposal, two real-world voyages from bulk carrier are taken as examples. Through experimentation, the proposed hybrid model has better accuracy and robustness than the other seven popular single models. Furthermore, trim optimization can effectively reduce the fuel consumption and carbon emissions by 0.69\%-1.82\%. This study provides fundamental theoretical, methodological, and technical support for fuel saving and emission reduction in ships.

AB  - Part funded by the EC and Swiss Government, Hercules (High-efficiency Engine R&D on Combustion with Ultra-low Emissions for Ships) is a joint project that would look at substantially reducing emissions from marine diesels. The HERCULEAN series of projects will end with HERCULES C, which began in January 2012 and aims to bring the project to a successful conclusion. Following the successful conclusion to HERCULES A and B, HERCULES C is now working towards three major objectives of achieving substantial reductions in fuel consumption, reducing emissions to "near zero" and maintaining the technical performance of an engine throughout its operational life. HERCULES C partners, led by the coordinator Nikolaos Kyrtatos, aim to achieve the first target through developments in fuel injection and combustion and through the ship energy. The project is due to conclude in 2015.

JO  - Ocean Engineering

AB  - In the last decade, there has been a growth of interest in tidal power as a renewable and clean source of energy. Southern part of Iran is a well placed in this regard, as the currents in this area are primarily tidal. Horizontal Axis Marine Current Turbine (HAMCT) is widely used as an extraction devise for tidal energy. In this paper, Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) and CFD have been conducted on this devise. Based on installation depth of HAMCT, turbine is subjected to gravity wave induced loads. A numerical study was conducted to design, analysis and predict hydrokinetic performance of HAMCT with and without extreme gravity waves. The fluid model has been created with appropriate dimensions. In order to model the high amplitude of wave ocean wave, linear wave theory for gravity waves is used. Numerical results of steady and transient solution have been compared to available experimental data. The simulation results demonstrate that by increasing the installation depth of HAMCT from the free surface, shaft loads and power coefficient of the turbine experience oscillate respectively. The simulation results demonstrate that compared with turbine only rotating in constant inflow, pressure and velocity contours experience oscillation respectively.The results of this study can provide data to choose appropriate installation depth for HAMCT to obtain higher power coefficient and avoid undesirable phenomena e.g. fatigue and cavitation.

AB  - Subsynchronous control interaction (SSCI) is a fast growing electrical interaction between series-compensated transmission lines and power electronic converters of DFIGs that may destroy the machines if not prevented. Thus, a nonlinear controller is proposed in order to mitigate SSCI in series-compensated doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms. Partial feedback linearization technique is utilized in developing the controller that involves a number of design steps. To evaluate the performance of the proposed controller, eigenvalue (modal) analysis and electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation are performed on a 100 MW DFIG-based offshore wind farm connected to the grid through series-compensated lines. Eigenvalue study reveals the presence of several unstable subsynchronous modes with the PI controller while the system mostly retains stability with the use of the designed Partial feedback linearizing (PFL) controller unless the compensation level is too high (above 90%). EMT simulation, on the other hand, shows that the prevalent SSCI in the system with the PI controller is effectively damped through the use of the designed PFL controller in less than 2.3 s.

TI  - Technical & economic feasibility study for commercial ships with HFO, LNG, and NH3 as fuel
JO  - Aiche Annual Meeting, Conference Proceedings

VL  - 2019-November
IS  - NA
AB  - Objective/Scope: International Maritime Organization (IMO) announced the initial strategy for GHG (Green-House Gas) emission of ships according to â€œParis Climate Agreementâ€. In order to resolve the GHG emission issue from ships, a demand for GHG solution technologies is increasing such as alternative fuels and energies. Recently, well-known companies and research centers presented positive results on NH3 for ship GHG reduction. And MAN Energy Solutions presented development plans on ammonia engines for ship CO2 emission reduction. DSME (Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering) also thinks that ammonia will be one of options as ship fuel for CO2 reduction. Therefore, DSME has conducted various researches on ammonia related ship fuel. In this presentation, we would like to introduce the main results of the feasibility study for "Technical and Economic Feasibiity Study for Commercial Ships with HFO, LNG, and NH3 as Fuelâ€. Our goal for that study is to identify the competitiveness of ammonia compared with HFO (w/scrubber) and LNG through technical and economic analysis of NH3. Methods, Procedures, Process: In view of the ship builder company, the technical and economic feasibility study for ammonia as engine fuel of commercial ships was studied and analyzed. The study was compared and analyzed to figure out which fuel among HFO (w/scrubber), LNG, and NH3 is the best option for GHG reduction of commercial ships. We also have researched which fuels will be more competitive depending on ship type, fuel price, route distance, storage method, tank material and so on. Based on lifetime for ships, we calculated and estimated the total CAPEX and OPEX according to fuel type and related systems. The technical problems and alternatives in NH3 engineering and system for commercial ships have been studied. Results, Observations, Conclusions: DSME has completed the feasibility study to acquire the preliminary technical and economic analysis of NH3 as fuel compared with HFO and LNG. The results of this study suggest that NH3 can be economic fuel for ships when ammonia has the competitive price to decrease considerable cost of production and raw materials. If IMO applies more strong emission regulations on ships in the near future, the competitiveness of NH3 as a ship fuel can be increased dramatically. Finally, if infrastructure for ammonia fuel would be well equipped in the major international ports, the era for NH3 as ship fuels will be realized faster than expected. For preparing the NH3 era, DSME is planning to expand our technology and business to NH3 engineering and systems for commercial ships based on top-tier cryogenic technologies and a lot of track records, especially in LNG and LPG systems for ships. Future Plans / Additive Information: DSME is discussing to participate in NH3 projects related ship fuels such as "Ammonia Fuel" projects. For stable and efficient operation of NH3 as a ship fuel, we can develop NH3 engineering and systems such as â€œNH3 supply systemâ€ and â€œNH3 liquefaction systemâ€. DSME hopes to set up a cooperation network with competitive companies for the next stage of several NH3 engineering packages for ships. The cooperation network will research and develop NH3 engineering packages for ships in more details and the result will bring commercial realization of this innovative approach to NH3 as a ship fuel.

AB  - Application feasibility of the accelerated deasphaltening process for simultaneous removal of asphaltenes and water from a water-in-bitumen emulsion has been examined with a pilot plant having capacity of 1.590Â m3/day. The solvent (n-pentane) was injected into the emulsion from three locations with progressively increasing temperature from 423Â K. The first solvent injection precipitated the asphaltenes in bitumen, the second broke the emulsion and facilitated the phase separation, and the third extracted the oil that remained in heavy asphaltenes/water phase. The effects of operation parameters such as temperature, solvent/bitumen ratio, feed rate and feedstock composition on the quality of DAO (Deasphaltening oil) were investigated. The DAO with the yield of ~ 80Â wt.% and asphaltene content of < 0.5Â wt.% was produced under optimal operating conditions, and the residual product was a porous solids containing 38% sulfur, 47% nitrogen, 64% MCR, and 85% metals (nickel and vanadium) of the bitumen. For a real application in oil industry, other important aspects including energy efficiency, solvent recovery and water purification have been discussed. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper assesses profit, cost and emissions for slender bulk vessel designs. Traditionally bulk vessels have been designed to maximize cargo carrying ability at the lowest building cost and not on reducing energy consumption. The outcome has been shoebox shaped vessels with short bow sections and hence rather poor hydrodynamic performance even at calm sea and even worse in rough sea. High fuel costs and the mandatory energy efficiency design index, as well as increased environmental concerns have challenged this practice. The present paper provides an assessment of alternative bulk vessel with focus on hull slenderness, expressed by the length block coefficient for alternative fuel price and freight rate scenarios. Our results indicate that slender designs reduce emissions and increases the profit compared to the traditional full bodied designs. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

JO  - Marine Technology Society Journal
PY  - 2013
VL  - 47
IS  - 1
AB  - The University of New Hampshire is studying CO2 gas exchange, ocean acidification, air-sea dynamics, and associated biological processes in the western Gulf of Maine. Two buoys provide data supporting these studies. The UNH CO2 buoy has been deployed jointly with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory northeast of the Isles of Shoals since 2006. The Jeffreys Ledge Moored Observatory is a development mooring testing new techniques and is deployed east of Gloucester, MA. This mooring is testing the direct covariance measurement of wind stress using a 3-D sonic anemometer with a motion package to remove buoy motion effects. A fast-rate atmospheric CO2 sensor is mounted by the anemometer to evaluate its potential for direct covariance gas flux measurements. Both buoys have additional meteorological and oceanographic sensors to provide supporting measurements. Six years of CO2 buoy data have helped quantify the seasonal air-sea flux cycle of CO2 in the Western Gulf of Maine. The buoy is now a node in near-term ocean carbon cycle process control experiments and longer-term ocean acidification monitoring. The Jeffreys Ledge buoy momentum flux measurements using wind and motion measurements indicate reasonable first-order buoy motion corrections can be made. Also, buoy-induced flow disturbance requires postmeasurement corrections. Rapid buoy azimuthal rotations were corrected with the addition of a steering vane. A vertical array of oxygen sensors captures phytoplankton bloom signatures and provides net community production estimates that augment in-water SAMI-CO2 measurements and add to a robust system to support process studies and improved biophysical modeling within this region.

TI  - Glacial CO2 decrease and deep-water deoxygenation by iron fertilization from glaciogenic dust
JO  - Climate Of The Past
PY  - 2019
VL  - 15
IS  - 3
AB  - Increased accumulation of respired carbon in the deep ocean associated with enhanced efficiency of the biological carbon pump is thought to be a key mechanism of glacial CO2 drawdown. Despite greater oxygen solubility due to seawater cooling, recent quantitative and qualitative proxy data show glacial deep-water deoxygenation, reflecting increased respired carbon accumulation. However, the mechanisms of deep-water deoxygenation and contribution from the biological pump to glacial CO2 drawdown have remained unclear. In this study, we report the significance of iron fertilization from glaciogenic dust in glacial CO2 decrease and deep-water deoxygenation using our numerical simulation, which successfully reproduces the magnitude and large-scale pattern of the observed oxygen changes from the present to the Last Glacial Maximum. Sensitivity experiments show that physical changes contribute to only one-half of all glacial deep deoxygenation, whereas the other one-half is driven by iron fertilization and an increase in the whole ocean nutrient inventory. We find that iron input from glaciogenic dust with higher iron solubility is the most significant factor in enhancing the biological pump and deep-water deoxygenation. Glacial deep-water deoxygenation expands the hypoxic waters in the deep Pacific and Indian oceans. The simulated global volume of hypoxic waters is nearly double the present value, suggesting that glacial deep water was a more severe environment for benthic animals than that of the modern oceans. Our model underestimates the deoxygenation in the deep Southern Ocean because of enhanced ventilation. The model-proxy comparison of oxygen change suggests that a stratified Southern Ocean is required for reproducing the oxygen decrease in the deep Southern Ocean. Iron fertilization and a global nutrient increase contribute to a decrease in glacial CO2 of more than 30 ppm, which is supported by the model-proxy agreement of oxygen change. Our findings confirm the significance of the biological pump in glacial CO2 drawdown and deoxygenation.
