AB  - Mighty Whale is a floating wave power device based on the Oscillating Water Column (OWC) principle. It converts wave energy into electric energy, and produces a relatively calm sea area behind. The open sea tests were begun in September 1998 in Gokasho Bay, Nansei Town, Mie Prefecture. Measurements collected since then include performance data in typhoon seasons. This paper presents the measurements of wave energy absorption, floating body motion, and wave height dissipation. It is expected that these results will be useful in the design of offshore wave power devices in the future.

TI  - Managed Retreat of Saline Coastal Wetlands: Challenges and Opportunities Identified from the Hunter River Estuary, Australia
JO  - Estuaries And Coasts
PY  - 2014
VL  - 37
IS  - 1
AB  - We analyse the potential impacts of sea-level rise on the management of saline coastal wetlands in the Hunter River estuary, NSW, Australia. We model two management options: leaving all floodgates open, facilitating retreat of mangrove and saltmarsh into low-lying coastal lands; and leaving floodgates closed. For both management options we modelled the potential extent of saline coastal wetland to 2100 under a low sea-level rise scenario (based on 5 % minima of SRES B1 emissions scenario) and a high sea-level rise scenario (based on 95 % maxima of SRES A1FI emissions scenario). In both instances we quantified the carbon burial benefits associated with those actions. Using a dynamic elevation model, which factored in the accretion and vertical elevation responses of mangrove and saltmarsh to rising sea levels, we projected the distribution of saline coastal wetlands, and estimated the volume of sediment and carbon burial across the estuary under each scenario. We found that the management of floodgates is the primary determinant of potential saline coastal wetland extent to 2100, with only 33 % of the potential wetland area remaining under the high sea-level rise scenario, with floodgates closed, and with a 127 % expansion of potential wetland extent with floodgates open and levees breached. Carbon burial was an additional benefit of accommodating landward retreat of wetlands, with an additional 280,000 tonnes of carbon buried under the high sea-level rise scenario with floodgates open (775,075 tonnes with floodgates open and 490,280 tonnes with floodgates closed). Nearly all of the Hunter Wetlands National Park, a Ramsar wetland, will be lost under the high sea-level rise scenario, while there is potential for expansion of the wetland area by 35 % under the low sea-level rise scenario, regardless of floodgate management. We recommend that National Parks, Reserves, Ramsar sites and other static conservation mechanisms employed to protect significant coastal wetlands must begin to employ dynamic buffers to accommodate sea-level rise change impacts, which will likely require land purchase or other agreements with private landholders. The costs of facilitating adaptation may be offset by carbon sequestration gains. Â© 2013 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.

AB  - Mangroves can play a crucial part in climate change mitigation policies due to their high carbon-storing capacity. However, the carbon sequestration potential of Indian mangroves generally remained unexplored to date. In this study, multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and 2 data-derived variables were used to estimate the AGB of a tropical carbon-rich mangrove forest of India. Ensemble prediction of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Model (GBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were used for AGB prediction. The multi-temporal dataset was used in two different ways to find the most suitable method of using them. The results of the analysis showed that the modeling field measured AGB with individual date data values results in estimates with root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 149.242 t/ha for XGB to 151.149 t/ha for the RF. Modeling AGB with the average and percentile metrics of the multi-temporal image stack improves the prediction accuracy of AGB, with RMSE ranging from 81.882 t/ha for the XGB to 74.493 t/ha for the RF. The AGB modeling using ensemble prediction showed further improvement in accuracy with an RMSE of 72.864 t/ha and normalized RMSE of 11.38%. In this study, the intra-seasonal variation of Sentinel-1 and 2 data for mangrove ecosystems was explored for the first time. The variations in remotely sensed variables could be attributed mainly to soil moisture availability and rainfall in the mangrove ecosystem. The efficiency of Sentinel-1 and 2 data-derived variables and ensemble prediction of machine learning models for Indian mangroves were also explored for the first time. The methodologies established in this study can be used in the future for accurate prediction and repeated monitoring of AGB for mangrove ecosystems. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present study aims to find the best location for installing wave energy converters (WEC) in the NEOM area, located in the Red Sea northern region, and to determine the most suitable converter system for harvesting wave energy using available data provided by KAUST. The Red Sea region represents a challenge for wave modulization and analysis due to its two distinct and opposing wave structures induced by reverse winds that converge at its middle. By incorporating wind and wave data series from 1985 to 2015 in the Advanced Research Weather and Forecasting model and WAVEWATCH III. In the present study, the highest peak period found in the selected area is 4 seconds based on the wave hindcast generated on a 1-km resolution grid, and the highest wave found was 0.79 m. A total of 8 points were selected and analyzed to test the potential of wave energy at NEOM coastlines along the Gulf of Aqaba and NEOM Bay. Based on the results, the Gulf of Aqaba, with a mean wave power of 1.98 kW/m at P\#2 is a good candidate for a WEC system. Possible installation of wave energy converters in the selected areas is discussed in this thesis, including farms of point absorbers with the integration of wave and solar sources (DEIM). Based on preliminary information regarding the NEOM region, potential environmental and social challenges were identified in this study for the viability of wave energy exploitation.

JO  - Science Of The Total Environment
PY  - 2022
VL  - 848
IS  - NA
AB  - Coastal wetlands provide key ecosystem services, including substantial long-term storage of atmospheric CO2 in soil organic carbon pools. This accumulation of soil organic matter is a vital component of elevation gain in coastal wetlands responding to sea-level rise. Anthropogenic activities that alter coastal wetland function through disruption of tidal exchange and wetland water levels are ubiquitous. This study assesses soil vertical accretion and organic carbon accretion across five coastal wetlands that experienced over a century of impounded hydrology, followed by restoration of tidal exchange 5 to 14 years prior to sampling. Nearby marshes that never experienced tidal impoundment served as controls with natural hydrology to assess the impact of impoundment and restoration. Dated soil cores indicate that elevation gain and carbon storage were suppressed 30â€“70 % during impoundment, accounting for the majority of elevation deficit between impacted and natural sites. Only one site had substantial subsidence, likely due to oxidation of soil organic matter. Vertical and carbon accretion gains were achieved at all restored sites, with carbon burial increasing from 96 Â± 33 to 197 Â± 64 g C mâˆ’2 yâˆ’1. The site with subsidence was able to accrete at double the rate (13 Â± 5.6 mm yâˆ’1) of the natural complement, due predominantly to organic matter accumulation rather than mineral deposition, indicating these ecosystems are capable of large dynamic responses to restoration when conditions are optimized for vegetation growth. Hydrologic restoration enhanced elevation resilience and climate benefits of these coastal wetlands. Â© 2022

JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2014
VL  - 82
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper presents a study of the factors that influence array layout on wave energy farms. The WEC considered is a two-body heave converter extracted from Babarit et al. (2012). Simulations were run through a time domain model from de Andres et al. (2013) with irregular waves considering different sea states. Factors analyzed in this paper are array layout, WEC separation, number of WECs and wave directionality. Results show that wave directionality is very important in order to achieve constructive interference. When looking at the number of WECs the conclusion is that as the larger the number of WECs, more interactions are possible and therefore, the higher the interaction factor is. Regarding array layout, triangle and square configurations were found to be similar and the efficiency of each one depends on the most probable peak period. Separating distance was found to be a key factor and L10/2 was set as the optimal one. Finally, wave climate was classified in different subtypes around the globe. The optimum layout in these sites was assessed. The influence of directionality was studied and the triangular configuration was found to be the most favorable for multidirectional climates while square configurations were most adequate in unidirectional climates.

JO  - Journal Of Ocean Engineering And Marine Energy
PY  - 2020
VL  - 6
IS  - 1
AB  - Wind energy industry is expanded to offshore and deep water sites, primarily due to the stronger and more consistent wind fields. Floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) concepts involve new engineering and scientific challenges. A combination of waves, current, and wind loads impact the structures. Often under extreme cases, and sometimes in operational conditions, magnitudes of these loads are comparable with each other. The loads and responses may be large, and simultaneous consideration of the combined environmental loads on the response of the structure is essential. Moreover, FOWTs are often large structures and the load frequencies are comparable to the structural frequencies. This requires a fluidâ€“structureâ€“fluid elastic analysis which adds to the complexity of the problem. Here, we present a critical review of the existing approaches that are used to (i) estimate the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads on FOWTs, and (ii) to determine the structuresâ€™ motion and elastic responses due to the combined loads. Particular attention is given to the coupling of the loads and responses, assumptions made under each of the existing solution approaches, their limitations, and restrictions, where possible, suggestions are provided on areas where further studies are required.

AB  - Wind energy is abundantly available in nature both on onshore and offshore. As a response to the climatic crisis the focus on wind energy is increasing due to its renewable and environment friendly energy production. Due to social and political reasons the trend has been shifted largely from onshore to offshore wind farms. Offshore wind energy production faces a wide range of new challenges in design, development, manufacturing, installing, and maintenance and operational. In this paper the challenges and issues pertaining to reliability and safety data collection of offshore wind turbines are outlined. In the offshore oil and gas industry the OREDA concept for data collection has been running for more than 25 years. We therefore briefly describe what is considered to be the state of the art within this industry when it comes to data collection. Next we discuss expected differences between the oil and gas industry, and the wind power industry which will have an impact on data collection. Finally we point at some trends that we believe will be important for future data collection especially related to availability to online condition monitoring data. The reliability and safety data will be of utmost importance when maintenance and inspection strategies are to be developed. Therefore we also give some preliminary aspects related to what type of data we really need for various types of analyses. Â© 2010 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Liquefied natural gas (LNG) has emerged as an alternative clean fuel source that is helping the global shipping industry in reducing emission levels and maintaining efficiency. Several shipping companies have configured on-board bunker tanks and systems, approving them to be used for LNG. High oil and energy prices around the world are also influencing shipping companies, to use LNG. LNG is providing power for the existing carriers, a few ferries, and a number of offshore vessels in Norway. Several ferries and a coastguard cutter from Norwegian shipping service are also being powered by LNG. A large of ships are being powered by LNG in the country, as it has sufficient LNG, to deliver as bunkers, while willing to reduce both air pollution and marine pollution risk. It is expected that many more local ferries and vessels will be operating on LNG around the world in future.

TI  - A trip-ahead strategy for optimal energy dispatch in ship power systems

PY  - 2021
VL  - 192
IS  - NA
AB  - Optimizing ship power systems with diesel generators such as the platform supply vessel (PSV) has become a pressing issue due to the emission of carbon dioxide. This paper investigates the optimal operation of diesel generators in marine power systems, particularly the PSV. The investigation is mainly focused on carbon dioxide emission and fuel consumption in a ship's mission. In this regard, this paper presents a clear optimization strategy, called a trip-ahead to determine the best operation schedule of generators to supply the electricity demand for the next days of a PSV. The PSV has six generators (i.e., four primary and two auxiliary diesel generators) with two different fuel consumption curves and carbon dioxide emission. The trip-ahead algorithm's objective functions consist of minimization of cost and emission during the complete PSV mission. A power level is assigned to each generator for each hour of the next day of a 5-day trip, taking into account the fuel consumption per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The prepared sample of the load profile is the historical demand records of a real PSV. Additionally, this paper compares the results of the proposed approach with other optimization algorithms such as the Genetic algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO), and the software HOMER Pro optimization tool. Moreover, this paper presents the sensitivity analysis to compensate for possible errors in prediction demand for the next trip. The results prove the proposed algorithm in comparing GA and PSO is more accurate and the calculation velocity of the proposed algorithm when objective functions are cost and emission is about 27% and 46% better than the PSO and about 36% and 62% better than the GA, respectively.

AB  - Profuse formation of hydrate shells on gas bubbles and nucleation of at least seven different morphologies or species of gas hydrate have been achieved in natural seawater. By using newly collected natural seawater, which is a chemically and biologically complex fluid, our experiments in pressurized, refrigerated vessels closely track the growth mechanisms of gas hydrate in oceanic seafloors. Nearly complete pore fill by hydrate can best be accomplished by nucleation of hydrate at point sources within the pore water or on sediment particulate, with growth outward into water space that is refreshed with circulating pore water having high concentrations of hydrate forming gas. Recovery of natural gas from hydrate deposits will depend on ensuring a large enough surface area of hydrate exposed to the circulating pore water. Fracking may be required.

TI  - Assessment of CO2 Injectivity During Sequestration in Depleted Gas Reservoirs
JO  - Geosciences
PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - 5
AB  - Depleted gas reservoirs are appealing targets for carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration because of their storage capacity, proven seal, reservoir characterization knowledge, existing infrastructure, and potential for enhanced gas recovery. Low abandonment pressure in the reservoir provides additional voidage-replacement potential for CO2 and allows for a low surface pump pressure during the early period of injection. However, the injection process poses several challenges. This work aims to raise awareness of key operational challenges related to CO2 injection in low-pressure reservoirs and to provide a new approach to assessing the phase behavior of CO2 within the wellbore. When the reservoir pressure is below the CO2 bubble-point pressure, and CO2 is injected in its liquid or supercritical state, CO2 will vaporize and expand within the well-tubing or in the near-wellbore region of the reservoir. This phenomenon is associated with several flow assurance problems. For instance, when CO2 transitions from the dense-state to the gas-state, CO2 density drops sharply, affecting the wellhead pressure control and the pressure response at the well bottom-hole. As CO2 expands with a lower phase viscosity, the flow velocity increases abruptly, possibly causing erosion and cavitation in the flowlines. Furthermore, CO2 expansion is associated with the Joule-Thomson (IJ) effect, which may result in dry ice or hydrate formation and therefore may reduce CO2 injectivity. Understanding the transient multiphase phase flow behavior of CO2 within the wellbore is crucial for appropriate well design and operational risk assessment. The commonly used approach analyzes the flow in the wellbore without taking into consideration the transient pressure response of the reservoir, which predicts an unrealistic pressure gap at the wellhead. This pressure gap is related to the phase transition of CO2 from its dense state to the gas state. In this work, a new coupled approach is introduced to address the phase behavior of CO2 within the wellbore under different operational conditions. The proposed approach integrates the flow within both the wellbore and the reservoir at the transient state and therefore resolves the pressure gap issue. Finally, the energy costs associated with a mitigation process that involves CO2 heating at the wellhead are assessed.

AB  - Electric propulsion has been used extensively in the cruise and LNG market. ABB is looking to extend its usage, with the container ship sector as the best place to realize fuel and cost savings. ABB believes that the growth in the use of electrical propulsion in e maritime sector is set to grow substantially up to 2020, as it becomes the propulsion of choice for a number of shipping sectors. The new improved versions of company's Azipod XO range extend the periods between dry docking. Much of the maintenance of the new XO Azipods can be carried out from inside the pod itself including maintenance of shaft seals and thrust bearings. Moreover, the hydrodynamic efficiency of the pod has produced 2-3% fuel efficiencies. ABB also hopes to develop its DC Grid system that converts AC power to DC and distributes electricity where it is needed throughout the vessel. In addition, supplementary power sources, e.g., solar panels, fuel cells, batteries, or super capacitors, can be plugged directly into the DC Grid system to allow ship operators to make further fuel efficiencies.

Even though extensive technology development and demonstrations have occurred in the areas of ocean thermal energy, wave energy and tidal energy over the last 40 years, commercial plants based on these technologies are very slow in coming up because of the high capital costs. In recent years, due to increase in the fossil fuel costs, renewable energies such as solar photo voltaic systems and wind energy systems have become cost competitive. Ocean energy systems are likely to become cost competitive in a decade or so, especially for remote islands and coastal areas.

TI  - Natural gas pressurized liquefaction process adopting cascade refrigeration and CO2 removal by anti-sublimation
JO  - 6th Asian Conference On Refrigeration And Air Conditioning, Acra 2012
PY  - 2012
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - To reduce the area of offshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, a novel natural gas pressurized liquefaction process combined with CO2 removal is put forward in this paper. Taking off CO2 pretreatment facility, the process uses a crystallizer to remove CO2 from natural gas by anti-sublimation during liquefaction process. The process adopts a cascade refrigeration cycle to obtain cooling energy and produce pressurized liquefied natural gas (PLNG), with dry ice as by-product. Because of higher liquefaction temperature in PLNG process, the three-stage cascade refrigeration cycle commonly used in conventional process is replaced by a CH 4/C2H4 two-stage cycle in the proposed process. The natural gas with high CO2 content is firstly cooled at the pressure of about 1.5MPa, until the CO2 fraction is lowered to 0.5%. In this way, most of the CO2 in the feed gas is separated by anti-sublimation. To avoid further freeze-out in the following process, the remaining natural gas is compressed to a higher pressure, and then cooled down until it is liquefied. The performance of the process is simulated with HYSYS software. Taking unit product power consumption as the major index for analysis, the optimum parameters of the process are worked out in this paper. Besides, the effects of CO2 content on power consumption are also investigated, and the results indicate that higher CO2 content in feed gas leads to higher unit product power consumption. Moreover, the optimal values of unit product power consumption show that the novel process can liquefy natural gas at an acceptable energy cost, usually under 0.35 kWh/Nm 3. Therefore, the novel process is a good option for offshore natural gas liquefaction.

TI  - What Feeds the Benthos in the Arctic Basins? Assembling a Carbon Budget for the Deep Arctic Ocean
JO  - Frontiers In Marine Science
PY  - 2020
VL  - 7
IS  - NA
AB  - Half of the Arctic Ocean is deep sea (>1000 m), and this area is currently transitioning from being permanently ice-covered to being seasonally ice-free. Despite these drastic changes, it remains unclear how organisms are distributed in the deep Arctic basins, and particularly what feeds them. Here, we summarize data on auto- and heterotrophic organisms in the benthic, pelagic, and sympagic realm of the Arctic Ocean basins from the past three decades and put together an organic carbon budget for this region. Based on the budget, we investigate whether our current understanding of primary and secondary production and vertical carbon flux are balanced by the current estimates of the carbon demand by deep-sea benthos. At first glance, our budget identifies a mismatch between the carbon supply by primary production (3-46 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), the carbon demand of organisms living in the pelagic (7-17 g C m(-2)) and the benthic realm (< 5 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) versus the low vertical carbon export (at 200 m: 0.1-1.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1), at 3000-4000 m: 0.01-0.73 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). To close the budget, we suggest that episodic events of large, fast sinking ice algae aggregates, export of dead zooplankton, as well as large food falls need to be quantified and included. This work emphasizes the clear need for a better understanding of the quantity, phenology, and the regionality of carbon supply and demand in the deep Arctic basins, which will allow us to evaluate how the ecosystem may change in the future.

TI  - Aboveground carbon stock in a restored neotropical mangrove: influence of management and brachyuran crab assemblage
JO  - Wetlands Ecology And Management
PY  - 2019
VL  - 27
IS  - 2-3
AB  - Mangrove forests are important sinks of atmospheric carbon, and the internal deposits and fluxes of organic matter can reflect how these ecosystems respond to disturbances and environmental changes. Data on carbon content of mangrove forests vary geographically due to differences in abiotic (climate, geomorphic settings, tides) and biotic (diversity, herbivory, bioturbation) conditions. Mangroves have been degraded worldwide and ecological restoration is an alternative to recover these ecosystems and their functionality. However, although growing and biomass after disturbances have been addressed, studies on the recovery of faunal groups are rare. The brachyuran crab assemblage is strongly integrated to carbon recycling and ecosystem functioning, since propagule consumption and fossorial activity can affect the diversity and biomass of mangroves. We assessed the aboveground biomass and carbon stock of differently managed mangrove areas in northeastern Brazil, after being deforested for shrimp culture and then abandoned, and compared data with other forests worldwide. After a decade, the area restored with Rhizophora mangle showed higher carbon stock than the self-recovered forest and similar amount as an older forest. We discuss the applied rehabilitation measures regarding the effects of management and brachyuran crabs on forest aboveground carbon storage. The effects of herbivory and bioturbation of brachyurans on the low recruitment of Laguncularia racemosa propagules, contributed to higher biomass levels in the restored forest through reinforcing the predominance of R. mangle, which stocks more aboveground carbon with respect to Laguncularia. This suggests that the particularities of target tree species and brachyuran assemblage need to be considered in mangrove restoration, since they are related to function recovering and carbon cycling in the ecosystem.

VL  - 4(1)
IS  - 1
AB  - Passive aeration has been demonstrated to be a viable and cost-effective alternative to traditional active bioventing at remote locations where conditions are favorable. Barometric pressure oscillations create the driving force for passive aeration, providing the vadose zone is sufficiently permeable. This technology utilizes a unidirectional valve that responds to barometric pressure changes. When atmospheric pressure is greater than internal vent well pressure, the valve opens allowing an ingress of ambient air. Subsequently, oxygenation of contaminated vadose zone soils occurs, stimulating bioremediation. Conversely, when atmospheric pressure drops below the internal vent well pressure, the valve closes preventing oxygenated soil gas from exhausting. Studies performed at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC) in Twentynine Palms, California have shown increases in O-2 concentrations from approximately 2.0 to 15.0\% following passive aeration. Resultant biodegradation rates ranged from 0.3 to 2.1 mg/kg/day. Sufficient aeration at many monitoring locations, however, appears to be limited by the radius of influence of venting wells. One disadvantage observed with passive aeration is the inability to achieve adequate airflow rates and volumes of air necessary to successfully aerate large plumes. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate techniques for optimizing a passive bioventing system. Evaluation of a tandem arrangement of passive valves with different configurations for air injection and soil-gas withdrawal to increase the zone of influence also is being conducted.

AB  - Machine maintenance and repair is not a trivial issue when it comes to renewable energy devices. It has been said that one of the most important factors in enhancing the marketability of wind energy is to cut its overall maintenance costs, which is about 10% - 20% of the overall cost of energy [1]. The average maintenance and repair costs of ocean wave energy devices are yet to be determined, but it may be higher than wind energy. The harsh ocean environment, repeated cycling of the drive train, coastal storms, environmental concerns, loss of revenue due to long periods of machine downtime, safety issues concerning technicians working on the buoy while it's still in operation, and so forth, all add to the maintenance and repair costs of a WEC (Wave Energy Converter). This study proposes a unique damage accumulation prediction algorithm that enables real-time determination of bearing fatigue life. Â© 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Development of a huge wind-sailing solar cell raft (SCR) with dimensions of 5Ã—5 km is proposed, which can generate electricity comparable to a 1,000-MW nuclear power plant in low-latitude Pacific Ocean. Solar energy of 8 kÂ·Wh/m2/day or more is targeted because the SCR navigates in fine weather using weather satellites. The generated electricity will be transported by battery tankers loaded with a tremendous number of high-energy-density batteries. Studies based on available data indicate that there are vast open seas in the tropical Pacific Ocean, where the maximum solar energy attains 7 kÂ·Wh/m2/day annually on average and conditions of winds, waves, and sea currents are favorable for the solar energy system to operate. Three major technologies for breakthrough to realize this system are discussed from their future perspectives. Â© 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - This work reports a novel solution-based method to trigger the growth of diatoms for enhanced biomass production, which can efficiently stimulate their applications in nutraceuticals, aquaculture and wastewater remediation. The optimization for the growth of three marine diatoms species was performed using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) synthesized nanosilica which can be a cost-effective and productive method for biomass production. The exponential growth phase was achieved in 14 days with high biomass productivity compared to F/2-Si Media [Chaetoceros sp.

TI  - Investigating a conventional and retrofit power plant on-board a Roll-on/Roll-off cargo ship from a sustainability perspective - A life cycle assessment case study
JO  - Energy Conversion And Management
PY  - 2016
VL  - 117
IS  - NA
AB  - Following the enforcement of MARPOL Annex VI Regulations for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships, retrofitting conventional power plants with emerging technologies is seen as a means to promote sustainability of marine transport and comply with more stringent emissions legislation. However, a knowledge gap exists as the environmental performance of retrofit power plant solutions incorporating emerging technologies has not been examined using an integrated system approach based on Life Cycle Assessment. The purpose of this research was to investigate if integrating selected emerging technologies i.e. photovoltaic systems, lithium-ion batteries, cold ironing and power-take-off/power-take-in systems supplemented by frequency converters and variable frequency drives into an existing power plant would be to the advantage of a chosen ship type i.e. Roll-on/Roll-off cargo ships, from the perspectives of resource consumption and environmental burden. Using the power plant of an existing vessel as a case study, it was found that cast iron, steel, copper and aluminium were the four materials most commonly consumed during manufacturing phase i.e. 2.9 Ã— 105 kg, 1.9 Ã— 105 kg, 5.3 Ã— 104 kg and 2.9 Ã— 104 kg respectively. By burning 2.9 Ã— 107 kg of heavy fuel oil and 2.3 Ã— 108 kg of marine diesel oil during operation, 8.2 Ã— 108 kg of carbon dioxide, 1.7 Ã— 107 kg of nitrogen oxides, 6.1 Ã— 106 kg of sulphur dioxide, 7.6 Ã— 105 kg of carbon monoxide, 6.5 Ã— 105 kg of hydrocarbon and 4.7 Ã— 105 kg of particulate matter would be released. Over a projected 30-year period, emissions released to air and freshwater were found to be significant. Based on 3 characterisation methodologies, ecotoxicity potential, with 7-10 orders of magnitude, was identified as the most significant environmental burden. Consuming and storing resources had the least impact, operating diesel engines and auxiliary generators had a moderate impact, and disposing metallic waste had the highest impact. The research concluded that the environmental burden caused by a marine power plant was significant but retrofitting existing power plant with suitable emerging technologies could reduce a number of impacts by 4-7 orders of magnitude, as verified via scenario analysis. However, the system should be designed and managed with due care as the environmental benefits, such as lower fuel consumption, emission reduction and performance improvement in some environmental measures are always achieved at the expense of an increase in other detrimental impacts.

AB  - This chapter presents a financial and operational analysis of a sea platform that is used for research purposes and is planned to be located north of Heraklion city, Crete Island. The operation of the platform will be based mainly on renewable energy technologies, such as photovoltaics and wind turbines. In order to utilize properly the renewable energy potential, the sea platform will also include batteries and diesel generator, whereas the option of grid interconnection with Crete Island is also examined, in order to purchase and sell its electricity when needed. The alternative options that are examined include different battery autonomy, various funding options, and sensitivity analysis of the results regarding different lending parameters. The financial indices used in this analysis are: net present value, internal rate of return, discounted payback period, and weighted average cost of capital. The results show that the operation of the sea platform can be economically viable if annual incomes of a few hundred thousand euros exist, provided by platforms research activities.

AB  - A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model is coupled with a suspended and bedload sediment transport model within the Thetis coastal ocean modelling framework. In investigating the effect of sediment transport on turbine array performance, we consider two artificial scenarios of 16 turbines deployed in aligned and staggered layouts to explore the impact of morphodynamics on power conversion. An optimisation algorithm is then applied to improve the position of turbines to maximize power output. Comparing this optimisation for a case with and without sediment transport we study the effect of morphodynamics on optimal layouts. The results show that sediment transport can significantly influence the performance of the aligned layout turbine array. As for the layout optimisation process, the inclusion of sediment transport makes little difference to the final results, while the computational cost becomes substantial when including the sediment model within the optimisation, even for a steady state case.

JO  - Proceedings Of The International Conference On Offshore Mechanics And Arctic Engineering - Omae
PY  - 2016
VL  - 6
IS  - NA
AB  - The aim of this paper is to maximize the power-to-load ratio of the Berkeley Wedge: a one-degree-of-freedom, asymmetrical, energy-capturing, floating breakwater of high performance that is relatively free of viscosity effects. Linear hydrodynamic theory was used to calculate bounds on the expected time-averaged power (TAP) and corresponding surge restraining force, pitch restraining torque, and power take-off (PTO) control force when assuming that the heave motion of the wave energy converter remains sinusoidal. This particular device was documented to be an almost-perfect absorber if one-degree-of-freedom motion is maintained. The success of such or similar future wave energy converter technologies would require the development of control strategies that can adapt device performance to maximize energy generation in operational conditions while mitigating hydrodynamic loads in extreme waves to reduce the structural mass and overall cost. This paper formulates the optimal control problem to incorporate metrics that provide a measure of the surge restraining force, pitch restraining torque, and PTO control force. The optimizer must now handle an objective function with competing terms in an attempt to maximize power capture while minimizing structural and actuator loads. A penalty weight is placed on the surge restraining force, pitch restraining torque, and PTO actuation force, thereby allowing the control fo-cus to be placed either on power absorption or load mitigation. Thus, in achieving these goals, a per-unit gain in TAP would not lead to a greater per-unit demand in structural strength, hence yielding a favorable benefit-to-cost ratio. Demonstrative results in the form of TAP, reactive TAP, and the amplitudes of the surge restraining force, pitch restraining torque, and PTO control force are shown for the Berkeley Wedge example.

JO  - Chemosphere
PY  - 2022
VL  - 299
IS  - NA
AB  - Climate change is leading to global sea level rise. Storm surges and higher tides will generate short-term `pulses' of seawater into freshwater systems, often for the first time in over 3000 years. The effect of increased seawater inundation upon soil geochemistry is poorly understood. We identified 12 sites in South Australia which are predicted to be inundated by seawater storm surges in the next 20 years. Within these 12 sites are three distinct environments; fresh water streams and lakes, hypersaline saltmarsh and mangroves, and acid sulfate soils. Soils were inundated with seawater under laboratory conditions to replicate a short-term (two weeks) inundation by a storm surge. Lowering of redox potential and dissolution of high concentrations of reactive Mn and Fe in freshwater environments lead to the release of dissolved Fe and Mn in the soils from freshwater environments. Soils also released As, Cu, Ni, Cd and Co, while Zn and Pb were less mobilised. Concentrations of metals released exceeded water quality guidelines to protect freshwater aquatic ecosystems in most cases. By comparison, hypersaline soils only released minor amounts of Mn, Fe, Cd and Ni, and only in some of the soils. The moderately acidic acid sulfate soil (pH 5.41) reductively dissolved Mn and Fe releasing significant amount of Fe and Mn as well as As, Cu, Ni, Cd and Co, whereas almost all metal species decreased in the porewaters of the strongly acidic acid sulfate soil (pH 2.77). The response to short-term seawater inundation in acid sulfate soils was dependent upon the baseline soil acidification status. This study highlights the need for further research on seawater inundation of coastal soils as sea levels rise and storm surges penetrate further inland.

AB  - Horizontal axis marine current turbine is a viable device which can harness kinetic energy from ocean currents. It is the closest concept to be commercialised among other marine turbines. Literature shows that computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models can accurately simulate turbine performance provided appropriate numerical techniques are employed. In this paper, the influence of different numerical approaches on the performance prediction of a two bladed turbine model was assessed by towing tank results from the USNA. Two turbulence models of k-Ï‰ SST and BSL EARSM as well as three boundary layer modeling techniques, including wall function, near wall region and transitional Gamma-Theta model, were compared. The effects of using steady state or transient solution methods by applying moving reference frame (MRF) and sliding mesh were investigated. Single blade simulation instead of whole turbine model was also evaluated together with the Reynold number effect. Although Transient solution with sliding mesh method offers a simulation closer to the real condition of turbine operation with accurate results, steady state MRF provides reasonable results while saving a significant computational time as well. Therefore, authors recommend utilising steady MRF simulation of whole turbine model using k-Ï‰ SST with wall-function model for performance prediction of horizontal axis marine current turbines in a balance between simulation time and results accuracy.

AB  - A recent expert elicitation showed that model validation remains one of the largest barriers for commercial wind farm control deployment. The Gaussian-shaped wake deficit model has grown in popularity in wind farm field experiments, yet its validation for larger farms and throughout annual operation remains limited. This article addresses this scientific gap, providing a model comparison of the Gaussian wind farm model with historical data of three offshore wind farms. The energy ratio is used to quantify the model's accuracy. We assume a fixed turbulence intensity of I-infinity = 6\% and a standard deviation on the inflow wind direction of sigma(wd) = 3 degrees in our Gaussian model. First, we demonstrate the non-uniqueness issue of I-infinity, and sigma(wd), which display a waterbed effect when considering the energy ratios. Second, we show excellent agreement between the Gaussian model and historical data for most wind directions in the Offshore Windpark Egmond aan Zee (OWEZ) and Westermost Rough wind farms (36 and 35 wind turbines, respectively) and wind turbines on the outer edges of the Anholt wind farm (110 turbines). Turbines centrally positioned in the Anholt wind farm show larger model discrepancies, likely due to deep-array effects that are not captured in the model. A second source of discrepancy is hypothesized to be inflow heterogeneity. In future work, the Gaussian wind farm model will be adapted to address those weaknesses.

AB  - Since 1 January 2016, the International Maritime Organization Tier III regulations concerning nitrogen oxides took effect. International Maritime Organization Tier III targets new ships weighing over 400 ton engaged in international sailing, especially those entering and leaving emission control areas. The number of emission control areas, including sulfur emission control areas, is forecasted to increase in Japanese seas and elsewhere; thus, all new ships intended for international sailing purposes must consider appropriate responses to these regulations. Currently, urea-selective catalytic reduction systems are frequently used to satisfy International Maritime Organization Tier III regulations in marine diesel engines, but these decrease ship engine performance due to increased engine exhaust gas pressure. Thus, following a study by Ryu et al., this research compares engine exhaust gas pressures at different engine loads (25\%, 30\%, 35\%, 40\%, 45\%, and 50\%) with the application of a thinner metal catalyst to a selective catalytic reduction reactor; metal catalyst thickness was reduced by 30\% or more from the original sheet thickness of 0.1 t. Furthermore, 40\% urea was injected into the exhaust gas line to conduct a comparative analysis of nitrogen oxide reduction. By changing the metal catalyst's sheet thickness, nitrogen oxide was reduced by more than 80\%, while the engine exhaust gas pressure was lowered by approximately 13\%-28\%.

IS  - NA
AB  - A coupled wave and hydrodynamic model was applied to the Kingston Basin of eastern Lake Ontario, a region with bathymetric variability due to channels and shoals, to assess the potential impacts on surface waves and wind-driven circulation of an offshore wind farm. The model was used to simulate a series of storm events with time-varying wind forcing and validated against wave, current and water level observations. The wind farm was simulated by adding semi-permeable structures in the surface wave model to represent the turbine monopiles, and by adding an energy loss term to the fluid momentum equations in the hydrodynamic model to represent the added drag of the monopiles on the flow. The results suggest that the wind farm would have a small influence on waves and circulation throughout the wind farm area, with spatial variability due to focussing of wave energy and re-direction of the flow. Overall, the results indicate that the wave height in coastal areas will be minimally affected with changes in significant wave height predicted to be &lt;3%. Larger changes to the strength of circulation occur inside the wind farm region with localized changes in current magnitude of up to 8cms-1. The results of this study may help to understand the impacts of future offshore wind farms and other offshore structures in the Great Lakes. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In today's environmentally conscious world maritime innovation is expected to reflect the increasing societal demands to minimize the impact of shipping on the environment. Current and future green ship are expected to comply against demanding environmental standards, requirements for new equipment and for sustainability within the context of lifecycle performance. And also there have been a lot of argument and discussion during the establishment of environmental convention and it is still on-going. The rationality or technical background are still challenged. However, it is to be stressed that the global measures to reduce the emission from the ship is agreed by all stakeholders and once the level playing field is given, no one is free from implementation of the common rules and regulation. Furthermore, there is a consensus that this will, in return, bring shipping and shipbuilding industries sustainable growth. This paper in view of above, I can conclude that first, designer and ship operators have to technically cooperate each other to find out what is the most appropriate method for reduction of emission from ships in view of vessels' usage although there exist some commercial barriers. Second, green ship technology is not necessary an innovative one. There are many technologies which become cost effective due to high oil price. Niche technology is also available. Third, EEDI is not the representation of overall vessel's energy efficiency. It should be monitored and lowered continuously in the future. Fourth, the benefit coming from fuel saving should be shared by all stakeholders in such a way that further development is made possible and that level playing of every stakeholders is also possible. Fifth, related R&D should be well recognized and coordinated, especially for the IT convergence technology. Â© 2017 International Information Institute.

TI  - On scale and magnitude of pressure build-up induced by large-scale geologic storage of CO2
JO  - Greenhouse Gases: Science And Technology
PY  - 2011
VL  - 1
IS  - 1
AB  - The scale and magnitude of pressure perturbation and brine migration induced by geologic carbon sequestration is discussed assuming a full-scale deployment scenario in which enough CO2 is captured and stored to make relevant contributions to global climate change mitigation. In this scenario, the volumetric rates and cumulative volumes of CO2 injection would be comparable to or higher than those related to existing deep-subsurface injection and extraction activities, such as oil production. Large-scale pressure build-up in response to the injection may limit the dynamic storage capacity of suitable formations, because over-pressurization may fracture the caprock, may drive CO2/brine leakage through localized pathways, and may cause induced seismicity. On the other hand, laterally extensive sedimentary basins may be less affected by such limitations because (i) local pressure effects are moderated by pressure propagation and brine displacement into regions far away from the CO2 storage domain; and (ii) diffuse and/or localized brine migration into overlying and underlying formations allows for pressure bleed-off in the vertical direction. A quick analytical estimate of the extent of pressure build-up induced by industrial-scale CO2 storage projects is presented. Also discussed are pressure perturbation and attenuation effects simulated for two representative sedimentary basins in the USA: the laterally extensive Illinois Basin and the partially compartmentalized southern San Joaquin Basin in California. These studies show that the limiting effect of pressure build-up on dynamic storage capacity is not as significant as suggested by Ehlig-Economides and Economides, who considered closed systems without any attenuation effects.

AB  - Macreadie et al (this issue; M2017 Environ. Res. Lett.) challenged the conclusion presented by Johannessen and Macdonald (2016 Environ. Res. Lett.) that global estimates of carbon sequestration by seagrass meadows were too high. Here we clarify our global calculation, respond to M2017's criticisms and explain how the persistent misunderstandings about sediment dynamics within the Blue Carbon community continue to lead to overestimates of carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows. We point out that, although seagrasses appear to have a local effect on carbon sequestration compared with nearby barren sediments, their preferred substrate (slowly-accumulating, coarse sediment) makes them among the least effective coastal environments for burying carbon. We conclude with a proposal for the development of robust international protocols to quantify carbon burial in seagrass meadows that account for sediment accumulation, sediment mixing and carbon remineralization.

PY  - 2012
VL  - 11

AB  - Geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most critical technologies in reducing anthropogenic and fossil fuel emissions to the atmosphere. The most critical scientific problem has been the selection of storage site for long-term safety, as well as reliable and reasonable estimation of CO2 storage capacity. This paper analyzed the stability effect factors in identifying the most suitable reservoir-seal assemblages in the Subei Basin in China. In this area, the Lower Yancheng Formation and the Upper Sanduo Formation were selected accurately based on analysis of their geomorphological and geological characteristics. Considering simultaneously the different tectonic units, cap-rock conditions, hydrodynamic conditions, and other factors, these formations could function as optimal reservoirs. The storage capacity in the aquifer layers hosted by these formations was estimated. The results showed that, on average, the storage capacity of the Lower Yancheng Formation is approximately 21.788 x 10(8) t, whereas that of the Upper Sanduo Formation is approximately 45.866 x 10(8) t. For the first-order tectonic units, the total storage capacity of the aforementioned two reservoir formations in the Yanfu Depression and the Dongtai Depression reaches 11.01 x 10(8) and 56.644 x 10(8) t, respectively, at the basin scale.

TI  - Reduced CO2 uptake and growing nutrient sequestration from slowing overturning circulation
JO  - Nature Climate Change
PY  - 2023
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Current Earth system models (ESMs) project dramatic slowing (28â€“42% by 2100) of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Southern Meridional Overturning Circulation (SMOC) across a range of climate scenarios, with a complete shutdown of SMOC possible by year 2300. Slowing meridional overturning circulation (MOC) differentially impacts the ocean biological and solubility carbon pumps, leaving the net impact on ocean carbon uptake uncertain. Here using a suite of ESMs, we show that slowing MOC reduces anthropogenic carbon uptake by the solubility pump but increases deep-ocean storage of carbon and nutrients by the biological pump. The net effect reduces ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2. The deep-ocean nutrient sequestration will increasingly depress global-scale, marine net primary production over time. MOC slowdown represents a positive feedback that could extend or intensify peak-warmth climate conditions on multi-century timescales.

TI  - Wildlife and infrastructure: impact of wind turbines on bats in the Black Sea coast region

VL  - 66
IS  - 3
AB  - In Eastern Europe, wind energy production is currently promoted as an important source of renewable energy, yet in most cases without appropriate consideration of the negative impacts wind turbines (WT) may have on protected species such as bats. Here, we present first data on fatality rates, fatality factors and the likely origin of bats killed by WT in the Dobrogea region (Romania), located in a major migratory corridor for wildlife in Eastern Europe. Over a 4-year period, we found a total of 166 bat carcasses from 10 species, mostly representing migratory species such as Pipistrellus nathusii and Nyctalus noctula. Most fatalities at WT occurred in July and August. We documented 15 cases of barotrauma and 34 cases of blunt-force trauma in carcasses found below WT. After adjusting for carcass removals and variations in searcher efficiency, we estimated for the 4-year study period a total of 2394 bat casualties at the studied WT facility consisting of 20 units, resulting in a mean fatality rate of 30 bats/WT/year, or 14.2 bats/MW/year. By implementing a curtailment measure at wind speeds below 6.5 m/s, we reduced fatality rates by 78\%. Isoscape origin models based on hydrogen stable isotope ratios in fur keratin revealed that the majority of N. noctula that were killed by WT or captured nearby in mist nets originated from distant areas in the North (Ukraine, Belarus, Russia). The estimated high fatalitjegangy rates of bats at WT in this area have far-reaching consequences, particularly for populations of migratory bats, if no appropriate mitigation schemes are practised.

TI  - Food safety during seaweed cultivation at offshore wind farms: An exploratory study in the North Sea

VL  - 120
IS  - NA
AB  - Multi-use in ocean space, and seas, entails the co-location of different industries or technologies and their corresponding activities that take place at the same time in a specific location. This concept focuses on finding solutions to tackle global challenges in food security. However, the effects that seaweed cultivation at offshore wind farms may have on food and feed safety are less readily addressed. This study examined whether currently available food and feed safety standards for seaweed can be applied to multi-use activities at sea. The focus was on the combined use of seaweed cultivation at an offshore wind farm in the North Sea. Literature regarding hazards in seaweed was screened, and standards were evaluated. Expert elicitation on seaweed cultivation was retrieved via in-depth interviews and a workshop. Results showed that although some food safety hazards may be more apparent for seaweed cultivation such as toxic metals (e.g., arsenic, cadmium) and iodine, others may become relevant when considering multi-use (e.g., allergens, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, toxic metabolites). Key factors for food safety include the location of seaweed cultivation, handling and processing of seaweed, and seaweed testing. Public standards, the Food Safety System Certification 22000 standard, and the Marine Stewardship Council/Aquaculture Stewardship Council standard are recommended for the food and marine sectors to consider when determining standards to implement. This case study provides an example of how to address seaweed food and feed safety in a multi-use scenario in the North Sea. We recommend additional case studies for other multi-use at sea scenarios.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 90
IS  - NA
AB  - Deterministic optimization algorithms generate optimal routes/paths and speeds along ship voyages. However, a ship can rarely follow pre-defined speeds because dynamic sea environments lead to continuous speed variation. In this paper, a voyage optimization method is proposed to optimize ship engine power to reduce fuel and air emissions. It is a combination of dynamic programming and genetic algorithm to solve voyage planning in three-dimensions. In this method, the engine power is discretized into several levels. The potential benefit of using this algorithm is investigated by a medium-size chemical tanker. A ship's actual sailing is used to demonstrate benefits of the proposed method. On average 3.4% of fuel-saving and emission reduction can be achieved than state-of-the-art deterministic methods. If compared with the actual full-scale measurements, on average 5.6% reduction of fuel consumption and GHG emissions (about 275 tons) can be expected by the proposed method for the six case study voyages.

JO  - Science Of The Total Environment
PY  - 2020
VL  - 711
IS  - NA
AB  - The fate of soil carbon in eroding coastal wetlands is of great concern, given the potential for a feedback loop from coastal wetland soil that would dramatically increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The biogeochemical transformations and overall fate of this soil carbon upon coastal erosion were investigated through geophysical and spectroscopic analysis of soil and associated dissolved organic matter. Bay water and core sections were collected across transects encompassing both intact and eroded, submerged, sections of a coastal marsh in Barataria Bay, Louisiana. We noted: i) a vertical increase in carbon content, humification of organic matter, and decrease in biotic degradation with depth at all sites; ii) an erosion and ultimate collapse of the top ~ 0â€“20 cm of the intact marsh's edge into the bay water due to the undercutting caused by tidal/wave forces; iii) the loss of the stored carbon from the submerged site's top 10 cm layer; and iv) leaching, dilution, abiotic, and biotic degradation of the marsh carbon due to the exposure to the bay water. This erosion and degradation of wetland soil carbon stores demonstrates the potential impact of rising sea levels on the future fate of coastal wetland carbon and atmospheric CO2 levels.

AB  - Development of subsurface SWRO intake systems along the shoreline or in the nearshore environment requires careful evaluation before they can be successfully developed. These environments are zones of high energy and changes that impact the long-term viability of subsurface intake systems. A key aspect for evaluation is a detailed analysis of the sediment budget and transport system along the beach and nearshore environments. Erosion of the shoreline or rapid deposition could cause the failure of many subsurface intake systems, especially beach and offshore gallery intakes. Both the seasonal fluctuations in shoreline profiles and the long-term trends in sedimentation must be evaluated. Large capacity subsurface SWRO intake systems, such as that proposed at Huntington Beach, California, require an optimal siting and evaluation analysis to be conducted using modern modeling and analytical methods. A detailed summary of global littoral and nearshore processes as related to the design and construction of subsurface intake systems is presented with a detailed analysis showing how the natural system was evaluated to select a stable site for a seabed gallery (infiltration) system at Huntington Beach, California, which is a high energy shoreline that creates considerable challenges in siting and construction.

PY  - 2009
VL  - 48
IS  - 2
AB  - The main objective of this paper is to enhance the overall performance of Marine Diesel Engine power plant onboard passenger and container ships through a proposed fresh water generator and combined heat and power system. Fresh water produced will be used for drinking, cleaning and washing purposes, contributing to the high demand consumption particularly onboard passenger ships. The main idea for the proposed fresh water generator is to use the waste heat recovered from scavenging air to provide the heat required to evaporate sea water under vacuum converting it into steam. Energy conservation system for exhaust gases in container ships has a lot of advantages which include reducing fuel consumption for ships, increasing the overall efficiency and reducing the pollutant emissions which go out into the atmosphere. Results of the suggested fresh water generator indicated that for a typical installed propulsion power of 3350 hp consuming 10 ton of fuel oil per day, 8 tons of fresh water will be produced. This amount will be sufficient for 20 persons per day. For a number of diesel engines equipped with the proposed fresh water generator the specific fresh water generation was found to be about 100 gm/hp/hr. Combined heat and power plant is one of the methods used to improve engine performances and a better environment which can reduce emissions and fuel consumption by 4.5%.

AB  - This paper presents optimal generation scheduling for minimization of fuel consumption (FC) in a typical offshore support vessel with DC power system architecture employing four identical diesel generator (DG) sets. FC is analyzed for (i) equal load sharing among DGs in AC architecture, (ii) equal load sharing among DGs in DC architecture and (iii) optimal load sharing among DGs in DC architecture using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Due to the presence of non-linearity in Specific FC (SFC) curves of the diesel engines, the PSO algorithm is used. The SFC-vs-load relationship obtained from Brake SFC (BSFC) map of the diesel engines is characterized using a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) interpolation. A solution to problem has been attained by comparing yearly fuel consumption in the three cases for the load profile of target vessel. This method can be applied to any vessel equipped with multiple generation units having DC power system architecture. Â© 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Recently, the shipping industry has been under increasing pressure to improve its environmental impact with a target of a 50\% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, compared to the 2008 levels. For this reason, great attention has been placed on alternative zero-carbon fuels, specifically ammonia, which is considered a promising solution for shipping decarbonisation. In this respect, a novel ammonia-powered fuel-cell configuration is proposed as an energy-efficient power generation configuration with excellent environmental performance. However, there are safety and reliability concerns of the proposed ammonia-powered system that need to be addressed prior to its wider acceptance by the maritime community. Therefore, this is the first attempt to holistically examine the safety, operability, and reliability of an ammonia fuel-cell-powered ship, while considering the bunkering and fuel specifications. The proposed methodology includes the novel combination of a systematic preliminary hazard identification process with a functional and model-based approach for simulating the impact of various hazards. Furthermore, the critical faults and functional failures of the proposed system are identified and ranked according to their importance. This work can be beneficial for both shipowners and policymakers by introducing technical innovation and for supporting the future regulatory framework.

AB  - People relay upon oil for primary energy and this for a few more decades. Other orthodox sources may be more enduring, but are not without serious disadvantages. Power from natural resources has always had great appeal. Coal is plentiful, though there is concern about despoliation in winning it and pollution in burning it. Nuclear power has been developed with remarkable timeliness, but is not universally welcomed, construction of the plant is energy-intensive and there is concern about the disposal of its long-lived active wastes. Barrels of oil, lumps of coal, even uranium come from nature but the possibilities of almost limitless power from the atmosphere and the oceans seem to have special attraction. The wind machine provided an early way of developing motive power. The massive increases in fuel prices over the last years have however, made any scheme not requiring fuel appear to be more attractive and to be worth reinvestigation. In considering the atmosphere and the oceans as energy sources the four main contenders are wind power, wave power, tidal and power from ocean thermal gradients. The renewable energy resources are particularly suited for the provision of rural power supplies and a major advantage is that equipment such as flat plate solar driers, wind machines, etc., can be constructed using local resources and without the advantage results from the feasibility of local maintenance and the general encouragement such local manufacture gives to the build up of small-scale rural based industry. This chapter gives some examples of small-scale energy converters, nevertheless it should be noted that small conventional i.e., engines are currently the major source of power in rural areas and will continue to be so for a long time to come. There is a need for some further development to suit local conditions, to minimise spares holdings, to maximise interchangeability both of engine parts and of the engine application. Emphasis should be placed on full local manufacture.

AB  - Emission reduction targets are driving a new way of thinking and a range of technological solutions within the shipping and port sectors. So far, four major solutions have been identified for cleaner ship fuels: (i) Marine Gas Oil, (ii) Heavy Fuel Oil + Scrubber, (iii) Liquefied Natural Gas - herein referred to as LNG, and (iv) Methanol. From those alternatives, most experts recognise LNG as the most developed fuel solution, both in the short- and in the medium-term. In 2014, the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) as well as the International Gas Union (IGU) reported a significant growth of terminals for LNG liquefaction and regasification. Moreover, the European Commission, as part of its Clean Power for Transport package, has adopted in 2014 a Directive `on the deployment of alternative fuels, recharging and refuelling infrastructure'. Nevertheless, there are several constraints that need to be addressed yet, more particularly in LNG importing countries in order to meet the future demand of the expected LNG-powered fleet. They include facilities for storage and transhipment of LNG for fuelling berths, barges and ships. This paper provides an overview of the use of LNG for the maritime industry and examines its potential for future growth on the basis of the LNG-powered fleet (current and in order) and planned expansion of LNG bunkering facilities, mainly in European ports. Most data here presented come from a variety of sources including international databases such as IHS Maritime, ports websites, and reports from LNG-related organisations. In addition, the results from past and current EU-funded projects in this field were reviewed and consultations were conducted among representatives from participating ports. Overall, it was found that the LNG powered fleet is expanding slowly and the trend is towards building LNG-propelled vessels for smaller ship sizes and short distances. Although Norway is the newbuilding front runner, other countries, mainly in Europe (e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, and Malta), have ordered an important amount of new buildings. Similarly, European ports are expanding considerably their LNG bunkering capacities. Remarkable are the activities conducted by the ports of Spain and Italy with planned expansion for LNG handling and storage facilities beyond 2020. Finally, with regards to regulations, while international standards have been adopted for the construction and operation of LNG powered ships and crew's training, no harmonisation exists yet for LNG facilities in ports. The latter have allowed major ports to undertake independent initiatives to overcome the situation. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The growing trend of the cruise ship industry, together with increasing concerns over its impact on the environment, makes these ships a much relevant target for the efforts toward increasing ship energy efficiency, thus ultimately reducing fuel consumption and emissions of carbon dioxide and other air pollutants. In a context of rising discussions concerning the use of cleaner fuels such as LNG and methanol in shipping, fuel cells are expected to become an increasingly viable solution for onboard power generation. In particular, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) can offer high electrical efficiency, power density and reliability with the possibility of combined heat, hydrogen and power production, which make them suitable for energy-intensive applications with a diverse demand (e.g., cruise ships) by integrating other complementary technologies. In this paper, we investigate the potential for energy and emission savings in relation to the use of SOFCs on cruise ships. Given the limited ability of SOFCs to deal with fast load changes and start/stop cycles, the SOFCs are expected to tackle the baseload, while a combination of batteries and internal combustion engines are complementary for handling peak loads. The proposed system is tested and optimized for a case study of a cruise ship operating in the Baltic Sea. Based on reference operational profiles for heat and electricity demand, the design of the system is optimized. The system proves particularly performant, with an overall efficiency close to 70% and a potential lifetime economic performance in line with conventional systems powered by Diesel engines.

JO  - Chemosphere
PY  - 2020
VL  - 244
IS  - NA
AB  - The increase levels of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in mangrove wetlands is of concern due to its potential toxic impacts on ecosystem. A 93-day greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of mangrove plants, A. marina and K. obovata, on TBBPA degradation in sediment and to reveal the associated contributing factor(s) for its degradation. Results show that both mangrove species could uptake, translocate, and accumulate TBBPA from mangrove sediments. Compared to the unplanted sediment, urease and dehydrogenase activity as well as total bacterial abundance increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the sediment planted with mangrove plants, especially for K. obovata. In the mangrove-planted sediment, the Anaerolineae genus was the dominant bacteria, which has been reported to enhance TBBPA dissipation, and its abundance increased significantly in the sediment at early stage (0 35 day) of the greenhouse experiment. Compared to A. marina-planted sediment, higher enrichment of Geobater, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Azoarcus, all of which could stimulate TBBPA degradation, was observed for the K. obovata-planted sediment during the 93-day growth period. Our mass balance result has suggested that plant-induced TBBPA degradation in the mangrove sediment is largely due to elevated microbial activities and total bacterial abundance in the rhizosphere, rather than plant uptake. In addition, different TBBPA removal efficiencies were observed in the sediments planted with different mangrove species. This study has demonstrated that K. obovata is a more suitable mangrove species than A. marina when used for remediation of TBBPA-contaminated sediment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work quantified the total carbon and 12 other sediment characteristics at 10 soil depths, in planted and or natural mangrove forests in comparison with non-vegetated soil for four seasons of the year 2009â€“2010 in the Vellar-Coleroon estuarine complex, India. The sediment characteristics varied significantly between mangrove-vegetated and non-vegetated habitats or seasons of analysis, but not between soil depths. The mangrove sediments were rich in total carbon and total organic carbon as compared to non-mangrove sediments (p <0.01). Total carbon was 98.2% higher in mature mangroves and 41.8% in planted mangroves than that in non-mangrove soil. Total organic carbon was as much as 2.5 times greater in mature mangroves and 2 times greater in planted mangroves than that in unvegetated soil. Carbon contents also varied many fold by season. Total carbon content was 8.6 times greater during pre-monsoon, 4.1 times greater during post-monsoon and 2.5 times greater during monsoon than during summer (p<0.01 in all cases). Similarly, total organic carbon was 5.9 times greater during pre-monsoon, 3.1 times greater during post-monsoon and 69% greater during monsoon than during summer. In general, higher levels of sediment carbon were recorded during pre and post-monsoon seasons than during other seasons. Total carbon concentration was correlated negatively to temperature, sand and phosphorus (p <0.01); positively correlated with redox potential, silt, clay, C/N ratio, potassium (p <0.01) and nitrogen (p <0.05); but not correlated with soil depth, pH or salinity. This work revealed that the carbon burial was rapid at the annual rate of 2.8% for total carbon, and 6.7% for total organic carbon in mangrove-planted sediment. Clearing of mangroves can result in significantly and rapidly reduced carbon stores. Our study highlights the importance of natural and plantation mangrove stands for conserving sediment carbon in the tropical coastal domain.

PY  - 2020

AB  - The shipping industry is responsible for 3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, emissions mainly resulting from the combustion of fuels in naval energy aggregates. The current requirements for a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 represent a challenge for maritime transport, as there is no effective solution to reduce this emissions from ships. Thus, the current problem is represented by insufficient methods to reduce COx2 emissions on board ships, in particular for ships which are in service for more than 10 years, which are the most affected by these environmental requirements, since their design did not take into account the reduction of ecological parameters. In this context, even if military vessels are not subject to IMO GHG emission reduction requirements, they must be aligned with global emissions reduction efforts. This article presents actually operational and technological solutions to reduce COx2 emissions that can be deployed on board military vessels, until other technical solutions or power supply solutions for non-polluting renewable energy aggregates are identified.

AB  - Mitigating human contributions to climate change is a highly debated topic, as it becomes evident that many nations do not adhere to optional reductions in global emission. Substantial research is taking place into negative carbon technologies that actively reduce the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) via greenhouse gas removal (GGR). Various GGR methods have been proposed, from reforestation to ocean fertilisation. This article discusses advantages of an approach based on enhanced input of tephra to the ocean, to increase the drawdown of atmospheric CO2. Natural addition of tephra to the ocean results in preservation of enhanced organic matter in sediment. Hence, augmenting its delivery should raise the level of sequestration. Calculations indicate that offshore tephra addition could sequester 2750 tonnes of CO2 per 50,000 tonnes of ash delivered (a typical bulk carrier's capacity). The cost is estimated as similar to\$55 per tonne of CO2 sequestered and is an order of magnitude cheaper than many proposed GGR technologies. Further advantages include: tephra addition is simply an augmentation of a natural Earth process, it is a low technology approach that requires few developments, and it may sequester carbon for thousands of years. Hence, offshore tephra addition warrants further investigation to assess its viability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The improvement of ship operation efficiency and the environmental protection are the main pillars for a competitive and sustainable shipping industry. This sustainability depends on the fluctuation of the fuel price market, compulsory international maritime organization environmental regulations and the shipowners policy regarding the energy-saving and their commitment in the reduction of greenhouse gas emission. To ensure a sustainable competitiveness and compliance with environmental requirements of their fleets, the shipping companies have implemented several innovative solutions. Some innovative solutions might be implemented at ship design stage, while others might be implemented at ship operation stage. This paper focuses on the solutions which might be implemented at the operation stage, i.e. ship speed optimization, weather routing optimization, ship trim optimization and hull and propeller condition based maintenance. The effectiveness of these solutions has been demonstrated through study of ship voyages performance reports and simulation of case study. Â© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

JO  - Energy For Sustainable Development
PY  - 1995

IS  - 1
AB  - Denmark has a long tradition of wind power development dating back to the 1890s. This provided a professional basis for the introduction of wind power in Denmark during the first two decades of this century and later during the Second World War. That phase of Danish wind power development culminated with the 200 kW Gedser mill operating from 1959 to 1967 with great reliability. After the oil crisis in 1973, a new phase of Danish wind power development was initiated. Using the basic concept from the Gedser mill, a government-sponsored programme has led to a strong commercial development of Danish wind turbines. In the late seventies, typical Danish turbines had power ratings around 20 kW. Today, 500 to 600 kW turbines are commercially available. As of early 1995 more than 500 MW of wind electric capacity is installed in Denmark, covering about 3.5% of Danish electricity demand. The official target is to cover 10% of electricity demand by the year 2005. The corresponding installed capacity would amount to 1300 to 1500 MW. Recently, growing local opposition to the Danish wind programme has delayed the development toward the official target for 2005. The Danish government is now taking new initiatives in order to overcome this barrier, including increased pressure on municipalities and development of new offshore sites for wind farms. Another barrier may be introduced by a single energy market in the EU which does not fully incorporate externalities in the market price. Long-range coverage of more than 25% of Danish electricity demand by wind is a realistic goal, especially if a close coupling with Norwegian hydropower can be established.

TI  - CARBON EMISSIONS FROM CONTAINER SHIPPING: AN ANALYSIS OF NEW EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE
JO  - International Journal Of Transport Economics
PY  - 2015
VL  - 42
IS  - 2, SI
AB  - In the last decade researchers have been looking at ways of reducing the carbon intensity of shipping operations that globally account for approximately 3 \% of world carbon emissions. As a result of regulation and firms' efforts to innovate, the maritime sector has introduced new technologies and practices such as slow steaming which have contributed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. The impact of technological and operational developments on global GHG emissions is difficult to assess, however, without empirical evidence. So far such evidence has been only partially available and most of the data sources used in the literature have been compiled for different purposes or are based on single firm case studies. This paper reports the results of an analysis of a fuel consumption database compiled by the BSR Clean Cargo Working Group (CCWG) with the specific purpose of benchmarking and collecting emission data and comprising 2,300 container ship voyages (reporting year 2013, data for 2012). This analysis has examined the effect of technical and operational parameters on these vessels' fuel consumption and emissions and is the first to be performed on the dataset and in general on self-reported data across multiple companies. In 2012, carriers in the CCWG accounted for approximately 65\% of total world deep-sea container traffic. The paper outlines an econometric model that regresses carbon emissions from container shipping on particular trade routes against a range of independent variables, such as vessel age, size and average speed. The paper results indicate that significant differences exist among carriers both in terms of energy efficiency and carbon intensity. The analysis also suggests that while the emission profiles of some trade routes have remained relatively stable in recent years, others have witnessed an increase in emissions mainly as a result of a concentration of container flows. By improving our understanding of the determinants of carbon emissions from container shipping, this research should help shipping lines develop carbon-reduction plans and governments to devise appropriate policies to incentivise the decarbonisation of the maritime sector.

JO  - Waste Management
PY  - 1997
VL  - 17
IS  - 5-6
AB  - Ocean carbon cycle modeling is expected to play a key role in decisions concerning the purposeful sequestration of CO2 in the oceans. Modeling is probably the only practical way to know how much good sequestration is doing, or would do if implemented, since even with sequestration, atmospheric CO2 would be expected to continue to increase because of the release of non-sequestered CO2 and the return to the atmosphere of sequestered CO2, We have employed a carbon cycle model based on an ocean general circulation model to estimate the return of sequestered CO2 to the atmosphere for sequestration in the pre-industrial ocean at sites near Tokyo, San Francisco, New York and Miami. Significant differences in the effectiveness of sequestration are found. Off the East Coast of the USA, the atmospheric concentration due to the return of sequestered CO2 quickly rises to near the final equilibrium value, for all depths below about 800 m. Off the West Coast of the USA, the CO2 is effectively hidden from the atmosphere for several hundred years, for depths below 800 m. Then the atmospheric concentration rises to larger values than for sequestration off the East Coast. Sequestration off the coast of Japan at 800 m is similar to sequestration off the West Coast of the USA, but without the time delay. These predicted differences are understandable in terms of ocean circulation. Sequestration in the post-industrial ocean beginning in the year 2000 has been modeled also and sites near Tokyo acid New York. This calculation includes additional CO2 from a representation of anthropogenic CO2 for the entire fossil fuel era. No-sequestered CO2 tends to flush the sequestered CO2 out of the ocean by reducing the concentration of the carbonate ion, with which CO2 reacts. Results are less favorable in the post-industrial ocean. The pre-industrial ocean model can help in the selection of location and depth, but the post-industrial ocean model is more realistic. ``Thus human beings are now carrying out a large scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future. Within a few centuries we are returning to the atmosphere and oceans the concentrated organic carbon stored in sedimentary rocks over hundreds of millions of years{''} Roger Revelle and Hans Suess.(1) (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced a new measure in 2011 with a set of technical innovation and performance standards to increase the energy efficiency of new ships at the design stage and aim to reduce CO2 emissions. This new measure is called Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and this became a fast key instrument for the ships to be energy efficient. In this paper, one of the passenger ships in the Istanbul Strait was investigated and its emissions were estimated. The Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) of the ship was calculated. EEDI formula equations based on the study of passenger ships have been compared with the IMO other ship equations and some useful proposals have been presented to reduce the harmful effects of CO2 exhaust gas emission.

In Germany the installed wind power capacity already exceeded 19 GW and expected to reach 50 GW by the year 2020. For the connection of large offshore wind farms to the onshore AC grid DC transmission technologies can be used for which suitable submarine cables are necessary. German utilities defined grid code requirements on wind turbines spelling out the necessary grid-conform behavior. The most important obligations on wind generation plant operators concern fault-ride through and reactive power supply in steady state and during grid faults. The authors discuss the main issues contained in the revised German Grid Code released in 2006. For incorporating wind turbines and wind farms into power system stability studies, suitable models are presented. The behavior of a typical wind farm during three phase grid fault based on simulation results is shown.

AB  - The article focuses on a specific environmental evaluation method - Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and it estimates biofuel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and compares to fossil fuels. It is mainly evaluated by the mean Global Warming impact indicator, expressed in grams of CO2 equivalent per MJ of energy (gCO2eqÂ·MJ-1). Biofuels are highly relevant renewable energy options on a global scale. Comparing with fossil fuels, biofuels in some cases can be carbon neutral or even carbon negative and play an important role in the reduction of GHG emissions. A number of LCA have shown that first generation biofuels provide a little to no benefit for GHG reductions compared to fossil fuels, particularly when indirect effects are considered. LCAs of second and third generation biofuels exhibit great variability and uncertainty but are intended to achieve greater GHG reductions. Highly possible Arctic Ocean ice meltdown in the late summer as soon as in September 2015 and accelerated methane hydrate destabilization in the Arctic Ocean seabed via ocean warming could cause abrupt climate change in the following decade. Mitigation of climate change requires to use only biofuels with the global warming impact indicator close to 0 gCO2eqÂ·MJ-1 (Carbon Neutral) or - gCO2eqÂ·MJ-1 (Carbon Negative).

JO  - Scientific Reports
PY  - 2021

AB  - Coastal reclamation seriously disturbs coastal wetland ecosystems, while its influences on soil microbial communities remain unclear. In this study, we examined the impacts of coastal reclamation on soil microbial communities based on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis following the conversion of Phragmites australis wetlands to different land use types. Coastal reclamation enhanced total soil microbial biomass and various species (i.e., gram-positive bacterial, actinomycete, saturated straight-chain, and branched PLFA) following the conversion of P. australis wetland to aquaculture pond, wheat, and oilseed rape fields. In contrast, it greatly decreased total soil microbial biomass and various species following the conversion of P. australis wetland to town construction land. Coastal reclamation reduced fungal:bacterial PLFA, monounsaturated:branched PLFA ratios, whereas increasing gram-positive:gram-negative PLFA ratio following the conversion of P. australis wetland to other land use types. Our study suggested that coastal reclamation shifted soil microbial communities by altering microbial biomass and community composition. These changes were driven primarily by variations in soil nutrient substrates and physiochemical properties. Changes in soil microbial communities following coastal reclamation impacted the decomposition and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, with potential modification of carbon and nitrogen sinks in the ecosystems, with potential feedbacks in response to climate change.

AB  - This study investigates the relationships between emission reduction, long-term orientation, green strategy, and green innovation among maritime vessel-owning firms of various sizes in the Norwegian maritime sector. A change from the utilization of fossil fuels and move toward more sustainable sources of energy demand substantial financial investments and behavioral changes but are fundamental to preventing further climate change. This study examines the greening of the Norwegian fleet through a structural equation model based upon 246 survey responses. Although our model does not show a significant direct relationship between long-term orientation and emission reductions, we do find that long-term orientation is indirectly related to emission reductions because of its relationships with green strategy and green innovation. Moreover, as mediators, green innovation and green strategy share direct associations with firms' reductions of greenhouse gases and environmentally harmful emissions. Implications for practitioners and policy makers are proposed.

AB  - Two representative zones in Chongming Dongtan which faced the Yangtze River and East China Sea respectively were selected to study the variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) reservation capability between coastal wetland and riverside wetland in the Chongming Dongtan wetland as well as its mechanism by analyzing soil characteristics and plant biomass. The results showed the SOC content of riverside wetland was only 48.61\% (P = 0.000 < 0.05) that of coastal wetland. As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors. Therefore the low salinity of the riverside area was suitable for the growth of microorganisms, especially beta-Proteobacteria and some specific bacteria, which led to the high SMR and low SOC reservation capability when compared to the coastal area.

AB  - Renewable energy resources are getting increased attention from researchers because of depleting fossil resources, increasing fuel prices and the concern of climate change and global warming. In a country like India where long coastal line is available, offshore wind farms are one of the attractive options. Over last two decades the wind power penetration in to the grid is increasing at a very fast rate and therefore the wind farms are now required to participate actively in grid operation by an appropriate generation control. The advantage of using a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator for wind energy conversion systems is that its efficiency is higher compared to other variable speed WT configurations, its full scale converter allows full controllability, gearbox can be omitted by using higher number of poles of PMSG. This paper proposes the complete modeling and simulation, and analysis of a PMSG based WECS in terms of its power quality, range of wind speed that it can handle and the power balance when the machine is operating under varying wind velocity conditions. Vector control strategy is employed for both the converters connected, in cascade, between generator and the power grid. The WECS is analyzed under both partial and full-load regime. Generator control is applied for power optimization when wind speed is less than rated speed and pitch control is applied for speeds higher than rated speed but below cut-out speed. Â© 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Aquaculture in coastal environments has an increasingly important role in the world's food supply; however, the accumulation of organic compounds on seafloors due to overfeeding adversely affects benthic ecosystems. To assess the ecological resilience of aquafarms to nutrient influx, we investigated the redox homeostasis of benthic ecosystems using a marine oligochaete as a model benthic organism in aquaculture fields. Real-time monitoring of the redox potential of a model benthic ecosystem constructed in an electrochemical reactor allowed evaluation of the homeostatic response of the system to nutrient addition. Although the detrimental effects of overfeeding were confirmed by irreversible potential changes in the sediment, redox homeostasis was reinforced through a cooperative relationship between oligochaetes and sediment microorganisms. Specifically, the oligochaetes exhibited reversible changes in metabolism and body position in response to dynamic changes in the sediment potential between -300 and 500 mV, thereby promoting the decomposition of organic compounds. The potential-dependent changes in metabolism and body position were reproduced by artificially manipulating the sediment potential in electrochemical reactors. Given the importance of benthic animals in sustaining coastal ecosystems, the electrochemical monitoring and physiologic regulation of marine oligochaetes could offer an intriguing approach toward sustainable aquaculture.

AB  - Fossil derived fuels available for application within the maritime sector have been dominated by heavy fuel oil (HFO), which is conventionally used in low speed (main) engines, and more refined fuels such as marine diesel oil (MDO), which is consumed in fast or medium speed engines. However, increasing fuel costs and regulatory pressure such as the restrictions placed on sulphur content have increased interest in the use of alternative fuels. A number of alternative fuels have been identified and may be viable for use within the maritime sector including straight vegetable oil (SVO) as an alternative to HFO in low speed engines, biodiesel to replace MDO/MGO in low to medium speed engines and bio-liquefied natural gas (bio-LNG) in gas engines using LNG. The potential sources of biomass feedstocks, conversion pathways and technologies are identified. The key parameters limiting their potential application are examined, in particular, availability, technological development, technical integration, and operational consequences. A proposed solution to overcome these limitations is recommended. The effective implementation of these strategies will enable the more widespread use of biofuels in marine applications, significantly reducing emissions from ships and improving global air quality and also protecting the ecological environment.

AB  - The utilization of green energy resources for supplying energy to ships in the marine industry has received increasing attention during the last years, where different green resource combinations and control strategies have been used. This article considers a ferry ship supplied by fuel cells (FCs) and batteries as the main sources of ship's power. Based on the designers' and owners' preferences, different scenarios can be considered for managing the operation of the FCs and batteries in all-electric marine power systems. In this article, while considering different constraints of the system, six operating scenarios for the set of FCs and batteries are proposed. Impacts of each proposed scenario on the optimal daily scheduling of FCs and batteries and operation costs of the ship are calculated using a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. Model predictive control (MPC) is also applied to consider the deviations from hourly forecast demand. Moreover, since the efficiency of FCs varies for different output powers, the impacts of applying a linear model for FCs' efficiency are compared with the proposed nonlinear model and its related deviations from the optimal operation of the ship are investigated. The proposed model is solved by GAMS software using actual system data and the simulation results are discussed. Finally, detailed real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulation outcomes and comparative analysis are presented to confirm the adaptation capability of the proposed strategy.

The elimination of crew, the introduction of innovative technology and adoption of new ship design on board of this kind of ship will participate positively in energy saving and environmental protection. For an insitu study, a hundred of conventional ships (CS) have been visited, their energy consumption and environmental impact are assessed taking into consideration the trading area, navigation scenarios, power capacity and number of crew members. In this paper, we assess and quantify the positive impact on energy saving and environmental pollution prevention resulting from the implementation of AS. For this the facilities related to crew living are enumerated and the impact of their elimination on energy saving and environmental pollution prevention is presented. Other ship design concepts are proposed to enhance the energy-saving and environmental protection are proposed. A benchmarking of CS and AS in term of energy saving and environmental pollution prevention is presented.

The original mixed integer non-linear mathematical model is linearized and solved efficiently using CPLEX. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate changes in the vessel schedule that a liner shipping company has to make for a given shipping route, when emissions constraints are imposed.

AB  - The study aims to reduce the environmental pollutants produced in the ship transportation in the environment of energy shortage, and realize the comprehensive development of energy saving and emission reduction. Based on the theoretical basis of chemical kinetics, a new type of NOx emission generation model of marine diesel engine was proposed according to the traditional HB model. Second, the combustion chemical kinetics of sulfide was described, on which the sulfide generation and emission model of marine diesel engine was proposed. Third, the characteristics of NO, N2O and SO2 were analyzed according to the emission model of NOx and sulfide generation in marine diesel engine. The results showed that when the crankshaft angle was 230Â° and 250Â°CA, the content of NO and N2O in the exhaust pipe of diesel engine had an obvious peak. The content of NO and N2O in the cylinder and exhaust pipe of diesel engine increased at the beginning. As the crankshaft angle increased, the content of both decreased gradually, and the trend of change in the cylinder was slower than that in the exhaust pipe. The SO2 content in the diesel cylinder kept stable after a small increase until it disappeared. The SO2 content in the exhaust pipe first increased and then decreased. When the crankshaft angle was 230Â°CA, the SO2 content in the exhaust pipe of the diesel engine had an obvious peak. The emission characteristics of nitrogen oxide and sulfide were consistent with the correct change trend, which conformed to the theoretical mechanism. In a word, the study provides a practical basis for energy conservation and emission reduction, development of low-carbon economy, and efficient use of energy.

TI  - Modeling of twin-turbine systems with vertical axis tidal current turbine: Part IItorque fluctuation
JO  - Ocean Engineering
PY  - 2011
VL  - 38
IS  - 4
AB  - We recently showed the advantage of using a numerical system to extract energy from tidal currents by developing a new twin-turbine model (Li and Calisal, 2010a). Encouraged by this result, we decided to use this model to study another important characteristic of the turbine system, torque fluctuation. This effort is summarized in this paper. The torque fluctuation is expected to reduce the fatigue life of tidal current turbines, though potentially it also may deteriorate the power quality of tidal current turbines. In this paper, after reviewing the twin-turbine model, we use it to predict the torque fluctuation of the system with the same configurations as we used to study the power output in Li and Calisal (2010a). Specifically, we investigate the torque fluctuation of twin-turbine systems with various turbine parameters (e.g.; relative distance between two turbines and incoming flow angle) and operational condition (e.g.; tip speed ratio). The results suggest that the torque of an optimally configured twin-turbine system fluctuates much less than that of the corresponding stand-alone turbine, under the same operating conditions. We then extensively compare the hydrodynamic interaction's impact on the torque fluctuation and the power output of the system. We conclude that the hydrodynamic interactions pose more constructive impacts on the torque fluctuation than on the power output. The findings indicate that the optimally configured counter-rotating system should be a side-by-side system, and that the optimally configured co-rotating system should have the downstream turbine partially in the wake of the upstream turbine depending on the detailed configuration of the turbines. Furthermore, one must balance the optimal torque fluctuation against the optimal power output. Â© 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective To test the hypothesis that blood pressure of older adults with high resting end tidal CO2 (PETCO(2)) is sensitive to high dietary intake of sodium chloride. Design and methods Forty-four Caucasian men and women, aged 41-79 years (mean +/- SEM 55.5 +/- 1.4), restricted their dietary intake of sodium chloride for 11 days and ingested sodium chloride capsules (an additional 190 mmol sodium/day) during the last seven of those days, On days 1, 4 and 11, resting PETCO(2) and blood pressure were monitored for 25 min in the laboratory, followed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in the natural environment for 24 h, Overnight urine samples were obtained at days 4 and 11 to estimate excretion of sodium and of an endogenous digitalis-like factor (EDLF) that is sensitive to changes in plasma volume, Results Individual resting PETCO, remained stable within and between laboratory monitoring sessions and was correlated with urinary excretion of the endogenous digitalislike factor, both before and after the period of high sodium intake, The high-sodium diet was associated with increased urinary sodium excretion and body weight in all quartiles of PETCO(2). The high-sodium diet produced significant increases in resting and in 24 h systolic blood pressures in the upper two quartiles of the PETCO(2) distribution, and significant increases in resting and in 24 h diastolic blood pressures in the highest PETCO(2) quartile only, Conclusion These findings indicate that blood pressure sensitivity to sodium loading is differentially associated with high resting PETCO(2) in older adults, A high PETCO(2) may be an index of a dynamic steady state that influences sodium transport mechanisms.

AB  - This study investigates frequency response tuning for a two-body heaving wave energy converter. The wave energy converter presented is a scale model "spar-float" configuration to be tested at the National Research Council Institute for Ocean Technology, St. Johns, Newfoundland. The purpose of these tests is to validate a novel tuning mechanism which affords active adjustment of the spar natural frequency. In this work, a systematic optimization procedure is used to demonstrate the utility of this tuning mechanism. The spar geometry is parameterized so that the reference depth can be input to a simplified heaving dynamics model which utilizes the long-wavelength approximation. Closed form solutions to the linear heaving dynamics model are used to establish objective functions. For a range of wave frequencies corresponding to the wave tank capabilities, optimal natural frequencies for the spar are computed. The results show that an ability to vary the spar's natural heaving frequency is indeed beneficial, and that significant power absorption benefits can be attained at low wave frequencies using the suggested tuning mechanism to produce these frequency adjustments.

AB  - The effects of consolidation under a footing are generally viewed as beneficial due to the resulting increased capacity. Consolidation may also be actively sought because it minimizes footing embedment, which can be critical for the installation of mobile offshore jack-ups because available leg length is limited. However, it can also set the platform footing up to subsequently punch through the strengthened zone, with potentially serious consequences. The problem is complex due to the three-dimensional nature of consolidation. Further, footing penetration leaves the soil above heavily remolded and generates large excess pore pressures below, such that the soil state even prior to consolidation is significantly altered from its in situ conditions. This study has taken an experimental approach to investigate the effects of consolidation around a footing penetrating into carbonate silty clay and, following detailed discussion of the response, offers a framework to predict the changes to the load-penetration curve.

JO  - Marine Ecology Progress Series
PY  - 1995
VL  - 129
IS  - 1-3
AB  - A simple expression enables prediction of the effect of photosynthetic and calcifying systems on air-sea CO2 exchange at all spatial scales (from organism to ecosystem). Input data are: grass primary production (P-g), respiration (R), net calcification (G) and the ratio of CO2 released to CaCO3 precipitated (psi); the output is the amount of dissolved inorganic carbon (F-CO2) which needs to be exchanged with the atmosphere to balance biologically mediated changes in the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon in an open sea water system: F-CO2 = -P-g + R + psi G. Coral reef data were used in the model to illustrate the relative influence of organic and inorganic carbon metabolism on ocean-atmosphere CO2 cycling. A coral reef comprised of calcareous and non-calcareous organisms can be shown to act as a sink for atmospheric CO2 when excess (= net) production is high and CaCO3 precipitation is low. These characteristics are not typical of actively developing reef systems which typically exhibit a nearly balanced organic carbon metabolism (P-g/R approximate to 1) and relatively high rates of calcification. In these circumstances, reef communities can be expected to cause CO2 evasion to the atmosphere. This prediction is confirmed by the only existing measurement of air-sea CO2 flux in a coral reef system.

VL  - 1037
IS  - 7
AB  - One of the ancillary services the wind farms are required to provide to the system operators is reserve power, which is achieved by down-regulating the wind farm from its possible power. In order to estimate the reserves, the possible power needs to be calculated by correcting the reduced wake effects behind the down-regulated turbines. The most recent grid codes dictate the quality of the possible power at the wind farm level to be assessed within 1-min intervals for offshore wind power plants. Therefore, the necessity of a fast and reliable wake model is more prominent than ever. Here we investigate the performance of two engineering wake models with 1-sec resolution SCADA data on three different offshore wind farms, given the quantified input uncertainty. The preliminary results show that, even wind farm specific training of the model parameters might fail to comply with the strict criteria stated in the grid codes, especially for the layouts with significant wake losses. In order to tackle the inadequacy of the engineering wake models to capture some of the dynamics in the wind farm flow due to the embedded assumptions, purely data-driven techniques are evaluated. The flexibility of such an on-line model enables 'site-turbine-time-specific' modelling, in which the parameters are defined per turbine and updated with each time-step in a specific wind farm.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 13
IS  - 2, SI
AB  - Purpose Seaweed blooms are an irregular but frequent phenomenon in many coastal areas and during the touristic season, can cause limitations for recreational use of beaches. Here, we propose composting of seaweed removed from the shoreline as alternative to current management practices (e.g. disposal in landfills or incineration). Methods A co-composting strategy with garden prune waste was chosen for the treatment of seaweed blooms removed from the beaches. Composting was performed in windrows of 10 m long, 1.5 m wide and 1 m high using different ratios of algae and garden prune residues (1:2; 1:1 and 2:1) at a composting facility in Rota (Cadiz, Spain). Results Characteristic temperature profiles consisting of a very brief mesophilic phase, a 15-20-day thermophilic phase (maximum of 50-70 degrees C) and a second mesophilic phase (40-35oC) after 30-50 days were observed. After curing for more than 160 days, a stabilized non-phytotoxic composted material (50-70 g kg(-1) C; 2-3 g kg(-1) N; C/N ratio of 21-27 and electrical conductivity between 1.8-2.4 mS cm(-1)) was obtained. Composting worked best using a 2:1 ratio (prune waste:algae). The composted organic material showed larger presence of stabilized lignin-derived compounds as assessed via nuclear magnetic resonance. No odors were detected during the composting process suggesting that open-air treatment is feasible. Conclusion The co-composting strategy provides a safe, local and sustainable approach to deal with seaweed blooms during peaks of recreational use and in situations where algae have to be removed.

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The optimal design and preliminary strength assessment of offshore wind support structures gains growing interest given the potential to drive the costs further down. This study develops a framework for Fatigue Limit State (FLS) estimations of monopiles in a simple and quick manner so as to address site variations in an offshore wind farm (OWF). Additionally, it serves the need for optimisation of all structures in the farm in the early design phase. The framework consists of two elements: (i) a stand-alone model that predicts in a simplified way the damage caused by the varying loading and (ii) correction factors that increase its accuracy. The concept of the model relies on the analytical approximation of the dynamic response, thus by-passing time consuming numerical processes. The above step renders it a simplified version of the conventional frequency-domain. Its benchmarking against the time-domain aeroelastic code DNV-GL Bladed shows fair accuracy but also certain systematic errors. These are tackled by correction factors that are generated at a reference wind turbine, where time-domain detailed assessment is necessary. Once calculated, they are transferred to the positions of interest in the farm. The method works well for lower parts of the support structure, making it suitable for monopile analysis and design.

AB  - The importance of this study is to underline the fact that the wind energy potential in the western part of the Black Sea basin can be considered significant, while the wave energy is lower in comparison with oceans. However, in winter time when energy consumption in Bulgaria and Romania is high, the wave energy presents the highest values. The aim of this research paper is to draw a comprehensive picture regarding the wave and wind energy near Bulgaria and Romania coastlines. More precisely, six locations were studied. Regarding the geographical location, the studied points are located in the range 42Â°N to 45.2Â°N and 27Â°E to 30Â°E as follows: three points are near to the Bulgariaâ€™s coastline and the other three close to Romaniaâ€™s coastline. In this study, the wind conditions were analyzed at 10-meter height. The data for the wind analysis were provided by the Regional Climate Model (RCM) from Euro-Cordex database (EUR-11) and covers three intervals. All intervals cover 30-year of data as follows: Historical dataset (01 January 1976 to 31 December 2005), near future RCP8.5 scenario (01 January 2021 to 31 December 2050) and future RCP8.5 scenario (01 January 2071 to 31 December 2100). The wave analysis was conducted on the same intervals but using data coming from SWAN model. Finally, by analyzing the resulted coming from this joint evaluation it can be concluded that the presented analysis provides a more comprehensive picture regarding the future wind and wave energy resources in the coastal environment of Bulgaria and Romania, compared with historical period.

AB  - Energy harvested from a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) varies greatly with the location of its installation. Determining an optimal location that can result in maximum output power is therefore critical. In this paper, we present a novel approach to predicting the output power of a nearshore WEC by characterizing ocean waves using floating buoys. We monitored the movement of the buoys using an Arduino-based data collection module, including a gyro-accelerometer sensor and a wireless transceiver. The collected data were utilized to train and test prediction models. The models were developed using machine learning algorithms: SVM, RF and ANN. The results of the experiments showed that measurements from the data collection module can yield a reliable predictor of output power. Furthermore, we found that the predictors work better when the regressors are combined with a classifier. The accuracy of the proposed prediction model suggests that it could be extremely useful in both locating optimal placement for wave energy harvesting plants and designing the shape of the buoys used by them.

AB  - We investigated a possible reduction in CO, uptake rate by phototrophic red tide dinoflagellates arising from mixotrophy. We measured the daily ingestion rates of Prorocentrum minimum by Prorocentrum micans over 5 days in 10 L experimental bottles, and the uptake rates of total dissolved inorganic carbon (C-T) by a mixture of B micans and B minimum (mixotrophic growth), and for the predator B micans (phototrophic growth; control) and prey B minimum (phototrophic growth; control) alone. To account for the effect of pH on the phototrophic growth rates of B micans and P minimum, measurements of C-T and pH in the predator and prey control bottles were continued until the pH reached the same level (pH 9.5) as that in the experimental bottles on the final day of incubation. The measured total C-T uptake rate by the mixture of B micans and B minimum changed from 123 to 161 mu mol C-T kg(-1) d(-1) over the course of the experiment, and was lower than the C-T uptake rates shown by P. micans and B minimum in the predator and prey control bottles, respectively, which changed from 132 to 176 mol C-T kg(-1) d(-1) over the course of the experiment. The reduction in total C-T uptake rate arising from the mixotrophy of B micans was 7-31\% of the daily C-T uptake rate seen during photosynthesis. The results suggest that red tide dinoflagellates take up less C-T during mixotrophy.

AB  - Ocean acidification has led to detectable changes in seawater chemistry around the world, which are associated with reduced growth and survival of many species. Acute ocean acidification ``events{''} in the Pacific Northwest United States have jeopardized the \$270 million, 3200 jobs/year shellfish aquaculture industry in Washington State, and this has contributed to the state's broad-based, legislatively driven response to ocean acidification. Even though impacts from ocean acidification have yet to be felt in many locations, states, and regions are beginning to take action on the issue. In this paper, we present an array of actions that can be undertaken by communities or regions to address ocean acidification. The actions can be coupled, completed one at a time, or aligned with other environmental initiatives, and they can be tailored to the prevailing political or economic environment. We review which actions have been used by different U.S. states and identify common themes and popular choices. We close by suggesting combinations of conditions and clusters of activities that seem to promote rapid and sustained action. Cutting atmospheric carbon dioxide levels internationally is still the most comprehensive way to address ocean acidification, but this review shows that productive actions can still be taken at smaller scales to help marine resource-dependent communities adapt to existing ocean acidification and prepare for possible future impacts

TI  - The effects of mean wind speed uncertainty on project finance debt sizing for offshore wind farms
JO  - Applied Energy
PY  - 2019
VL  - 252
IS  - NA
AB  - Financing costs for offshore projects depend, among many other variables, on the quality of mean wind speed predictions. Financial institutions determine the amount of debt that can be reasonably supported by the project, based on probabilistic cash flow metrics derived from estimated mean wind speeds. Within the offshore wind industry, it is widely believed that longer wind resource campaigns or more precise wind measurement devices that decrease mean wind speed uncertainty lead to lower LCOE values. This paper shows that this is not always true, while a decrease in mean wind speed uncertainty may result in better financing conditions, it typically requires higher development expenditure. We build a theoretical cost modelling framework, which includes detailed project financing constraints, and then apply this to an industrial case study to analyse project financing of different types of offshore wind farms. We show that developers need to find the right balance between a decrease in financing costs and an increase in development expenditure. For projects limited by the maximum gearing or with an unfavourable trade-off between the development expenditure and the increased P90 annual energy production, more precise resource estimation can result in higher LCOE values. This paper suggests a new way of understanding the effects of wind resource assessment campaigns by integrating project finance constraints into cost calculations and highlighting the importance of detailed cost modelling for optimal design of offshore wind farms.

AB  - The C sequestration in coastal blue carbon (C-b) ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes, was discovered to be useful in mitigating the increasing trend of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission due to climate change. In this study, we systematically estimate traditional C-b ecosystem distribution and the associated C-b sequestration rate, and then further quantify the C-b sinks fishery contribution to C-b ecosystem due to human activity in coastal ecosystem. The results show that the global C-b ecosystem is able to store 10.8 PgC, wherein biomass and soil are able to store 2.13 and 8.68 PgC, respectively. In China, the C-b pools are 162 TgC in mangroves, 67 TgC in saltmarshes and 75 TgC in seagrass. The human activity induced global C-b sink fishery on C-b ecosystem is about 26.58-37.6 TgC yr(-1), accounting for 30.7\%-43.4\% of the world's traditional C-b sequestration ecosystem. The global C-b sequestration potential reaches up to 86.59 Tg yr(-1), while China can explain 1.70\% of the world's total C-b sequestration. However, in China, the C-b sequestration due to human activity reaches up to 632-7.89 TgC yr(-1), accounting for 20.9\%-23.7\% of global C-b sink fishery. Therefore, it is very important to build the C-b sink fisheries measure and monitor system to scientifically valuate C-b sink fisheries and associated development potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Water-air carbon fluxes in the coastal upwelling zone off northern Baja California
JO  - Ciencias Marinas
PY  - 2015
VL  - 41
IS  - 2
AB  - An important challenge in marine science is to quantify the air sea flux of carbon because of its possible relation to climate change and the decreasing pH in seawater. In coastal areas of Mexico, the magnitude and variability of carbon fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere is almost completely unknown. Therefore, the objective of this research was to determine the variability of air-sea carbon fluxes in the upwelling system off northern Baja California. A one-year time series of carbon fluxes was generated from data on partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) from an oceanographic buoy installed immediately south of Punta Banda (Ensenada, Baja California), which measured salinity, temperature, and pCO(2) in the water (pCO(2water)) and air (pCO(2air)) every 3 h during 2009. The study area presented several upwelling events with low sea surface temperatures (<= 14 degrees C), salinity <34.0, and high values of pCO(2),a, which resulted in an export of excess CO2 in the water to the atmosphere, identifying the area as a temporary source of CO2. In contrast, during the relaxation of upwelling, low values of PCO2water and intermediate surface temperatures resulted in the sea acting as a sink for CO2. The average daily flux was 0.6 0.11 mmol C m(-2) in winter, 2.8 +/- 0.27 mmol C m(-2) in spring, 0.3 +/- 0.11 mmol C m(-2) in summer, and -0.3 +/- 0.03 mmol C. m(-2) in autumn, the positive sign indicating fluxes from the water to the air and vice versa. The annual balance of CO2 fluxes was 0.3 +/- 0.06 mol C m(-2) yr(-1); thus, the system turned out to be a net source of CO2 from the ocean to the atmosphere.

AB  - The maritime industry, among all other industries, is being forced to gradually reduce its emissions. Legislation is one of the tools applying this pressure, and from 1 January 2020, it focuses on the reduction of sulfur percentage in the heavy fuel oil (HFO)-powered vessels to 0.5\%. In the beginning of this paper, the harmful environmental contribution of the naval sector is presented, along with the current legislation. The maritime industry is in a transitional stage, diverging from fossil fuels through alternative technologies and fuels, aiming to become over the long term a zero-emission industry. However, there are many implemented technologies, mostly of a mechanical nature, that already improve the efficiency of vessels and indirectly reduce their emissions. Such technologies include shaft generators (SGs), scrubbers, etc. The aim is for alternative fuels and technologies such as solar and wind to be implemented, too. Such technologies, when combined with the advantages of digitalization and automation, can further reduce emissions toward zero-emission vessels (ZEVs) through integrated systems. The present paper serves the purpose of a common point of gathering, addressing, and explaining the latest updates, previous achievements, and future targets of the maritime sector. The very nature of the subject-electric propulsion in the maritime sector-makes it very difficult to find sufficient and trustworthy data. There are two main reasons for this problem. The first one is that electric vehicles became commercial at a large scale (electric cars) very recently, and are still in a transitional stage. The second reason is that the maritime industry is very competitive; therefore, state-of-the-art technologies and data that give each company the lead are rarely published, and when they do, it happens very discreetly. In the quantitative part of the paper, where the photovoltaic (PV) and battery system calculations take place, there is no use of a specific model rather than a simplified approach. The purpose of the calculations is to show that with the present technologies, a purely solar-powered commercial vessel (such as RoRo, passenger, etc.) is technically impossible, and that there could be only a small contribution-of around 7\%-to the electricity needs of a roll-on/roll-off (RoRo)-passenger ship. The state of the art finds a very short number of vessels that already use battery propulsion, but is expected to increase in the upcoming years. The present paper not only presents an overview of the state-of-the-art achievements in the electric propulsion of vessels, it also considers the exploitation of the continuous growth that the battery market is facing. As stated before, batteries are on the up, and this is due to the emerging need for energy storage in electricity grids that depend increasingly on renewable energy sources (RES). The paper makes a first consideration about the feasibility and possible benefits of implementing grid-like battery systems on-board vessels. In such a scenario, vessels would acquire significantly bigger energy capacity, allowing greater travel distances, a possible contribution of 44\% of the vessel's total power requirements (propulsion included), and a surplus as far as electricity requirements are concerned. There is also the more futuristic long-term scenario where Green Ports would charge vessels purely from RES dedicated to the port's needs. The last part of the paper contains a qualitative assessment about the possible impacts that a battery-powered maritime industry could have.

AB  - Foreship has helped to determine the benefits and limitations of batteries, or energy storage systems (ESS). Batteries and marine fuel cells have shown promise on smaller vessels but the flexible approach needed to use these technologies as a power source for larger, oceangoing is only now beginning to emerge. In comparison to the baseline, powering the ship with an ESS is moderately cheaper and reduces yearly CO2 emissions by 9.6%. Fuel cell technology using H2 from renewable sources cuts emissions entirely but costs around four times more than the baseline. When the H2 for the fuel cells is produced with natural gas, yearly cost comes down by almost half compared to when sustainably sourced hydrogen is used, emissions are greater, but still 25% lower than the baseline. In an investigation, if all 283 merchant ships below 3500 gt were to install ESS, a total of 164,239 ton of CO2 would be saved.

AB  - Mangrove ecosystem plays important role as carbon sink, not only on mangrove community but also on the top soil. The purposes of this research were 1) to estimates and compare C-stocks in vegetation and non-vegetation mangrove soils (represented by aquaculture ponds and mudflats); 2) modeling the spatial distribution of soil C-stocks in the study area. The purposive sampling method was used to determine 16 sample plots representing vegetation and non-vegetation mangroves. In each plot, the soil samples were taken on top soil layer (0-10 cm). For general display of spatial distribution maps of soil C-stocks, spatial interpolation is used by the Ordinary Kriging method. The result showed that total of soil C-stocks in coastal area of Trimulyo was 148.53 MgC ha(-1), with composition of 53.59\% in mangrove vegetation, 38.82\% and 7.57\% in cultivation pond and mudflat, respectively. Statistical analysis with ANOVA test showed no significant difference (p = 0.972) between soil C stock in vegetation and non-vegetation mangrove. It shows that the water column on the coast of Trimulyo has great potential as a carbon store.

AB  - Zero-emission ships (ZE-ships) concept has been introduced as a promising solution in reducing the greenhouse gases (GHG) emission in marine shipping industry. Among different solutions, Fuel cells (FCs) are introduced as one of the most efficient technologies for providing the propulsion force of the ZE-ships. Energy storage systems (ESSs) are also used as auxiliary resource to cover the fast dynamics of the loads the the FCs are not able to supply. Design and operation problem of ZE-ships has been investigated in the literature from different viewpoints. This paper provides a survey on available studies in the field of cost effective energy management of FC/ESS based ZE-ships. To this end, first, different studies in the literature are categorized from the viewpoint of energy management strategies (EMSs) and discussed Then other categories of the works such as auxiliary energy resources, problem objectives, and simulation methods are also provided.

AB  - The environmental restrictions set by International Maritime Organization Marine Pollution -Annex VI on heavy fuel sulfur (SOx) content in international shipping emissions are already in application. No more than 0.10% of sulfur content in ship exhaust gas is allowed in Sulfur Emission Control Areas, including the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, North America (including most of US and Canadian Coast), and the US Caribbean ECA. To respect environmental restrictions, especially SOx emissions limits, ship owners and operators can still use heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil as bunker fuels as long as the NOx/SOx emissions are limited by using adequate technologies. Another option which fulfills emission regulations is the LNG as a bunker fuel. The use of LNG as a ship fuel offers many advantages mostly the emission regulation respect. LNG is the only fuel that can meet current and future requirements for the major types of emissions. The pollutants reduction depends on the technology used in engines.

AB  - The waste heat recovery from marine diesel engines is important in terms of improving the energy efficiency of ships. Thermo-electric generator can be used to convert the waste heat in the ship to the electrical energy. This study investigates the effects of different thermo-electric materials and sea water temperatures on the thermal performance of the thermo-electric power generation system. The polyacetylene, Ba8Ga16Ge30, SiGe and (CuI)001Bi2Te3 are considered thermo-electric materials. The energy of the exhaust gases from the marine diesel engine on a handymax-size tanker is used as the waste heat source. The maximum electrical power of 117 kW is produced for (CuI)0.01Bi2Te3 at the sea water temperature of 5Â°C and the engine load of 100% MCR (Maximum Continuous Rating). However, the minimum electrical power of 18.74 kW is produced for the polyacetylene at 30Â°C and 75% MCR. Â© 2023 the Author(s).

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Climate change is always a concern in the shipping sector, and there is a constant effort in the international shipping community to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The public transportation and commercial vehicle sectors have already begun implementing electric vehicles to meet the emission reduction requirements that are being put in place around the world. It is time that the commercial shipping sector joined them by working towards the electrification of ships and possibly using large batteries as fuel. However, there are some concerns with the ability to charge batteries during long voyages and the weight addition that large batteries would bring. One way to reduce GHG emissions in port is by cold ironing a ship or plugging in a ship to an onshore power source instead of using onboard diesel generators when ships are at port. This is effective because the main propulsion does not need power while in port. However, to ensure that the integrity of the onshore grid is not affected by this additional heavy load that may arise from the loads onboard the vessel, these loads must be analyzed before connecting them to the onshore grid. In this paper, to address these issues, this paper aims to investigate the power quality of the distribution side of TN General Rudder, a Texas A\&M University Galveston's owned ship. Based on the distribution system's harmonics content and power quality, the authors propose an active filter on the secondary side to reduce the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). The proposed filter results in a decrease of 90\% total harmonic distortion, leading to increased efficiency and system performance. Further, the impact of load on the onboard diesel generator and the onshore electrical grid is also examined.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThis study aims to simultaneously reduce biogas slurry nutrient and upgrade biogas via microalgal production. Marine microalgae were grown in a culture medium containing a mixture of seawater and biogas slurry with CO2 from synthetic biogas. The effects of different ratios of biogas slurry and various influent concentrations of CH4 in synthetic biogas on the growth of Nannochloropsis sp. were examined. Nutrient removal and biogas upgrading were also studied under different influent CH4 concentrations. RESULTSNannochloropsis sp. showed optimal growth in 40\% biogas slurry and significantly enhanced growth in synthetic biogas with 50\% CO2. The optimal range of influent CH4 concentration for the removal of biogas slurry nutrients was 45\% to 50\%. Notably, the influent CH4 concentration of 60\% (v/v) provided an optimal CO2 concentration for Nannochloropsis sp. cultivation. Advantageous CO2 removal and biogas upgrading were observed under this condition. This treatment increased CH4 concentration in synthetic biogas from 60\% to 93.58\% after 6 days cultivation. CONCLUSIONAppropriate control of the biogas slurry or seawater and CH4 concentrations in the influent is crucial to simultaneously optimize nutrient removal and biogas upgrading.

JO  - Current Science

VL  - 116
IS  - 6
AB  - Increasing soil carbon stocks and protecting carbon-rich soils are crucial for achieving the Paris climate targets. Mangrove forests are the potential carbon sinks for mitigating the growing greenhouse gas emissions due to their highest carbon storage capacity per unit area compared to terrestrial forests. Furthermore, restricted global distribution of mangroves testifies their role in climate change mitigation as most effective at the national level rather than on a global scale. Nevertheless, lack of reliable estimates, insufficient data, discrepancy in the available data, increasing degradation rates and failure of conservation endeavours signify that we are missing the carbon storage potential of mangrove soil. So, here we emphasize the imperative need of country-wise site-specific precise estimates and an understanding of the spatial distribution of mangrove soil carbon stocks to recognize the actual climate mitigation potential of the mangroves as well as strengthen the conservation measures for the sustainability of mangroves.

AB  - Wind energy turbines and offshore hydrocarbon platforms rely on injected concrete grout to support and transfer loads between steel substructures. Deterioration of this grout under large operational stresses can lead to a loss of bonding, the formation of gaps, crushing and the loss of grout from the annulus between the steel substructures. In this paper, the integrity of the grout between two steel panels is experimentally tested using a low-frequency ultrasound backscatter method[1]. The experimental results and modelled outcomes[1] are compared for grout condition classes, including: good condition, gaps between the grout and either steel panel and the complete absence of grout. Pearson correlation coefficients of over 83% are observed when comparing the notch magnitudes and the frequencies on the modelled and experimental reflectance spectra of the front and rear gap, as well as missing grout conditions. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) similarity tests on the modelled and experimental notch magnitudes indicate a 20% significance on the rear gap and front gap spectra and a 10% significance on the missing grout spectra. The significance of these tests supports the potential application of backscattered low-frequency ultrasound for grout condition inspection. However, development of automated condition recognition algorithms, based on either spectral characteristics or time-localised spectral features of the backscatter, is required to make routine inspection commercially viable.

PY  - NA
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Warming temperatures and elevated CO2 are inextricably linked global change phenomena, but they are rarely manipulated together in field experiments. As a result, ecosystem-level responses to these interacting facets of global change remain poorly understood. Here we report on a four-year field manipulation of warming and elevated CO2 in a coastal wetland. Contrary to our expectations, elevated CO2 combined with warming reduced the rate of carbon accumulation due to increases in plant-mediated oxygen flux that stimulated aerobic decomposition via oxygen priming. Evidence supporting this interpretation includes an increase in soil redox potential and a decrease in the nominal oxidation state of the dissolved organic carbon pool. While warming alone stimulated methane (CH4) emissions, we found that elevated CO2 combined with warming reduced net CH4 flux due to plant-microbe feedbacks. Together, these results demonstrate that ecosystem responses to interacting facets of global change are mediated by plant traits that regulate the redox state of the soil environment. Thus, plant responses are critical for predicting future ecosystem survival and climate feedbacks.

AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of renewable and especially tidal energy through a political, economic, social, technology, legal and environmental (PESTLE) analysis approach and by reviewing the most up to date relevant literature. The study focuses on the United Kingdom given the favourable environmental resources for such technologies; the number of different design concepts that are currently under development as well as the research funding that has been invested over the last few years. Findings of the analysis identify the risks and multiple stakeholders involved at all stages of the tidal energy projects development from the conceptualization of the design, right through to decommissioning. Many of the stakeholders present benefits to the tidal developers through funding, incentives and knowledge sharing, but at the same time they also present potential risks to the future of projects. This is mostly down to different approaches of the most important aspect of tidal energy that needs to be considered, making it hard for technologists and developers to equally address all requirements. From this research it can be concluded that several of these risks can be mitigated early on providing that particular stakeholders are involved at the correct stage of a project.

TI  - Adaptive Power Management of Hierarchical Controlled Hyrid Shipboard Microgrids
JO  - Ieee Access
PY  - 2022
VL  - 10
IS  - NA
AB  - Shipboard microgrids (SMGs) are distinguished by the heavy propulsion system that can vary largely in a short time. Consequently, this variation shifts the optimum operating points of the diesel engines that leads to increase the overall emissions and operational costs. Moreover, power fluctuations caused by the dynamic loads such as propulsion motors along with the lack of cold-ironing facilities at both ends of seaports make it even worse. Therefore, the application of energy storage systems (ESSs) with proper coordination is becoming very popular for ships to improve the energy management, and thus decreases the fuel consumption. The aim of this paper is to firstly highlights different architectures of SMGs and the benefits the ESS can brings into them, then proposes an enhanced hierarchical control-based energy management scheme that is suitable for SMGs operations during an islanded and grid-connected operation. The proposed method based on the ESSs supports the diesel generators to enable them to operate in the optimum window recommended by the diesel engines company, which significantly decreases fuel consumption, operational costs, and emissions. Furthermore, to provide a linkage between SMG and the grid during port stays, conventional P - f and Q - V droop control strategy is adopted to import and export power to the seaport load or the grid for emergency purposes referred to in this study as Ship-to-X operation. The enhanced hierarchical control is capable of optimally shifting the modes for efficient and reliable operation and reducing specific fuel consumption. The performance of the proposed scheme is adopted and validated with satisfactory results of a practical hybrid SMG in a MATLAB/SIMULINK environment.

PY  - 2018
VL  - 214

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems store large amounts of carbon in biomass and sediments. This so called â€˜blue carbonâ€™ that is captured by oceanic and coastal ecosystems plays an important role in climate change mitigation strategies. However, most biomass and carbon measurements have been conducted in coastal and delta mangroves, while oceanic mangroves are still insufficiently researched. In this paper we present results from our research on the Karimunjawa archipelago in the Java Sea north of Central Java, Indonesia, where we measured soil carbon stocks (soil total organic carbon â€“ TOC) of an oceanic mangrove ecosystem. In previous research, we had already analyzed above-ground carbon (AGC) and below-ground biomass carbon (BGBC), so that we are now able to present the total ecosystem carbon stock. We took 35 soil samples along seven transects to analyze the relationship between (a) soil TOC and distance from shoreline, (b) total ecosystem carbon stock (AGC + BGBC + soil TOC) and distance from shoreline, (c) total C of living biomass (AGC + BGBC) and distance from shoreline, as well as (d) soil TOC and living biomass. We took another nine soil samples to analyze the distribution of soil TOC in the soil profile at a greater resolution. Our results show that there is a wide range of soil carbon stocks that varies from 3.3 t C haâˆ’1 to 366.7 t C haâˆ’1. On average of the 35 samples soils contribute to 45.5% of the total ecosystem carbon stock. Overall there is no correlation between the analyzed variables. However, there is a correlation between distance from the shoreline and soil carbon stock for the longest transect and a strong relationship between soil depth and soil carbon stock for all samples. Carbon stock per increment decreases with a conspicuous drop at 15 cm. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The global marine fleets have been reported to consume approximately 300 million tons of fuel annually and contribute 2.8\% of global greenhouse gases emissions (GHG). It is widely projected that the numbers will continue to grow, predominantly driven by the increase in global trades and energy demand from emerging countries. In recent years, enabling technologies, such as hybrid electrical propulsion system and advanced power management strategies, have been developed and introduced to the marine industries not only to reduce fuel consumption, but also to adhere to the increasingly stringent regulations on emissions by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Such technologies are especially critical for vessels that operate in the water near urban areas, such as ferries and tugs, which may contribute up to 15\% of the global marine fleet fuel consumption. In this paper, the design and integration of hybrid electrical propulsion systems, with the use of modern DC distribution and energy storage systems, will be discussed and compared to conventional systems. The benefits of hybrid all-electric power and propulsion system in terms of fuel and energy consumption, emission reduction, performance, as well as system redundancy are presented in this paper.

AB  - The Marine Environment Protection Committee has introduced the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index, which will enter into force in 2023, to reduce emissions from existing ships. Since many existing ships do not comply with the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index requirements, certain mitigation measures must be applied to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In this study, an analysis of slow steaming for fulfilling these requirements is carried out using the example of containerships built until 2016 employing the analytic model. The required speed reduction for ships which do not meet the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index requirements is quantified, and the potential problems related to long-term sailing with reduced speed are highlighted. The relationship between ship speed and fuel consumption for Post Panamax, Post Panamax Plus, and Very Large Containership fleets is analysed. The obtained results highlight the significance of potential implementation issues of each mitigation measure to achieve sustainable growth of the maritime transport industry. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

Off the US coast, 60% of the offshore wind lies in deep water (greater than 60m) where the development of Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) hull technology will likely be required in lieu of fixed bottom technology such as jacket structures. The United States National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the offshore wind community commonly refer to 60m as the transition point between fixed bottom structures and floating structures due to economic reasons. Floating wind turbines deployed in the harsh offshore marine environment require the use of materials that are cost-effective, corrosion resistant, require little maintenance and are highly durable. This has led the University of Maine to develop a concrete hull technology called VolturnUS for full-scale 6MW FOWTs. In this work, experimental testing was conducted to verify the performance of the concrete under operational, serviceability, and extreme loading conditions as required by the American Bureau of Shipping Guide for Building and Classing Floating Offshore Wind Turbines. The testing included structural testing sub-components of the hull and served as experimental verification of American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) concrete design methodology which is currently approved and being used to design the first commercial scale FOWTs in the United States. Two 6MW wind turbines supported on VolturnUS concrete hulls will be used for the New England Aqua Ventus I project. The project is planned to be deployed and connected to the grid by 2019 in the Northeast U.S. and is funded by the US Department of Energy. Copyright Â© 2017 ASME.

AB  - The frequency fluctuation of the offshore wind power generation system based on MMC-HVDC will affect the normal operation of the healthy wind plants when fault occurs or in other transient conditions. In serious cases, large-scale off-grid wind turbines may take place. For this reason, we analyze the relationship between frequency and d-axis and q-axis of the AC voltage in offshore wind power system, and propose a frequency control scheme. A frequency loop is introduced into the offshore converter controller to stabilize the frequency of the bus voltage. Considering the distinctions of frequency in different locations, a scheme of frequency cooperative optimization control is proposed to further optimize the frequency fluctuation at the wind turbine collector substations. Finally, a simulation model of offshore wind power plants based on MMC-HVDC was built on the MATLAB/Simulink. The research results show that, with cooperative optimization control, the frequency fluctuation in wind power system bus voltage and wind turbine collector substations can be reduced to less than 30% of that without control in conditions of system fault and abrupt change of operation. The proposed method can be adopted to effectively suppress the frequency fluctuation of wind power generation system based on MMC-HVDC in transient conditions.

TI  - Compressor selection methods for multi-stage re-liquefaction system of liquefied CO2 transport ship for CCS
JO  - Applied Thermal Engineering
PY  - 2015
VL  - 82
IS  - NA
AB  - Recently, CCS (carbon dioxide capture and sequestration) has been receiving considerable attention as a possible means of dealing with emissions of CO2, a greenhouse gas. To this end, EOR (enhanced oil recovery) and EGR (enhanced gas recovery) are regarded as being viable options for economically sequestrating large amounts of CO2. A feasible approach would involve capturing CO2 from large-scale CO2 emission sources such as power plants, and then transporting that captured gas to near-depleted oil and gas wells to maintain the reservoir pressure and enhance the oil/gas recovery rate. In the future, CO2 will be transported large distances from emission sources in developed countries to oil/gas producing regions by pipelines or ships. The long-distance ship-based transport of CO2 would require that the gas be compressed or liquefied (LCO2). Furthermore, an LCO2 transport ship would have to be capable of processing boil-off gas while at sea. In this study, the selection method of compressors for re-liquefaction system of dedicated LCO2 transport ship was investigated by computational method. The performance of same compression ratio (SCR) method exhibited low levels of efficiency and reliability as for coefficient of performance (COP) and compressor discharge temperature in terms of oil degradation compared to that of intermediate pressure optimization (IPO). Of these three methods, IPO produced the highest level of performance of all, but could not guarantee compressor reliability as like SCR, too. Intermediate pressure optimization with same discharge temperature (IPODT) method was found to be better in terms of reliability, with a decrease in performance of only 5\% relative to that obtained by IPO. Consequently, we recommend the use of the IPODT method for the design of a multi-stage compression system for the re-liquefaction cycle of an LCO2 transport ship. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An optimal day-ahead operation of a microgrid based on coastal energy hub is presented in this paper. The proposed CEH included wind turbine, photovoltaic unit, combined cooling, heat and power, and seawater desalination. The purpose of the optimization is minimization of the operational and environmental costs considering several technical limitations. The CEH includes an ice storage conditioner together with an energy storage system, i.e. thermal energy storage system. Particularly, the impacts of an innovative rechargeable and emerging ESS that is solar-powered compressed air energy storage is scrutinized, on the efficiency and operational and pollution costs of the CEH. It is clear that there is an intrinsic deviation between predicted and actual uncertainty variables in MG. This paper presents a bi-level stochastic optimal operation model based on risk averse strategy of information gap decision theory to overcome this information gap and to help Microgrid operator. To reduce the complexity of the proposed model, Karush-Kuhn-Tucker method is used for converting the bi-level problem into a single level. The Augmented Epsilon Constraint method is used to deals with multi objective optimization problem to harvest the maximum horizon of the uncertainties of the parameters. The proposed model implemented the Time of Use program as a price-based demand response program. Finally, the efficacy of the SPCAES for minimizing the operational cost and pollutions in the dayahead operation is depicted by implementation of the presented model on the typical CEH.

AB  - The maritime industry is experiencing a technological revolution that affects shipbuilding, operation of both seagoing and inland vessels, cargo management, and working practices in harbors. This ongoing transformation is driven by the ambition to make the ecosystem more sustainable and cost-efficient. Digitalization and automation help achieve these goals by transforming shipping and cruising into a much more cost- and energy-efficient and decarbonized industry segment. The key enablers in these processes are always-available connectivity and content delivery services, which can not only aid shipping companies in improving their operational efficiency and reducing carbon emissions, but also contribute to enhanced crew welfare and passenger experience. Due to recent advancements in integrating high-capacity and ultra-reliable terrestrial and non-terrestrial networking technologies, ubiquitous maritime connectivity is becoming a reality. To cope with the increased complexity of managing these integrated systems, this article advocates the use of artificial intelligence and machine-learning-based approaches to meet the service requirements and energy efficiency targets in various maritime communications scenarios.

AB  - The worldwide environmental concern and awareness created a way towards the generation of pollution-free wind and solar renewable energies. Wind and Photovoltaic (PV) power plants of each 10 MW capacity located in the Shagaya area, west of Kuwait, were compared after one year of operation. The wind power plants recorded high capacity factors resulting in a yearly power production of 42.59 GWh, 21% higher than expected (contractual 31.160 GWh). It will reduce the emission of CO2 throughout the projected lifetime of 25 years by 118,303 tons. CAPEX (capital Expenditure) and OPEX (operation expenditure) were taken into consideration throughout the life of the plants along with investment costs resulting in a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for wind of 0.015 KWD/kWh or 0.046 USD/kWh, compared to 0.027 KWD/kWh or 0.082 USD/kWh for solar PV (44% lower than PV). Offshore, Boubyan Island, Northern Kuwait territorial waters, were found to be the foremost appropriate for wind energy generation, with Wind Power Density of more than 500 Watt/m2 in summer which is ideal for the high energy demanding season in Kuwait. The LCOE for offshore wind energy was 27.6 fils/kWh, compared to 39.3 fils/kWh for thermal power plants. Â© 2021 EDP Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) conducted an in situ CO2 storage experiment at the 3627 meters deep ocean floor in the Monterey Canyon in 1998 and observed the phenomenon that liquid CO2 once a beaker on the ocean floor is half-filled intermittently overflows. The SRI conducted several land-based experiments in 1999 to confirm this newly observed phenomenon that could be expected to have a large influence on the feasibility assessment of storage type CO2 sequestration in the ocean. These experiments identified the key factor causing such intermittent overflow. A channel penetrating liquid CO2 in the beaker supplies enough water molecules to cause rapid hydrate growth which can displaces up wards the overlying liquid CO2. A mechanistic model to explain this rapid hydrate growth was proposed. On the other hand, in the absence of any water channels a mass of liquid CO2 covered with hydrate membrane was observed to survive in a beaker for longer than 100 days. In the real CO2 storage site, the water channels formed between large CO2 droplets will be crushed up by the head pressure due to the density difference between liquid CO2 and seawater.

AB  - As world trade grows, fuel prices increase, and International Maritime Organization (IMO) emissions requirements tighten, there is more demand for the marine industry to employ innovative means of reducing the fuel consumption and emissions of shipping vessels. The main engines of large shipping vessels produce a large quantity of low temperature heat, but this valuable heat energy is transferred to cooling systems and rejected to the oceans as waste. At the same time, the electrical needs of shipping vessels are sustained by burning diesel fuel to run generators. Calnetix Technologies, in partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, has developed the Hydrocurrentâ„¢ 125EJW Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), a modularized system capable of absorbing the waste heat of main engine jacket water and converting it into grid-quality electric power. By combining this renewable source with the existing non-renewable source (engine gensets) a unique renewable-non-renewable hybrid power system is realized with minimal changes to overall ship power train. This novel hybrid system can be applied to all new and existing ships and allow for further integration into ship systems with available waste heat. Shipping vessels such as tankers, bulk carriers, and container vessels are typically equipped with a category 3 marine diesel engine for main propulsion. A 30 MW engine, a most common engine size, utilizes 200-300 m3/hr of jacket water regulated to a heated temperature of 80-95 C. When integrated into the jacket water and sea water loops, the ORC can produce up to 125 kW of gross grid-quality electric power. This adds an immense benefit to the ship. To produce the same amount of power, a diesel generator consumes as much as 250 metric tons of diesel fuel per year, generates emissions, and requires significant maintenance. Calnetix Technologies has leveraged its core technologies to develop the ORC into a reliable, high efficiency, compact and modular design. The turbo-generator or Integrated Power Module (IPM) is a hermetically sealed, high speed radial turbine coupled to a permanent magnet generator supported by magnetic bearings. Power from the IPM is converted by a high efficiency power converter supplying the ship with reliable power. The integrated design of the ORC along with the sophistication of its controls systems ensures essential ship functions are undisturbed under all conditions. The ORC is designed to comply with Nippon Kaiji Kyokai and Lloyd's Register marine regulations and sea trials are anticipated to take place in 2015. Copyright Â© 2015 by ASME.

TI  - Wetland microtopography alters response of potential net CO2 and CH4 production to temperature and moisture: Evidence from a laboratory experiment
JO  - Geoderma
PY  - 2021
VL  - 402
IS  - NA
AB  - Coastal wetlands store significant amounts of carbon (C) belowground, which may be altered through effects of rising temperature and changing hydrology on CO2 and CH4 fluxes and related microbial activities. Wetland microtopography (hummock-hollow) also plays a critical role in mediating plant growth, microbial activity, and thus cycling of C and nutrients and may interact with rising seas to influence coastal wetland C dynamics. Recent evidence suggests that CH4 production in oxygenated surface soils of freshwater wetlands may contribute substantially to global CH4 production, but comprehensive studies linking potential CH4 production to environmental and microbial variables in temperate freshwater forested wetlands are lacking. This study investigated effects of temperature, moisture, and microtopography on potential net CO2 and CH4 production and extracellular enzyme activity (beta-glucosidase, xylosidase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase) in peat soils collected from a freshwater forested wetland in coastal North Carolina, USA. Soils were retrieved from three microsites (hummock, hollow, and subsurface peat soils (approximately 20-40 cm below surface)) and incubated at two temperatures (27 degrees C and 32 degrees C) and soil water contents (65\% and 100\% water holding capacity (WHC)). Hummocks had the highest cumulative potential net CO2 (13.7 +/- 0.90 mg CO2-C g soil(-1)) and CH4 (1.8 +/- 0.42 mg CH4-C g soil(-1)) production and enzyme activity, followed by hollows (8.7 +/- 0.91 mg CO2-C g soil(-1) and 0.5 +/- 0.12 mg CH4-C g soil(-1)) and then subsurface soils (5.7 +/- 0.70 mg CO2-C g soil(-1) and 0.04 +/- 0.019 mg CH4-C g soil(-1)). Fully saturated soils had lower potential net CO2 production (50-80\%) and substantially higher potential net CH4 production compared to non-saturated soils (those incubated at 65\% WHC). Soils incubated at 32 degrees C increased potential net CO2 (24-34\%) and CH4 (56-404\%) production under both soil moisture levels compared to those incubated at 27 degrees C. The Q(10) values for potential net CO2 and CH4 production ranged from 1.5 to 2.3 and 3.3-8.8, respectively, and did not differ between any microsites or soil water content. Enrichment of delta(CO2)-C-13-C was found in saturated soils from all microsites (-24.4 to - 29.7 parts per thousand) compared to non-saturated soils (-31.1 to - 32.4 parts per thousand), while delta(CH4)-C-13-C ranged from -62 to -55 parts per thousand in saturated soils. Together, the CO2 and CH4 delta C-13 data suggest that acetoclastic methanogenesis is an important pathway for CH4 production in these wetlands. A positive relationship (Adj. R-2 = 0.40) between peroxidase activity and CH(4 )production was also found, indicating that peroxidase activity may be important in providing fermented C substrates to acetoclastic methanogenic communities and contribute to anaerobic C mineralization. These results suggest that changes in temperature and hydrology could stimulate CO2 and CH4 emissions from surface hummock soils, and to a lesser extent from hollow soils, and provide preliminary evidence that hummocks may be a spatially important and unrecognized hotspot for CH4 production.

AB  - The velocity of tidal current at the location of Haya Strait shows that the velocity of ocean currents could reach 2.54 m/s with the available power density of Pd = (0 -3670) x10-3 kW/m2. To utilise the available energy, then a prototype of bulb propeller tidal turbine in the form of Venturi canal was designed and tested using a raft platform. The dimensions of the turbine; inlet diameter D0 = 4 meter and impeller diameter D1 = 1.5 meter and outlet diameter = 2.60 meter. At the speed stated above, hydraulic force obtained reached 324 kW. Optimization of turbine output parameters is carried out through structural modification and cross-view geometrical modification. Turbine meridian cross view section is modified to be streamlined. In this case, cross view modification by adapting ducted-turbine that is carried out without changing the inlet dimension. Flow velocity was measured at three turbine sections, namely at the inlet section, the impeller housing section and the outlet section. Rate of meridian flow is measured at three meridian positions, which are Vo at the inlet, V1 at the impeller and V2 at the outlet. Output parameters are calculated based on the water velocity and the data measured at the three corresponding sections. The maximum power coefficient was found to be 0.593 that occurs at the induction factor value of a = 0.346 and the maximum thrust coefficient of CT = 1 was found at the induction factor value of a = 1. The hydraulic power is changed from 0.00 Ã· 226 kW to 0 Ã· 324 kW, or an increase of 43%. The turbine brake power is changed within the range of 0.00 Ã· 194 kW to 0 Ã· 221 kW that is equivalent to 14% of power increase. Â© 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Coastal salt marshes have been significantly suffering degradation worldwide, turning these wetlands from carbon sink to carbon source. The additions of carbon-rich substrates in degraded coastal wetlands have been documented to alleviate this situation; however, the microbial responses as well as their carbon metabolisms to the input are not well explored. Here, we investigated the effects of different addition levels (0.1\%, 1\%, and 3\%) of reed straw and biochar addition on microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) and predicted functions of carbon metabolism in degraded coastal salt marshes. The effects of the carbon-rich substrates on microbial communities are more pronounced under 3\% of reed straw and biochar than other levels, straw increased opportunistic bacteria (e.g., Bacillus and Cellvibrionaceae) and biochar increased low carbon turnover bacteria (e. g., Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria). The addition of higher doses of reed straw and biochar promoted the carbon metabolism of soil bacteria as predicted by the PICRUSt 2. Interestingly, the addition of reed straw increased the abundance involved in fungal carbon metabolism, but this was not the case for the biochar input. The addition of reed straw and biochar promoted the growth of some bacteria (e.g., Rhizobiales and Bacillus) that are beneficial to plant growth, and decreased some fungal pathogen (e.g., Magnaporthaceae and Phaeosphaeria). Our findings revealed that the carbon-rich substrates addition can reshape the microbial structure and shift their carbon metabolisms, specially, biochar has a higher potential to improve the ecosystem services, such as blue carbon sequestration, of these degraded coastal salt marshes.

AB  - The shipping industry has paid unprecedented attention to reducing emissions and pollution in recent years. In particular, the International Maritime Organization has enacted many regulations on ship emissions, and the industry has increasingly focused on the development and application of low-carbon marine fuels. The use of low carbon alternative fuels can effectively solve the current environmental and energy problems. At present, the alternative fuels available for ships include liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol, biodiesel, hydrogen and ammonia, etc. In the short term, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol technology is more mature, which can be applied to ships. In the long term, biodiesel, hydrogen fuel and ammonia fuel will inevitably become the mainstream of alternative fuels for ships. However, there are some challenges in the use of alternative fuels, such as leakage of liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas, low calorific value of methanol and biodiesel, and difficult storage of hydrogen and ammonia. This work will summarize and analyze the utilization potentiality of low carbon alternative fuel, low carbon combustion technologies for ships, and some of the new clean power technologies, which has important guiding significance for the development of low carbon fuel for ships in the future.

AB  - Maritime transport represents a considerable source of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions, with negative impact on environment and climate change. As a technical measure to quantify and reduce CO2 emissions from ships, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has introduced Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI). After a brief overview of the issues related to shipping GHG emissions, the paper presents an assessment of propulsion performances for different type of merchant ships, taking into considerations EEDI requirements. Alternative combinations between diesel engines and optimal efficiency propellers have been analysed. For every ship type, size and speed, different diesel engines have been selected and propellers have been redesigned to absorb delivered power and to give maximum efficiency at the required speed. For every study case, an attained EEDI has been computed and compared with required IMO EEDI. The impact of two parameters from EEDI formula: power and speed has been assessed to find solutions for EEDI reduction.

TI  - Membrane biological reactor treatment of a saline backwash flow from a recirculating aquaculture system
JO  - Aquacultural Engineering
PY  - 2007
VL  - 36
IS  - 2
AB  - A recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) can minimize water use, allowing fish production in regions where water is scarce and also placing the waterborne wastes into a concentrated and relatively small volume of effluent. The RAS effluent generated during clarifier backwash is usually small in volume (possibly 0.2-0.5\% of the total recirculating flow when microscreen filters are used) but contains high levels of concentrated organic solids and nutrients. When a RAS is operated at high salinities for culture of marine species, recovering the saltwater contained in the backwash effluent could allow for its reuse within the RAS and also reduce salt discharge to the environment. Membrane biological reactors (MBRs) combine activated sludge type treatment with membrane filtration. Therefore, in addition to removing biodegradable organics, suspended solids, and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, MBRs retain high concentrations of microorganisms and, when operated with membrane pore sizes < 1 mu m, exclude microorganisms from their discharge. In this research, an Enviroquip (Austin, TX) MBR pilot-plant was installed and evaluated over a range of salinities to determine its effectiveness at removing bacteria, turbidity, suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus and cBOD(5) content from the approximately 22 m(3)/day concentrated biosolids backwash flow discharged from the RASs at The Conservation Fund Freshwater Institute. The MBR system was managed at a hydraulic retention time of 40.8 h, a solids retention time of 64 +/- 8 days, resulting in a Food: Microorganism ratio of 0.029 day(-1). Results indicated excellent removal efficiency (\%) of TSS (99.65 +/- 0.1 to 99.98 +/- 0.01) and TVs (99.96 +/- 0.01 to 99.99 +/- 0.0) at all salinity levels. Similarly, a 3-4 log(10) removal of total heterotrophic microbes and total coliform was seen at all treatment conditions. Total nitrogen removal efficiency (\%) ranged from 91.8 +/- 2.9 to 95.5 +/- 0.6 at the treatment levels and was consistent, provided a sufficient acclimation period to each new condition was given. Conversely, total phosphorus removal efficiencies (\%) at 0 ppt, 8 ppt, 16 ppt and 32 ppt salinity were 96.1 +/- 1.0, 72.7 +/- 3.5, 70.4 +/- 2.3, and 65.2 +/- 5.4, respectively, indicating reduced phosphorus removal at higher salinities.

This paper revisits the use of centrifuge modelling for offshore geotechnics in the light of the new challenges raised by offshore renewable energy developments. This is illustrated through some aspects of foundation loading regimes such as dynamic tensile loading and multidirectional loading over a large number of cycles, which are specific to offshore renewable energy applications.

TI  - Hydrochars produced by hydrothermal carbonisation of seaweed, coconut shell and oak: effect of processing temperature on physicochemical adsorbent characteristics
JO  - Sn Applied Sciences
PY  - 2022
VL  - 4
IS  - 8
AB  - The present study addresses the production of hydrochars from brown seaweed (Fucus serratus) (FS-HCs), coconut shell (CS-HCs), and oak (Oak-HCs) as potential adsorbents using hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC). The effect of HTC processing temperature on the physicochemical adsorbent characteristics of the hydrochars is investigated at different temperatures (200, 220, 250 degrees C) using a hydrothermal batch reactor. Increasing HTC temperature causes the formation of many spheres in CS-HCs and Oak-HCs, increasing their porosity, except FS-HCs. The surface area of the hydrochars increases with increasing HTC temperature; 10.93-12.78 m(2)/g for FS-HCs, 2.18-21.94 m(2)/g for CS-HCs, except for Oak-HCs which decreases from 4.89 to 3.09 m(2)/g. Increasing HTC temperature decreases volatile matter content in the hydrochars, increases fixed carbon content, and decreases H/C ratio (except for FS-HCs) and O/C ratio of the hydrochars. For all the hydrochars, increasing the HTC temperature results in a slight decrease in zeta potential magnitude, with negatively charged surfaces, making them potential adsorbents for cationic pollutants. The study confirms that the HTC process improves key chemical and physical characteristics of the hydrochars compared to the original biomass, and that the physicochemical adsorbent characteristics are enhanced as the processing temperature increases.

TI  - Environmental and operative impact of the electrification of a double-ended ferry
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2020
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - The increasing sensibility to the environment protection and emission reduction in the atmosphere is also influencing the maritime shipping. The more restrictive regulations on pollutants suggest the adoption of alternative onboard propulsion and energy generation systems. To this end, electrification is a promising solution for pollution reduction, giving some flexibility on the strategy to use for the onboard system. Moreover, a hybrid-electric system can be combined with the exploitation of green fuel, increasing the potential reduction of total emissions. However, the final efficiency, both in term of emission reduction and expected operative expenditure, is strongly influenced by the operative profile of the vessel. This is of utmost importance both in case of a newly designed vessel and in the retrofitting of an existing one. In the present work, the impact of electrification on a double-ended ferry is presented, taking into consideration the operative profile of the vessel derived from real navigation data.

AB  - Hybrid electric powertrain systems present as effective alternatives to traditional vehicle and marine propulsion means with improved fuel efficiency, as well as reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollutants. In this study, a new integrated, model-based design and optimization method for hybrid electric propulsion system of a marine vessel (harbor tugboat) has been introduced. The sizes of key hybrid powertrain components, especially the Li-ion battery energy storage system (ESS), which can greatly affect the shipâ€™s life-cycle cost (LCC), have been optimized using the fuel efficiency, emission and lifecycle cost model of the hybrid powertrain system. Moreover, the control strategies for the hybrid system, which is essential for achieving the minimum fuel consumption and extending battery life, are optimized. For a given powertrain architecture, the optimal design of a hybrid marine propulsion system involves two critical aspects: the optimal sizing of key powertrain components, and the optimal power control and energy management. In this work, a bi-level, nested optimization framework was proposed to address these two intricate problems jointly. The upper level optimization aims at component size optimization, while the lower level optimization carries out optimal operation control through dynamic programming (DP) to achieve the globally minimum fuel consumption and battery degradation for a given vessel load profile. The optimized Latin hypercube sampling (OLHS), Kriging and the widely used Expected Improvement (EI) online sampling criterion are used to carry out â€œsmall dataâ€ driven global optimization to solve this nested optimization problem. The obtained results showed significant reduction of the vessel LCC with the optimized hybrid electric powertrain system design and controls. Reduced engine size and operation time, as well as improved operation efficiency of the hybrid system also greatly decreased the GHG emissions compared to traditional mechanical propulsion.

AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has revised air pollution regulations in MARPOL Annex VI. In 2012 Emission Control Areas (ECA) will limit fuel sulphur content to 1% and from 2015 to 0.1%). NOx emissions based on ships engine speed are also reduced for new vessels (2012 &amp; 2016). Facing this legislation, ship owners have the alternative either to operate ships with costly low-sulphur fuels, or to keep using HFO but together with a gas cleaning equipment at the ship stack in order to reduce the rejected amount of SO2 gas in the atmosphere. To achieve this requirement, research and development organizations came out with proposing a solution that uses a device for cleaning exhaust gas of marine diesel engines. The paper presents a short communication about the DEECON project, which aim is to create a novel on-board after-treatment unit more advanced than any currently available. Each sub-unit of the system will be optimized to remove a specific primary pollutant. In particular, the technology within the DEECON system is based on novel or improved abatement techniques for reducing SOx, NOx, Particulate Matter (PM), CO and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). Some of these technologies are completely new for the maritime sector and they will represent a breakthrough in the reduction of the atmospheric emissions of ships, moving forward the performance of exhaust gas cleaning systems and fostering and anticipating the adoption of future and tighter regulatory requirements. In addition, an after-treatment strategy enables the possible adoption of alternative fuels, which often have their own emissions characteristics.

AB  - Hybrid fuel cell and battery propulsion systems have the potential to offer improved emission performance for coastal ships with access to H-2 replenishment and battery charging infrastructures in ports. However, such systems could be constrained by high power source degradation and energy costs. Cost-effective energy management strategies are essential for such hybrid systems to mitigate the high costs. This article presents a Double Q reinforcement learning based energy management system for such systems to achieve near-optimal average voyage cost. The Double Q agent is trained using stochastic power profiles collected from continuous monitoring of a passenger ferry, using a plug-in hybrid fuel cell and battery propulsion system model. The energy management strategies generated by the agent were validated using another test dataset collected over a different period. The proposed methodology provides a novel approach to optimal use hybrid fuel cell and battery propulsion systems for ships. The results show that without prior knowledge of future power demands, the strategies can achieve near-optimal cost performance (96.9\%) compared to those derived from using dynamic programming with the equivalent state space resolution.

JO  - NANA

VL  - NA

AB  - From the commercial point of view it may be beneficial to install a set of marine current turbines forming a park, by analogy with wind parks. Consequently, this motivates research on park configurations. An array of ten vertical axis marine current turbines is simulated to study how the distance between the turbines affects the performance of the park for different flow directions. The simulations are performed using a two-dimensional vortex method. An array of identical turbines is created, where all turbines are on a single line. The turbines are operated at the tip speed ratio, which corresponds to the highest power coefficient for a single turbine. The distance between the turbines is varied and the total power from the array is compared to the turbine spacing for different flow directions. Additionally, flow data from a real site is used to find an optimal orientation of the line of turbines. The performance of the array is estimated for the site as a function of turbine spacing.

PY  - 2017
VL  - 57
IS  - NA
AB  - This paper examines how the existing fleet in the shipping industry can be adapted to the new emission regulations through the two main techniques that currently exist: (a) the use of low sulphur marine diesels; and (b) the installation of scrubbers. A method is presented here for drawing up an economic assessment of both these techniques under uncertainty. It enables the best option to be selected at any given time taking into account fuel prices (spot and futures), scrubber installation costs, the time that the vessel operates in an Emission Control Area (ECA) and the remaining useful lifetime of the vessel. The paper also considers the possibility of an unexpected change from a non-ECA navigation area to an ECA. The assessment is carried out in a manner consistent with marine diesel and crude oil spot and futures market quotes. Our results show the net present value of investing in the installation of scrubbers and investing in changing fuel types for different assumptions on how vessels are operated. We also analyse increases in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions as a consequence of using scrubbers and how they affects the financial analysis if such incremental emissions must be paid under a CO2 pricing mechanism.

TI  - CO2 injection and storage in porous rocks: coupled geomechanical yielding below failure threshold and permeability evolution
JO  - Petroleum Geoscience
PY  - 2022
VL  - 28
IS  - 1
AB  - With the increasing demand for CO2 storage in the subsurface, it is important to recognize that candidate formations may present complex stress conditions and material characteristics. Consequently, modelling of CO2 injection requires the selection of the most appropriate constitutive material model for the best possible representation of the material response. The authors focus on modelling the geomechanical behaviour of the reservoir material, coupled with a multiphase flow solution of CO2 injection into a saline-saturated medium. It is proposed that the SR3 critical-state material model is used, which considers a direct link between strengthâ€“volumeâ€“permeability that evolves during the simulation; furthermore, the material is considered to yield prior to reaching a peak strength in agreement with experimental observations. Verification of the material model against established laboratory tests is conducted, including multiphase flow accounting for relative permeabilities and fluid densities. Multiphase flow coupled to advanced geomechanics provides a holistic approach to modelling CO2 injection into sandstone reservoirs. The resulting injection pressures, CO2 migration extent and patterns, formation dilation, and strength reduction are compared for a range of in situ porosities and incremental material enhancements. This work aims to demonstrate a numerical modelling framework to aid in the understanding of geomechanical responses to CO2 injection for safe and efficient deployment, and is particularly applicable to CO2 sequestration in less favourable aquifers with a relatively low permeability, receiving CO2 from a limited number of injection wells at high flow rates. The proposed framework can also enable additional features to be incorporated into the model such as faults and detailed overburden representation. Â© 2021 The Author(s).

VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - In the last century, the maritime sector has thrived on using Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), the waste of the petrochemical industry, as a fuel, which has been efficiently and at low cost. The increasing focus on harmful emissions (NOx, SOx, PM) and carbon emission reduction leads to the need of using alternative, cleaner fuels. Royal IHC is a front runner on the adoption of cleaner fuels, with a track record on LNG fueled dredging vessels sailing and on order. Although certainly a cleaner option, LNG is still a fossil fuel. In the future, fossil-free alternative fuels will have to be adopted by the maritime sector. The use of alternative fuels is expected to be accelerated by the emission legislation developments, climate agreements (such as the Paris Agreement) and the introduction of future taxing systems, e.g. carbon taxing. This will be added to the total costs in the economic figures. The shift to zero emission dredgers (zero CO2, SOx, NOx and PM emissions) is expected to accelerate as a consequence of societal acceptance and legislation developments. Royal IHC expects that these developments will lead to a shift in the balance towards clean technologies and carbon-neutral fuels. In this paper alternative fuels are compared on availability, feasibility and C02-equivalent impact. Also alternative drive systems are discussed such as electric drives, batteries and fuel cells. The assessment of alternative fuels requires an approach of Total Cost of Ownership, as each fuel has advantages and disadvantages and a trade-off must to be made between prime mover technology, storage and bunkering technology, investment and fuel costs, and exhaust emissions regulations. The paper will discuss some of the most promising carbonneutral energy carriers for the maritime sector: â€¢ Hydrogen â€¢ Ammonia (hydrogen carrier) â€¢ Renewable methanol â€¢ Batteries â€¢ Solar panels (PV) In order to anticipate to these developments, Royal IHC has taken the challenge to design a hydrogen powered hopper dredger. The number of hydrogen fueled road vehicles is increasing and has boosted the hydrogen technology of fuel cells and storage. This technology can be implemented in dredgers. The consequences with regard to vessel design, safety and operations will be discussed. A zero emission hydrogen powered dredger is presented and seems a viable solution.

AB  - The maritime industry is intensively embracing green thinking. According to the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) strategy, the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping should be reduced by at least 50\% by 2050 compared to 2008. Shipping adopts policies to comply with the set target, including ship redesign, structural retrofit, use of low-carbon material, and the installation of emission abatement technologies. All these approaches pave the way to circularity in the maritime economy, abandoning the linear model in vessel lifetime and adopting lean management, re-manufacturing, and re-usability of the asset. To this end, in the SmartShip project, we give prominence to data-driven ship monitoring by delivering an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) \& Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled holistic cloud-based maritime performance and monitoring system. This system is considering the entire lifecycle of a ship, aiming to optimize energy efficiency, emissions reduction, fuel consumption, while, at the same time, include circular economy concepts in the maritime field. Our approach supports a cost-effective strategy where data analysis drives decisions in ship operation and maintenance.

AB  - In this work, a multi-port converter (MPC) design is presented that works as the key building block of a marine microgrid. An emulated wave energy converter (WEC) serves as the renewable energy resource of this microgrid system. The proposed MPC is comprised or a WEC interfacing port, energy storage port, and a split-phase AC load/grid port. Stable power exchange among these dissimilar energy resources are facilitated through a 400V internal DC bus. The full MPC design along with its control and thermal model is developed and implemented in PLECS. Commercially available SiC power modules have been used to leverage its high switching frequency capability that to achieve compact system design with reduced passive component sizes. Individual controller for each energy resource interfacing converter is analyzed, developed and implemented initially. A state-machine is developed utilizing these discrete controllers for MPC operation where all three ports are active simultaneously. These discretized controllers along with voltage/current sensor models with limited bandwidth and response delay in the feedback path are implemented in PLECS to emulate practical controller deployment. Simulation results are provided to validate both the power stage and the discrete controller design. Furthermore, iterative thermal analysis is carried out to have a realistic estimation of the device junction temperature during rated condition to evaluate the efficacy of the thermal management system. Finally, a virtual prototype design of the MPC is presented.

JO  - Plos One

VL  - 6

AB  - Background: CO2 emissions from cleared mangrove areas may be substantial, increasing the costs of continued losses of these ecosystems, particularly in mangroves that have highly organic soils. Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured CO2 efflux from mangrove soils that had been cleared for up to 20 years on the islands of Twin Cays, Belize. We also disturbed these cleared peat soils to assess what disturbance of soils after clearing may have on CO2 efflux. CO2 efflux from soils declines from time of clearing from ~10 600 tonnes km-2 year-1 in the first year to 3000 tonnes km2 year-1 after 20 years since clearing. Disturbing peat leads to short term increases in CO2 efflux (27 umol m-2 s-1), but this had returned to baseline levels within 2 days. Conclusions/Significance: Deforesting mangroves that grow on peat soils results in CO2 emissions that are comparable to rates estimated for peat collapse in other tropical ecosystems. Preventing deforestation presents an opportunity for countries to benefit from carbon payments for preservation of threatened carbon stocks. Â© 2011 Lovelock et al.

AB  - Coastal restoration through diversion of suspended sediments from the Lower Mississippi River (LMR) into hydrologically isolated marshlands of Mid-Barataria Bay and Mid-Breton Sounds in southern Louisiana has the potential to mobilize lead (Pb), and other trace elements. We investigate the potential impact(s) of the diversion on marsh porewater through analysis of modern riverbank and suspended sediments, compared to sediments from pre-industrial deltaic deposits of LMR. Sequential extraction methods were used to evaluate Pb, cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) in the sediments. Our results show that metal contents are higher (e.g., 8- to 10-fold for Pb) in the modern sediments relative to pre-industrial deposits. Also, the reducible fraction, presumably iron/manganese (Fe/Mn) oxides/oxyhydroxides, is the chief reservoir of environmentally available metals. The substantially higher trace metal contents of the modern relative to pre-industrial sediments suggest that the modern sediments contain a sizeable amount of anthropogenic contributions. Furthermore, the concentration of the trace metals in the reducible fraction suggests bioavailability to marsh organisms upon reductive dissolution within the planned, constructed coastal marshes. Still, additional sediment samples from the marshlands during the diversion implementation phase will be necessary to support the preliminary findings in this contribution as it affects coastal marshes and vital local fisheries.

PY  - 2021
VL  - 27
IS  - 11
AB  - Climate change impacts on marine life in the world ocean are expected to accelerate over the 21st century, affecting the structure and functioning of food webs. We analyzed a key aspect of this issue, focusing on the impact of changes in biomass flow within marine food webs and the resulting effects on ecosystem biomass and production. We used a modeling framework based on a parsimonious quasi-physical representation of biomass flow through the food web, to explore the future of marine consumer biomass and production at the global scale over the 21st century. Biomass flow is determined by three climate-related factors: primary production entering the food web, trophic transfer efficiency describing losses in biomass transfers from one trophic level (TL) to the next, and flow kinetic measuring the speed of biomass transfers within the food web. Using climate projections of three earth system models, we calculated biomass and production at each TL on a 1Â° latitudeÂ Ã—1Â° longitude grid of the global ocean under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios. We show that the alterations of the trophic functioning of marine ecosystems, mainly driven by faster and less efficient biomass transfers and decreasing primary production, would lead to a projected decline in total consumer biomass by 18.5% by 2090â€“2099 relative to 1986â€“2005 under the â€œno mitigation policyâ€ scenario. The projected decrease in transfer efficiency is expected to amplify impacts at higher TLs, leading to a 21.3% decrease in abundance of predators and thus to a change in the overall trophic structure of marine ecosystems. Marine animal production is also projected to decline but to a lesser extent than biomass. Our study highlights that the temporal and spatial projected changes in biomass and production would imply direct repercussions on the future of world fisheries and beyond all services provided by Ocean.

VL  - 760

AB  - Mangrove ecosystems can be both significant sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Understanding variability in flux and the key factors controlling emissions in these ecosystems are therefore important in the context of accounting for GHG emissions. The current study is the first to quantify GHG emissions using static chamber measurements from soils in disused aquaculture ponds, planted mangroves, and mature mangroves from the Ayeyarwady Delta, Myanmar. Soil properties, biomass and estimated net primary productivity were also assessed. Field assessments were conducted at the same sites during the middle of the dry season in February and end of the wet season in October 2019. Rates of soil CO2 efflux were among the highest yet recorded from mangrove ecosystems, with CO2 efflux from the 8 year old site reaching 86.8 Â± 17 Mg CO2 haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 during February, an average of 862% more than all other sites assessed during this period. In October, all sites had significant rates of soil CO2 efflux, with rates ranging from 31.9 Â± 4.4 Mg CO2 haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 in a disused pond to 118.9 Â± 24.3 Mg CO2 haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 in the 8 year old site. High soil CO2 efflux from the 8 year old site in February is most likely attributable to high rates of primary production and belowground carbon allocation. Elevated CO2 efflux from all sites during October was likely associated with the extreme 2019 South Asian monsoon season which lowered soil pore salinity and deposited new alluvium, stimulating both autotrophic and heterotrophic activity. Methane efflux increased significantly (50â€“400%) during the wet season from all sites with mangrove cover, although was a small overall component of soil GHG effluxes during both measurement periods. Our results highlight the critical importance of assessing GHG flux in-situ in order to quantify variability in carbon dynamics over time. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

PY  - 2022
VL  - 379
IS  - 2
AB  - Recently, several countries have focused on industrial decarbonization to ensure that the net emissions of carbon dioxide reach zero and contribute to decreasing the global mean temperature. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of a net-zero carbon roadmap for the petrochemical industry by 1) developing an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based generative model to produce stochastic scenarios for offshore wind power in an elec-trical grid, and 2) conducting techno-economic and environmental assessments for forecasting models that define offshore wind power networks. Firstly, data processing techniques were utilized on remotely sensed offshore wind speed datasets and energy data obtained from petrochemical industrial parks. Second, a generative model was designed using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to produce different forecast scenarios of offshore wind power. Third, stochastic scenarios were developed by considering behavioral characteristics of offshore wind power with stochastic scenario uncertainties. Finally, we investigated the techno-economic and environmental assessments of the proposed renewable energy networks. Comparing to the case of offshore wind power in 2022, The proposed XAI-driven net-zero carbon roadmap indicated that the total cost of electricity generation and fossil fuel cost with carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be reduced by 4\% and 42\% with 41\% reduction of CO2 emission. Ultimately, this may be implemented in industrial parks to aid in efforts towards carbon neutrality.

TI  - Carbon Leakage: The Impact of Asymmetric Regulation on Carbon-Emitting Production
JO  - Production And Operations Management
PY  - 2021
VL  - 30
IS  - 6
AB  - Regions with carbon emission regulations bear the risk of â€œcarbon leakageâ€ if local producers shift production capacity to an unregulated region. We investigate the problem for a producer subject to geographically asymmetric emission regulation with uncertain future emission price. The producer has two ex ante options to lower its compliance cost: investing in clean production technology in the regulated region and building production capacity in the unregulated region. The producer determines its production quantities ex post, after emission price uncertainty is resolved. We study two anti-leakage policies, Border Tax (BT) and Output-Based Allocation (OB), where the former adopts a â€œstickâ€ approach that penalizes offshore production and the latter adopts a â€œcarrotâ€ approach that grants free emission allowances for production in the regulated region. First, we show that the emission price uncertainty can exert opposing effects in the absence of an anti-leakage policy: When the expected emission price is low (high), a higher uncertainty aggravates (mitigates) carbon leakage. Second, through a comprehensive comparison, we highlight that while both BT and OB are able to reduce carbon leakage, BT has a stronger effect in both the regulated and unregulated regions in multiple dimensions, especially when the carbon leakage risk is high. Third, we find that a higher emission price uncertainty weakens the effect of both BT and OB. We therefore suggest that emission price uncertainty should be accounted for when formulating anti-leakage policies. Finally, we extend our analysis to a competitive case and find that the superiority of BT relative to OB is enhanced. Â© 2020 Production and Operations Management Society

TI  - Winter weather controls net influx of atmospheric CO2 on the northwest European shelf
JO  - Scientific Reports
PY  - 2019
VL  - 9
IS  - NA
AB  - Shelf seas play an important role in the global carbon cycle, absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and exporting carbon (C) to the open ocean and sediments. The magnitude of these processes is poorly constrained, because observations are typically interpolated over multiple years. Here, we used 298500 observations of CO2 fugacity (fCO(2)) from a single year (2015), to estimate the net influx of atmospheric CO2 as 26.2 +/- 4.7 Tg C yr(-1) over the open NW European shelf. CO2 influx from the atmosphere was dominated by influx during winter as a consequence of high winds, despite a smaller, thermally-driven, air-sea fCO(2) gradient compared to the larger, biologically-driven summer gradient. In order to understand this climate regulation service, we constructed a carbon-budget supplemented by data from the literature, where the NW European shelf is treated as a box with carbon entering and leaving the box. This budget showed that net C-burial was a small sink of 1.3 +/- 3.1 Tg C yr(-1), while CO2 efflux from estuaries to the atmosphere, removed the majority of river C-inputs. In contrast, the input from the Baltic Sea likely contributes to net export via the continental shelf pump and advection (34.4 +/- 6.0 Tg C yr(-1)).

PY  - 2016
VL  - 59
IS  - NA
AB  - Voltage Source Converter (VSC) High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) connection has become a new trend for long distance offshore wind power transmission. It has been confirmed by a lot of research that the maximum distance of a High Voltage Alternative Current (HVAC) sub-marine cable transmission system is limited due to surplus charging current of the cables. The VSC HVDC transmission system has the ability to overcome the limitation and offers other advantages over the HVAC transmission system. This paper is to review the VSC HVDC transmission technology and its application for offshore wind power integration. Firstly, the main components, configuration and topology of the VSC HVDC transmission system are described. Secondly, the converter control system and control strategies are presented. Following that, the capabilities of the VSC HVDC technology are described. Finally, the focus is given on the control methods of the VSC HVDC transmission system for fulfilling grid code requirements concerning Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) and frequency regulation.

PY  - 2014
VL  - 1
IS  - 12
AB  - The percentage of electricity produced by renewable energy sources grows rapidly during last years. But high-power renewable energy sources like offshore or onshore wind farms in coastal regions are located very often far from consumers. The task of the energy transport over long distances becomes more and more important. Due to the difficulties finding new corridors for the extra high voltage (EHV) transmission lines in densely populated countries with developed infrastructure is often recommended to combine the new transmission line with other infrastructure objects like railways, highways and other transmission lines. One of theoretical possibilities is the use of common pylons for the installation of a new EHV transmission line together with catenary of electrified railway lines. Another one is the laying of HVDC cable parallel to the rail line. The proximity of different current feeding systems causes the electromagnetic interaction between transmission line and catenary. These interferences can disturb the operation of both systems. On the base of mathematical modelling of electromagnetic interferences between transmission lines and catenary the interaction between both systems is considered in the offered paper.

AB  - Operation and maintenance constitute a substantial share of the lifecycle expenditures of an offshore renewable energy farm. A noteworthy number of methods and techniques have been developed to provide decision-making support in strategic planning and asset management. Condition monitoring instrumentation is commonly used, especially in offshore wind farms, due to the benefits it provides in terms of fault identification and performance evaluation and improvement. Incorporating technology advancements, a shift towards automation and digitalisation is taking place in the offshore maintenance sector. This paper reviews the existing literature and novel approaches in the operation and maintenance planning and the condition monitoring of offshore renewable energy farms, with an emphasis on the offshore wind sector, discussing their benefits and limitations. The state-of-the-art in industrial condition-based maintenance is reviewed, together with deterioration models and fault diagnosis and prognosis techniques. Future scenarios in robotics, artificial intelligence and data processing are investigated. The application challenges of these strategies and Industry 4.0 concepts in the offshore renewables sector are scrutinised, together with the potential implications of early-stage project integration. The identified technologies are ranked against a series of indicators, providing a reference for a range of industry stakeholders. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The global warming problem is concerned in the world. The Japanese Government has formalized the acceptance of Kyoto Protocol on 4th of June 2002. Under the Protocol, Japan has an obligation of greenhouse gas (CO2 etc) emissions reduction of 6% below 1990 levels for the first commitment period of 2008-2012. The restriction concerning the exhaust of NOx and SOx by ships is discussed in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Under the Ministry's of Land Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) national research project named the Super Eco-Ship Project, the National Maritime Research Institute of Japan (NMRI) has been played major role of it since April 2001. Super Eco-Ship would embody a technical breakthrough in meeting certain requirements of coastal shipping such as reducing the burden on the environment and the logistics costs and improving the living and working conditions on board. Super eco-ship has highly efficient electrical propulsion system featuring the podded propulsor with contra-rotating propeller (CRP). Advanced concept and systems are applied in the research and development of the Super Eco-Ship. Flexibility in the arrangement of main engine and in the hull form design is realized by the electric propulsion system. New design tools based advanced concept and methodology are applied. Hull form design method by means of CFD simulation and CAD are performed to design optimum hull form for electric propulsion system. The high propulsive efficiency due to the combination with the optimum hull design and podded propulsor enables the reduction of CO2 compared with the conventional ship. The podded propulsor with CRP enables drastically good maneuverability and flexible control system in ship operation as well as high propulsive efficiency. The pilot becomes easy operation in berthing time by the control system of the podded propulsor. In August 2004, a reliability test run of a prototype of the propulsor including the motors and sealing/bearing was completed in a dock.The practicality of poded propulsor with CRP was confirmed from this result. In this paper, the results of this test and environmental assessment of super eco-ship is reported. Copyright Â© 2005 by The International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers.

AB  - Offshore wind energy is a key technology towards the extension of renewable energy. State of the art foundations for wind turbines are based on pile driving, where steel piles are driven deeply into the seafloor by a hydraulic hammer. As a result of this pile driving, significant sound emissions into the surrounding water column occur that can have harmful effects on marine life, like e.g. the harbor porpoise. At present, various sound mitigation measures are being developed and tested under offshore conditions. Within the scope of the research project "BORA - Berechnung von Offshore-Rammschall", a profound model to predict near and far field sound levels with respect to varying foundation structures as well as different sound mitigation measures is being developed. Extensive offshore tests serve as model validation. This article provides insight into the pile driving noise problematic and the current state of research of the BORA project.

PY  - 2009
VL  - 56
IS  - 8-10
AB  - Despite their moderately sized surface area, continental marginal seas play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, as they receive huge amounts of upwelled and riverine inputs of carbon and nutrients, sustaining a disproportionate large biological activity compared to their relative surface area. A synthesis of worldwide measurements of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) indicates that most open shelves in the temperate and high-latitude regions are under-saturated with respect to atmospheric CO2 during all seasons, although the low-latitude shelves seem to be over-saturated. Most inner estuaries and near-shore coastal areas on the other hand are over-saturated with respect to atmospheric CO2. The scaling of air-sea CO2 fluxes based on pCO2 measurements and carbon mass-balance calculations indicate that the continental shelves absorb atmospheric CO2 ranging between 0.33 and 0.36 Pg C yr-1 that corresponds to an additional sink of 27% to âˆ¼30% of the CO2 uptake by the open oceans based on the most recent pCO2 climatology [Takahashi, T., Sutherland, S.C., Wanninkhof, R., Sweeney, C., Feely, R.A., Chipman, D., Hales, B., Friederich, G., Chavez, F., Watson, A., Bakker, D., Schuster, U., Metzl, N., Inoue, H.Y., Ishii, M., Midorikawa, T., Sabine, C., Hoppema, M., Olafsson, J., Amarson, T., Tilbrook, B., Johannessen, T., Olsen, A., Bellerby, R., De Baar, H., Nojiri, Y., Wong, C.S., Delille, B., Bates, N., 2009.

Inner estuaries, salt marshes and mangroves emit up to 0.50 Pg C yr-1, although these estimates are prone to large uncertainty due to poorly constrained ecosystem surface area estimates. Nevertheless, the view of continental shelves as sinks and near-shore ecosystems as sources of atmospheric CO2 allows reconciling long-lived opposing views on carbon cycling in the coastal ocean.

JO  - Energies

VL  - 15
IS  - 9
AB  - Modern observations and geological records suggest that anthropogenic ocean warming could destabilise marine methane hydrate, resulting in methane release from the seafloor to the ocean-atmosphere, and potentially triggering a positive feedback on global temperature. On the decadal to millennial timescales over which hydrate-sourced methane release is hypothesized to occur, several processes consuming methane below and above the seafloor have the potential to slow, reduce or even prevent such release. Yet, the modulating effect of these processes on seafloor methane emissions remains poorly quantified, and the full impact of benthic methane consumption on ocean carbon chemistry is still to be explored. In this review, we document the dynamic interplay between hydrate thermodynamics, benthic transport and biogeochemical reaction processes, that ultimately determines the impact of hydrate destabilisation on seafloor methane emissions and the ocean carbon cycle. Then, we provide an overview of how state-of-the-art numerical models treat such processes and examine their ability to quantify hydrate-sourced methane emissions from the seafloor, as well as their impact on benthic biogeochemical cycling. We discuss the limitations of current models in coupling the dynamic interplay between hydrate thermodynamics and the different reaction and transport processes that control the efficiency of the benthic sink, and highlight their shortcoming in assessing the full implication of methane release on ocean carbon cycling. Finally, we recommend that current Earth system models explicitly account for hydrate driven benthic-pelagic exchange fluxes to capture potential hydrate-carbon cycle-climate feed-backs.

AB  - The shipping industry is associated with approximately three quarters of all world trade. In recent years, the sustainability of shipping has become a public concern, and various emissions control regulations to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships have been proposed and implemented globally. These regulations aim to drive the shipping industry in a low-carbon and low-pollutant direction by motivating it to switch to more efficient fuel types and reduce energy consumption. At the same time, the cyclical downturn of the world economy and high bunker prices make it necessary and urgent for the shipping industry to operate in a more cost-effective way while still satisfying global trade demand. As bunker fuel bunker (e.g., heavy fuel oil {[}HFO], liquified natural gas {[}LNG]) consumption is the main source of emissions and bunker fuel costs account for a large proportion of operating costs, shipping companies are making unprecedented efforts to optimize ship energy efficiency. It is widely accepted that the key to improving the energy efficiency of ships is the development of accurate models to predict ship fuel consumption rates under different scenarios. In this study, ship fuel consumption prediction models presented in the literature (including the academic literature and technical reports as a typical type of ``grey literature{''}) are reviewed and compared, and models that optimize ship operations based on fuel consumption prediction results are also presented and discussed. Current research challenges and promising research questions on ship performance monitoring and operational optimization are identified.

PY  - 2020
VL  - 13
IS  - 23
AB  - A review of the ongoing research on black start (BS) service integrated with offshore wind farms (OWFs) is presented in this paper. The overall goal is to firstly gain a better understanding of the BS capabilities required by modern power systems. Subsequently, the challenges faced by OWFs as novel BS service providers as well as an outlook on the ongoing research which may provide solutions to these are presented. OWFs have the potential to be a fast and environmentally friendly technology to provide BS services for power system restoration and, therefore, to ensure resiliency after blackouts. As a power electronic-based system, OWFs can be equipped with a self-starter in the system in order to perform BS. The self-start unit could be a synchronous generator (SG) or a power electronic unit such as a grid-forming (GFM) converter. Preliminary BS studies performed in PSCAD/EMTDC are presented in a simplified OWF system via an SG as the self-start unit. Consequently, technical challenges during the BS procedure in an OWF benchmark system are outlined via theoretical discussions and simulations results. This is useful to understand the threats to power electronics during BS. Finally, the most relevant GFM strategies in the state-of-the-art literature are presented and their application to OWF BS is discussed. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Detecting the effects of introduced artificial structures on the marine environment relies upon research and monitoring programs that can provide baseline data and the necessary statistical power to detect biological and/or ecological change over relevant spatial and temporal scales. Here we report on, and assess the use of, Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) systems as a technique to monitor diversity, abundance and assemblage composition data to evaluate the effects of marine renewable energy infrastructure on mobile epi-benthic species. The results from our five-year study at a wave energy development facility demonstrate how annual natural variation (time) and survey design (spatial scale and power) are important factors in the ability to robustly detect change in common ecological metrics of benthic and bentho-pelagic ecosystems of the northeast Atlantic. BRUV systems demonstrate their capacity for use in temperate, high energy marine environments, but also how weather, logistical and technical issues require increased sampling effort to ensure statistical power to detect relevant change is achieved. These factors require consideration within environmental impact assessments if such survey methods are to identify and contribute towards the management of potential positive or negative effects on benthic systems.

VL  - 76

AB  - Increasing atmospheric pCO(2) leads to seawater acidification, which has attracted considerable attention due to its potential impact on the marine biological carbon pump and function of marine ecosystems. Alternatively, phytoplankton cells living in coastal waters might experience increased pH/decreased pCO(2) (seawater alkalization) caused by metabolic activities of other photoautotrophs, or after microalgal blooms. Here we grew Thalassiosira weissflogii (diatom) at seven pCO(2) levels, including habitat-related lowered levels (25, 50, 100, and 200 mu atm) as well as present-day (400 mu atm) and elevated (800 and 1600 mu atm) levels. Effects of seawater acidification and alkalization on growth, photosynthesis, dark respiration, cell geometry, and biogenic silica content of T. weissflogii were investigated. Elevated pCO(2) and associated seawater acidification had no detectable effects. However, the lowered pCO(2) levels (25 similar to 100 mu atm), which might be experienced by coastal diatoms in post-bloom scenarios, significantly limited growth and photosynthesis of this species. In addition, seawater alkalization resulted in more silicified cells with higher dark respiration rates. Thus, a negative correlation of biogenic silica content and growth rate was evident over the pCO(2) range tested here. Taken together, seawater alkalization, rather than acidification, could have stronger effects on the ballasting efficiency and carbon export of T. weissflogii.

The author studys the effect of adding different amount of carbon source on removal efficiency of TN, NH4+-N, NO3--N, NO2--N and COD in the system. The results of the study show that: when the adding amount of alkaline straw are 0, 100g and 400g, NH4+-N average removal efficiency are respectively 59.9\%, 66.96\% and 71.91\%; NO3--N average removal efficiency are respectively 54.89\%, 72.33\% and 81.36\%; NO2--N average removal efficiency are respectively 12.76\%, 24.91\% and 40.97\%; TN average removal efficiency are respectively 23.14\%, 41.32\% and 64\%; COD average removal efficiency are respectively 83.94\%, 81.29\% and 77.85\%. Alkali-treated corn straw can provide the carbon source that denitrification required for artificial wetland system. The added carbon source can significantly improve the nitrogen removal efficiency of the system, and the nitrogen removal efficiency of adding 400g alkali-treated corn straw is better than adding 100g alkali-treated corn straw, and it is not a burden for the system.

AB  - Shipping is commonly believed to be the most energy efficient mode of transport. Nonetheless, the shipping industry is required to reduce its environmental impact. The IMO has developed a package of measures for reducing shipping's CO2 emissions within an agreed timetable for adoption (Energy Efficiency Design Index for the design of new ships and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan for the operational phase). Approximately three-quarters of the vessels are rather young, so most ships in operation need solutions to reduce their pollution. In general, the suitable solutions differ from ship newbuilding, in which hull form optimization and newest machinery technology can be readily employed. This paper will demonstrate how simulation-driven design using the CAE platform FRIENDSHIP-Framework, coupled to the viscous flow CFD solver SHIPFLOW, can be used to efficiently develop optimized solutions for the retrofitting of ships in operation. Systematic variation as well as formal optimization is used in the process, coupling automated generation of geometry variants to simulation. The retrofitting solutions that will be covered are measures to decrease the resistance or increase the propulsive efficiency of the ship. Typical examples are energy-saving devices that are added to the ship or replacing parts of the hull or the appendages with new, optimized shapes. The validity of the concept will be demonstrated with the results from case studies that include a motor yacht, as well as a commercial RoPax ship.

AB  - We investigated the dynamics of carbonate system which was greatly modulated by a river plume and coastal upwelling in July 2014 and July 2015 at the east coast of Hainan Island where a fringing reef distributes inshore. By using a three end-member mixing model, we semiquantitatively estimated the removal of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) mediated by biological production in the river plume and upwelled water to be 13 +/- 17 and 15 +/- 16 mu mol kg(-1), respectively. The enhanced organic production was mainly responsible for these DIC consumptions in both two regimes, however, nearly a half of DIC removal was attributed to biocalcification in the plume system while it was negligible in the upwelling system. Furthermore, the modeled results over reefs revealed that river plume and coastal upwelling were two major threats of acidification to coral communities at the east coast of Hainan Island during cruises. In comparison, the biological contribution to acidification was limited for balancing between organic production and biocalcification during July 2014 cruise, whereas the acidification was greatly intensified by organic degradation during July 2015 cruise. It was verified that naturally local acidification (physical and biological processes) played a major role in great pH decreases on a short-term scale, leading to coastal waters more vulnerable to anthropogenic ocean acidification (uptake of atmospheric CO2) by reducing buffering capacity of waters. Finally, effects of acidification associated with other local threats on a fringing reef were further depicted with a conceptual model.

AB  - Increasing amounts of ships exhaust gases emitted worldwide forced the International Maritime Organization to issue some restricted maritime legislation for reducing the adverse environmental impacts arising from such emissions. Consequently, ships emission reduction became one of the technical and economical challenges that facing the ships, operators. The present paper addresses the different strategies that can be used to reduce those emissions, especially nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. The strategies included: applying reduction technologies onboard, using of alternative fuels, and follows one of fuel saving strategies. Using of selective catalytic reduction and sea water scrubbing appeared as the best reduction technologies onboard ships. Moreover, among the various proposed alternative fuels, natural gas, in its liquid state; has the priority to be used instead of conventional fuels. Applying one of those strategies is the matter of ship type and working area. As a numerical example, the proposed methods were investigated at a high-speed craft operating in the Red Sea area between Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The results obtained are very satisfactory from the point of view of environment and economic issues, and reflected the importance of applying those strategies. Â© SNAK, 2014.

TI  - THE POTENTIAL OF METHANOL AS AN ALTERNATIVE MARINE FUEL FOR INDONESIAN DOMESTIC SHIPPING
JO  - International Journal Of Maritime Engineering
PY  - 2020
VL  - 162
IS  - A2
AB  - This analysis aims to provide insight and to explore the future usage of methanol as an alternative marine fuel for domestic ships in Indonesia. An overview of potential application, analysis of resources availability, and stakeholder readiness on the topic are provided; related challenges are also identified and further examined. The potential performance of methanol as a fuel is discussed and evaluated via two different perspectives (the shipowner perspective and the government one) through case studies of two passenger ships owned by the shipping company Pelayaran Indonesia (PELNI): MV. Labobar and MV. Gunung Dempo. As shipowners tend to look very closely at the economic aspects, a feasibility study is performed by developing a combinatorial scenario approach based on the combination of economic measures of merit (NPV and payback period) along with a technical scenario (main-pilot fuel setup); the variables included in the calculation are: ship age, ship productivity, and macro-economy conditions. Regarding the government perspective, the main issues are environmental protection and policy compliance. These issues are evaluated by examining six emission types (NOx, SOx, CO2, CH4, N2O, and PM). Additionally, since there is a trade-off situation in government subsidies between the government and shipowner interests, an optimization and sensitivity analysis is performed by utilizing a combinatorial scenario model to determine optimum methanol price and external variables influencing the decision to support further use of methanol in the Indonesian market. An important finding was that Indonesia has certain advantages/drives to introduce methanol as a marine fuel. However, methanol competitiveness is mainly dependent on ship productivity and the price difference between methanol and marine diesel oil (MDO). Additionally, policy analysis (through an optimization approach) could be one of the government options in order to determine the optimum condition in establishing methanol as a marine fuel. Finally, short, medium, and long term recommendations are also provided as the basis for future consideration.

AB  - This chapter provides an outline of the issues confronting the designer of an ocean energy converter (OEC) when selecting or designing the electrical generator and its associated control system. It is clear that, especially for wave energy converters (WECs), this is a complex problem due to the high variance in device power take-off (PTO) type, and indeed the functionality of the generator itself within the power chain. Specification and design of the generator system in tidal energy converters (TECs) have been reviewed and shown to be highly dependent on the device, turbine and current characteristics. Both squirrel cage induction generators (SCIGs) and permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) are promising generator technologies for application in TECs, showing individual advantages and disadvantages. As important as the choice of the generator technology are the concepts to deal with the special requirements of TEC devices like marine environment, submerged operation and extended maintenance intervals. A consistent requirement in both WEC and TEC system generators is the need for variable speed control and operation. In this context, the power converter technology and controller algorithms related to this need have been introduced. Â© The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.

TI  - The Role of Wave Energy Converter Farms in Coastal Protection
JO  - NANA
PY  - 2018
VL  - NA
IS  - NA
AB  - Many worldwide coasts are under erosion with climate projections indicating that damages will rise in future decades. Specifically, deltaic coasts are highly vulnerable systems due to their low-lying characteristics. This chapter investigates the role of wave energy converter (WEC) farms on the protection of an eroding gravel-dominated deltaic coast (Guadalfeo, southern Spain). Eight scenarios with different alongshore locations of the wave farm were defined and results were compared with the present (no farm) configuration of the coast. Assuming that storm conditions drive the main destruction to the coast, we analysed the impact of the most energetic storm conditions and quantified the effects of the location of the farm. Significant wave heights in the lee of the farm were calculated by means of a calibrated wave propagation model (Delft3D-Wave); whereas wave run-up and morphological changes in eight beach profiles were quantified by means of a calibrated morphodynamic model (XBeach-G). The farm induces average reductions in significant wave heights at 10m water depth and wave run-up on the coast down to 18.3\% and 10.6\%, respectively, in the stretch of beach most affected by erosion problems (Playa Granada). Furthermore, the erosion of the beach reduces by 44.5\% in Playa Granada and 23.3\% in the entire deltaic coast. Combining these results with previous works at the study site allowed selecting the best alternative of wave farm location based not only on coastal protection but also on energetic performance criteria. This chapter, whose methodology is feasibly extensible to other coasts worldwide, provides insights into the role of the alongshore location of WEC farms on wave propagation, run-up and morphological storm response of deltaic coasts.

AB  - The development of environmentally friendly and sustainable corrosion protection technologies is a longstanding yet difficult problem, especially for the marine environment. The utilization of living biofilms isolated from local environments is an effective strategy for infrastructure protection. In this study, three aerobic marine bacteria, Tenacibaculum mesophilum D-6, Tenacibaculum litoreum W-4, and Bacillus sp. Y-6, with strong biofilmforming abilities were isolated and evaluated for the corrosion protection of X80 carbon steel. The corrosion inhibitory effect of the bacteria was found to be closely related to their biofilmforming abilities. This conclusion was corroborated by biofilm characterization, electrochemical tests, weight loss analysis, and corrosion product analysis. Moreover, secreted extracellular polymeric substances were identified to play significant roles in corrosion inhibition. Herein, we proposed a novel, eco-friendly, and cost-effective method for corrosion protection of carbon steels in the marine environment, providing guiding principles for identifying corrosion inhibitory bacteria from the local marine environment.

PY  - 2019
VL  - 253
IS  - NA
AB  - Mangrove soil carbon stocks are known to decrease following forest loss due to respiration and enhanced soil CO 2 emissions. However, changes in carbon outwelling to the coastal ocean due to mangrove forest disturbance have not been considered. In December 2015, an extremely large mangrove dieback event (âˆ¼7000 hectares, spanning 1000 km of coastline) occurred in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia. To assess the effect this dieback event had on carbon outwelling, we used radium isotopes and dissolved carbon measurements (dissolved organic carbon, DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC, and total alkalinity, TAlk) to estimate cross-shelf carbon transport from living and dead mangrove areas and to calculate the carbon losses from living and dead forest soils via SGD. Radium distributions imply cross shelf eddy diffusivity of 107.5 Â± 26.9 and 104.6 Â± 23.9 m âˆ’2 s âˆ’1 from dead and living areas and radium water ages reveal that mangrove carbon reaches 10 km offshore within 7 days. Outwelling rates from living and dead areas were explained by soil carbon losses via SGD. This study suggests a decrease in carbon outwelling to the ocean from dead forest areas compares to living areas by 0â€“12% for DOC, 50â€“52% for DIC and by 37â€“51% for TAlk âˆ¼8 months after the dieback event occurred. Changes to oceanic carbon outwelling rates following mangrove loss are likely driven by a gradual depletion of carbon stocks from the sediment profile. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - New environmental regulations indicate that a 'business as usual' approach is no longer an option towards sustainable shipping. LNG is one of the potential alternative solutions to help meet the specified IMO fuel sulphur content limits since it contains only traces of sulphur. Gas and dual fuel (DF) engines utilizing the Otto combustion process can produce NOx emissions below the IMO Tier III limits, and the C/H ratio of LNG allows a significant fuel based reduction of CO2 emissions also. This paper discusses the challenges involved and how these were met when considering LNG as fuel in an ocean-going dry bulk carrier, with a focus on the main challenges involved with CAPEX and engine technologies and their effect on vessel design. The study was conducted by Arista Shipping in conjunction with the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) and WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤, and was based on a representative bulk carrier design, an 82,000 dwt Kamsarmax vessel, which was selected as the project platform due to its proven design and high cargo capacity.

We show a case study of the Greater Sleipner Area where acquisition of sonar data revealed a fracture on the seafloor. This has led us to investigate the shallow subsurface in this area with regard to seal integrity using 3D seismic data.

JO  - Iet Renewable Power Generation
PY  - 2021
VL  - 15

AB  - A plate-wave energy converter (pWEC) moored in front of a floating stationary breakwater is considered. The pWEC is composed of a submerged flexible plate with piezoelectric layers bonded to both faces of it. Hence the elastic motion of the plate excited by water waves can be transformed into useful electricity due to the piezoelectric effect. To evaluate the performance of the breakwater-attached pWEC in terms of wave power absorption and wave attenuation, a hydroelastic model based on linear potential flow theory and the eigenfunction matching method is developed with the electromechanical and the hydrodynamic problems of the pWEC coupled together. The pWEC can be either simply supported or clamped at the edge. A multi-parameter analysis is carried out with the employment of the present model. Effects of the width, submergence and edge types of the plate, together with the scales of the breakwater, including its width and draft, on wave power absorption and wave attenuation, are examined. As the pWEC moves towards a deeper position, the main peaks of the frequency response of the wave power absorption efficiency become lower and narrower. In contrast, its effect on wave attenuation isÂ limited. Â© 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Crab Bioturbation and Herbivory May Account for Variability in Carbon Sequestration and Stocks in South West Atlantic Salt Marshes
JO  - Frontiers In Marine Science
PY  - 2016
VL  - 3
IS  - NA
AB  - Coastal vegetation plays an important role for climate change mitigation. Compared with terrestrial ecosystems, coastal vegetation shows higher rates of atmospheric CO2 uptake and a more efficient retention of carbon (C) in sediments. Salt marshes present the highest values as C binders, although a global estimation of these values is still pending due to regional gaps in the records predominantly from the southern hemisphere. There are no clear patterns or dominant processes with enough evidence to account for the observed variability, suggesting that context dependent processes are likely greatest influencers on C storage. Salt marshes in the South West Atlantic (SWA) coast are densely populated by the intertidal burrowing and herbivore crab Neohelice (=Chasmagnathus) granulata. Many ecological processes related to C transformation occurring in these salt marshes are influenced by crab activities, either through bioturbation or via herbivory. We hypothesize that N. granulata could have a significant role in the capacity of SWA salt marshes to bind C. Reduction of plant biomass, increased aerobic decomposition in the sediment and facilitation of erosion are some of the multiple effects exerted by N. granulata that can directly and indirectly modify the capacity of salt marshes to bind C. Here, we compiled information available regarding C sequestration and accumulation in SWA coastal salt marshes and propose a hypothetical model including the mechanisms mediated by N. granulata that interfere the transformation paths of C in salt marshes. The data suggest that mechanisms that are top-down regulated, negatively affect C accumulation in the form of aboveground biomass especially in salt marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora. While, mechanisms mediated by bioturbation can negatively (increasing oxygenation and thus facilitating aerobic degradation) affect as well as positively (increasing retention of macrodetritus) affect the accumulation of C, the latter being of greater magnitude in Spartina densiflora salt marshes.

AB  - The shipping industry is a hard-to-abate sector in today's society. Although past studies have looked at levels of carbon pricing, fuel savings, and the upscaling of green fuel availability separately, we combine these critical parameters for a green transition of the shipping industry to show what it takes to reach sectoral emissions reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement. We utilize a least-cost optimization model drawing on data on, e.g., emissions with lifecycle elements and the costs of green fuel production. We find that reaching maritime reduction targets for a green transition requires high growth rates for green fuel availability, carbon pricing beyond 300EUR/tCO2eq, and at least 50% in fuel demand savings compared to today's demand projection for 2050. The results show the importance of immediate climate action if maritime emissions reduction goals are to be achieved. Â© 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - A resonant zero-voltage and zero-currentswitching (ZVZCS) dc-dc converter is proposed in this paper for a medium-voltage dc collection system of offshore wind farms. The resonant converter is composed of two full-bridge cells sharing a bridge leg, two transformers with uneven power ratings and different functions, whose secondary windings are connected in series and a voltagedoubler rectifier. The converter operates in discontinuous current mode and can achieve zero-current switching for four main power switches and rectifier diodes over the whole load range. The two auxiliary switches with small forward current can be turned on with ZVZCS, and turned off with zero-voltage switching. Hence, the switching loss can be reduced and efficiency is improved. The operation principle of the converter is analyzed and design rules of main parameters are presented. The influences of the turn ratios of auxiliary transformer and resonant capacitance on the peak and switching-off currents are discussed in detail. Furthermore, a model is built in PLECS and simulation results are given. A 150-1500 V/2 kW prototype is established and tested to verify the operation principle and design rules.

VL  - 138

AB  - Maritime transportation is a significant contributor to SOx, NOx, and particle matter (PM) emissions, and to a lesser extent, of CO2. Recently, new regulations are being enforced in special geographical areas to limit the amount of emissions from the ships. This fact, together with the high fuel prices, is driving the marine industry toward the improvement of the energy efficiency of ships. Although more sophisticated and complex engine designs can improve significantly of the energy systems on ships, waste heat recovery arises as the most effective technique for the reduction of the energy consumption. In this sense, it is estimated that around 50\% of the total energy from the fuel consumed in a ship is wasted and rejected through liquid and gas streams. The primary heat sources for waste heat recovery are the engine exhaust and coolant. In this work, we present a study on the integration of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) in an existing ship, for the recovery of the main and auxiliary engines (AE) exhaust heat. Experimental data from the engines on the cruise ship M/S Birka Stockholm were logged during a port-toport cruise from Stockholm to Mariehamn, over a period of 4 weeks. The ship has four main engines (ME) Wartsila 5850 kW for propulsion, and four AE 2760 kW which are used for electrical generation. Six engine load conditions were identified depending on the ship's speed. The speed range from 12 to 14 kn was considered as the design condition for the ORC, as it was present during more than 34\% of the time. In this study, the average values of the engines exhaust temperatures and mass flow rates, for each load case, were used as inputs for a model of an ORC. The main parameters of the ORC, including working fluid and turbine configuration, were optimized based on the criteria of maximum net power output and compactness of the installation components. Results from the study showed that an ORC with internal regeneration using benzene as working fluid would yield the greatest average net power output over the operating time. For this situation, the power production of the ORC would represent about 22\% of the total electricity consumption on board. These data confirmed the ORC as a feasible and promising technology for the reduction of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of existing ships.

AB  - In this paper, for a voltage source converter based multi-terminal DC transmission (VSC-MTDC) system connected with offshore wind farms, a self-adaptive and hierarchical control scheme was proposed to consider the optimal allocation of imbalanced power when wind energy fluctuation occurred frequently. The equivalent extra cost function in the form of active/reactive power and voltage on the valve side was deduced firstly in details. Based on the incremental cost curve of extra generation and DC voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC), the scheme can locally make the unbalanced power be shared economically without central controller, having similar effect to the equal increment principle (EIP). Principles of control parameters setting was discussed based on control characteristic analysis and stability analysis. Finally, a 4-terminal radial system was used to verify the effectiveness in PSCAD/EMTDC simulation platform. The results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the extra generation cost effectively under normal conditions, and maintain DC voltage stability and power balance when the fault occurs.

AB  - This paper deals with modelling of power fluctuations from large wind farms. The modelling is supported and validated using wind speed and power measurements from the two large offshore wind farms in Denmark. The time scale in focus is from 1 min to a couple of hours, where significant power fluctuations have been observed from these wind farms. Power and wind speed are measured with 1s sampling time in all individual wind turbines in almost 1 year, which provides a substantial database for the analyses. The paper deals with diversified models representing each wind turbine individually and with aggregation of a wind farm to be represented by a single large wind turbine model.

AB  - The authors have proposed, at ISOPE-2000, the unique machine in which two stage runners successfully counter-rotate the inner and outer rotors of the peculiar generator. This machine has remarkable advantages that not only output voltage is sufficient but also rotational moments hardly act on a mounting bed. These advantages make extremely easy to board the machine with large capacity on a floating buoy moored in the strait. In this paper, a semi-circular cylinder is proposed as the floating buoy type energy collector for giving effectively tidal current energy to the counter-rotating runners and flow conditions around its body are discussed with experimental data. Vortex behaviors shedding from its collector are also simulated numerically in comparison with visualized results.

AB  - Tidal current technologies have the potential to provide highly predictable energy, since tides are driven by lunar cycles. However, before implementing such technologies on a large scale, their environmental performance should be assessed. In this study, a prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed on a 12 MW tidal energy converter array of Minesto Deep Green 500 (DG500) prototypes, closely following the Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) standards, but including scenarios to cover various design possibilities. The global warming potential (GWP) of the prototype array was in the range of 18.4â€“26.3 gCO2-eq/kWhe. This is comparable with other renewable energy systems, such as wind power. Material production processes have the largest impact, but are largely offset by recycling at the end of life. Operation and maintenance processes, including the production of replacement parts, also provide major contributions to environmental impacts. Comparisons with other technologies are limited by the lack of a standardized way of performing LCA on offshore power generation technologies. Â© 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Large transoceanic ships use marine ancillary diesel engines for generating electricity, which, on the other hand, produce a remarkable amount of harmful emissions during the combustion process. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) establishes standards that limit the amount of harmful emissions produced during the engine combustion cycle in maritime transport. Because of this restriction, new alternative fuels entered the market. Experiments had been performed with various testing fuels created from biodiesel and ULSD-F (Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel-Fuel) in the ratios of 0\%, 50\%, 80\%, and 100\%. During the tests, the engine ran at different speeds and loads so that the mixed fuel influence on engine operation could be observed in detail and investigated.

AB  - This paper presents an offshore wind-wave hybrid generation (WWHG) system, which can efficiently harness the offshore wind and wave energy. The key is to use the multitoothed doubly-salient permanent-magnet (MDSPM) machines for serving the rotating generator and the linear generator. Different from the traditional wind or wave generation system, this WWHG system integrates the wind generation part and wave generation part together to directly harness the wind and wave energy without gear box. The system configuration and machine design are analyzed and discussed in detail. Also, the finite-element method is performed to verify the validity of the proposed two machine design. The results tell that the system has the high reliability and can be upgraded to the suitable size for offshore hybrid-source energy conversion in practical application.

AB  - Due to the increasingly competitive maritime market and stringent regulatory requirements, the optimization of ship energy efficiency is attracting more and more attention. The energy efficiency of ship navigation is affected by many factors such as ship structure, crew operation and navigation environment. In this paper, the proposed improved second-order oscillating PSO algorithm is used to study the ship energy efficiency from the viewpoint of route optimization by considering the sea conditions and constraints. Firstly, a nonlinear optimization model for ship FOC (fuel oil consumption) considering the time-varying sea state is established. On this basis, the energy efficiency and economic benefits are analyzed in terms of multiple indicators e.g., FOC and CO2 emissions per unit distance and per unit mass of freight. Finally, the energy saving potential of the method is demonstrated with an example of an oil tanker. The results show that both FOC and emissions are reduced after optimization, and energy efficiency and economy are improved by 1.17% and 2.55%, respectively. This indicated that the considerable effect of the proposed method applied to ship energy saving optimization. Â© 2022

AB  - The catenary mooring system is a well recognized station keeping method. However, there could be economical and environmental benefits of reducing the footprint. In the last decades, more focus has been given to synthetic mooring lines and different mooring layouts to optimize the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for offshore renevable energy converters such as wave energy converters. Therefore, this work presents a parametric study of two important parameters, namely the mooring line angle and line pretension, for a taut mooring configuration focusing on the dynamic response when applied to the TetraSpar floating foundation compared to a catenary mooring system. The work is based on experimental results conducted in the wave basin at Aalborg University (AAU) and compared to analytical stiffness calculations. In addition, a numerical model was tuned based on the main dynamics to achieve the tension response. The results showed satisfying dynamic behavior where the angle and pretension mainly influenced the surge and yaw natural periods. The motion response showed similar behavior between the chosen parameters, and larger pitch amplitudes were found compared to the catenary system.

AB  - Marine macroalgae or seaweeds are increasingly becoming strong candidates for sustainable biofuel feedstocks of the future. This study features a large-scale process design and comprehensive analysis of an industrial-scale (400,000 tons dry feedstock per year) poly-generation pyrolysis process that utilizes 3rd generation biofuel feedstock, Saccharina japonica brown seaweed, and produces diesel-range hydrocarbon fuel, heat, and power. Process design relied predominately on published experimental data regarding fast pyrolysis of S. japonica in a fixed-bed reactor system, followed by dewatering and catalytic upgrading of the produced biocrude. The design featured acid wash pretreatment for the reduction of mineral content, and subsequently a Rankine power cycle utilizing biochar. The design also considered two distinct cases of on-site hydrogen production and hydrogen purchase. Based on the experimental data, a rigorous steady-state flowsheet model was constructed using Aspen Plus for each design case. The results of comprehensive techno-economic assessment, sensitivity, and Monte Carlo analyses provided insight into capital cost for the process, minimum product selling price, and selling price ranges. Finally, the process is compared with traditional crude oil extraction and processing in terms of significant reductions in CO2 emissions, hence providing strong evidence of its environmental sustainability.

AB  - Ship owners and operators are looking for more efficient ships, with reduced emissions to air and water from all sources of pollution. To achieve this, ship designers need to look across all potential areas for improvements to the propulsion and manoeuvring systems, to the hull, and for all systems to be integrated. Rolls-Royce looks to the hull design as the starting point. The company cites its UT design, primarily applied to offshore vessels as an example of what can be achieved. The next step is to ensure that all parts of the ship - engines, propellers, control systems, maneuvering, navigation, cargo systems - work in harmony and, together, create an efficient machine. An actual example of an "integrated" ship, the 4400-dwt Bergen Star coastal tanker, was cited. The Nord Vest Consult 604PT design achieves a typical increase in cargo volume of 5-7% and improved course stability as well as improved fuel consumption and lower emissions. The biggest contribution to lower emissions comes from the choice of prime mover. The most obvious choice is a low-NOx diesel engine, like the Bergen B32-40E. For the future, Rolls-Royce is participating in the EU Felicitas marine fuel cells program, researching solid oxide fuel cells for marine applications.

AB  - Mangrove is one of the coastal vegetation that can act as carbon mitigation (carbon sink and carbon storage). This study aims to determine the potential for carbon sinks and storage in the leaves and roots of each type of mangrove found in Gili Meno lake, North Lombok, Indonesia. The research includes the identification of species and sampling (leaves and roots) of mangroves in the research quadrant. The organic carbon content of mangrove leaves and roots was tested using the Wakley and Black method. The results showed that there were 5 (five) types of mangroves in Gili Meno lake, namely: Avicennia marina, Lumnitzera racemosa, Bruguiera cylindrica, Rhizophora apiculata, and Excoecaria agallocha. The highest leaf tissue carbon content value was R. apiculata at 45.85%C or equivalent to 3.19 g.C, while in roots, A. marina was 50.06%C, equivalent to 4.49 g.C. In addition, the potential carbon stock in the leaves of the entire mangrove ecosystem in an area of 3 ha is 762.81 tons.CÂ±199.257 and at the roots is 659.76 tons.CÂ±394.848, while the largest potential carbon stock in leaf organs is the type of mangrove R. apiculata, which is 318.91 tons.C.ha-1. and at the root is the type of mangrove A. marina, amounting to 448.54 tons.C.ha-1. The estimated carbon dioxide uptake by the Gili Meno mangrove leaves is in the range of 130.36 g.CO2-168.27 g.CO2 or with an average of 154.34 g.CO2Â±14.376, while the species with the highest carbon dioxide absorption capacity is R. apiculata (268.27 g.CO2) and the lowest in the species of L. racemosa (130.36 g.CO2).

AB  - Ship emissions and coastal air pollution around China are expected to be alleviated with the gradual implementation of ship domestic emission control area (DECA) policies. However, a comprehensive post-assessment on the policy's effectiveness is still lacking. This study developed a series of high-spatiotemporal ship emission inventories around China from 2016 to 2019 based on an updated Ship Emission Inventory Model (SEIM v2.0) and analyzed the interannual changes in emissions under the influence of both ship activity increases and gradually promoted policies. In this model, NOx, SO2, PM and HC emissions from ships in China's inland rivers and the 200 Nm (nautical miles) coastal zone were estimated every day with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees based on a combination of automatic identification system (AIS) data and the Ship Technical Specifications Database (STSD). The route restoration technology and classification of ocean-going vessels (OGVs), coastal vessels (CVs) and river vessels (RVs) has greatly improved our model in the spatial distribution of ship emissions. From 2016 to 2019, SO2 and PM emissions from ships decreased by 29.6 \% and 26.4 \%, respectively, while ship NOx emissions increased by 13.0 \%. Although the DECA 1.0 policy was implemented in 2017, it was not until 2019 when DECA 2.0 came into effect that a significant emission reduction was achieved, e.g., a year-on-year decrease of 33.3 \%, regarding SO2. Considering the potential emissions brought by the continuous growth of maritime trade, however, an even larger SO2 emission reduction effect of 39.8 \% was achieved in these 4 years compared with the scenario without switching to cleaner fuel. Containers and bulk carriers are still the dominant contributors to ship emissions, and newly built, large ships and ships using clean fuel oil account for an increasingly large proportion of emission structures. A total of 4 years of consecutive daily ship emissions were presented for major ports, which reflects the influence of the step-by-step DECA policy on emissions in a timely manner and may provide useful references for port observation experiments and local policy making. In addition, the spatial distribution shows that a number of ships detoured outside the scope of DECA 2.0 in 2019, perhaps to save costs on more expensive low-sulfur oil, which would increase emissions in farther maritime areas. The multiyear ship emission inventory provides high-quality datasets for air-quality and dispersion modeling, as well as verifications for in situ observation experiments, which may also guide further ship emission control directions in China.

AB  - Progressing limits on pollutant emissions oblige ship owners to reduce the environmental impact of their operations. Fuel cells may provide a suitable solution, since they are fuel efficient while they emit few hazardous compounds. Various choices can be made with regard to the type of fuel cell system and logistic fuel, and it is unclear which have the best prospects for maritime application. An overview of fuel cell types and fuel processing equipment is presented, and maritime fuel cell application is reviewed with regard to efficiency, gravimetric and volumetric density, dynamic behaviour, environmental impact, safety and economics. It is shown that low temperature fuel cells using liquefied hydrogen provide a compact solution for ships with a refuelling interval up to a tens of hours, but may result in total system sizes up to five times larger than high temperature fuel cells and more energy dense fuels for vessels with longer mission requirements. The expanding infrastructure of liquefied natural gas and development state of natural gas-fuelled fuel cell systems can facilitate the introduction of gaseous fuels and fuel cells on ships. Fuel cell combined cycles, hybridisation with auxiliary electricity storage systems and redundancy improvements are identified as topics for further study. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon flux between an estuary and the ocean: A case for outwelling
JO  - Hydrobiologia
PY  - 1996
VL  - 337
IS  - 1-3
AB  - The classical outwelling hypothesis states that small coastal embayments (e.g. estuaries, wetlands) export their excess production to inshore marine waters. In line with this notion, the present study tested whether the Swartkops estuary acts as source or sink for carbon. To this end, concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were determined hourly during the first monthly spring and neap tides over one year in the tidal waters entering and leaving the estuary. Each sampling session spanned a full tidal cycle, yielding a total of 936 concentration estimates. Carbon fluxes were calculated by integrating concentrations with water flow rates derived from a hydrodynamic model calibrated for each sampling datum. Over the year, exports to marine waters markedly exceeded imports to the estuary for all carbon species: on the basis of total spring tidal drainage area, 1083 g m-2 of DIC, 103 g m-2 of DOC, and 123 g m-2 of POC left the estuary annually. Total carbon export from the estuary to the ocean amounted to 4755 tonnes, of which 83% was in the inorganic form (DIC). Thus, the bulk of carbon moving in the water column is inorganic - yet, DIC seems to be measured only rarely in most flux studies of this nature. Salt marshes cover extensive areas in this estuary and produce some carbon, particularly DOC, but productivity of the local Spartina species is low (P:B = 1.1). Consequently, the bulk of carbon exported from the estuary appears to originate from the highly productive macroinvertebrate and the phytoplankton component and not from the salt marsh plants.

AB  - The dynamics of single liquefied CO2 droplet released into the seawater to conduct the fundamental design for a new concept, COSMOS, was studied. This concept is proposed to contribute to sequestration and storage of CO2 in the deep part of the ocean for injecting liquefied CO2 droplets onto the sea bottom from an injection nozzle installed by an offshore floating system structure, as one of the options for mitigating the global warming effect. These CO2 droplets are made by a mixture of liquefied CO2 and dry ice at the CO2 triple point (0.52 MPa and 216.6 K), with density typically larger than that of the seawater. A numerical assessment to conduct the feasibility study by investigating fluid dynamics of liquefied CO2 in the turbulent seawater was presented. The effect of turbulence distorted the droplet very rapidly and violently, in particular under large gravitational effect.

TI  - Topology assessment for 3 + 3 terminal offshore DC grid considering DC fault management
JO  - Iet Generation, Transmission And Distribution
PY  - 2015
VL  - 9
IS  - 3
AB  - This study assesses four DC grid topologies where each of the terminals can exchange power with any other terminal and a DC fault on any DC cable can be isolated. The DC grids are built using the following components: hybrid DC circuit breakers (CB), mechanical DC CBs, DC/DC converters and DC hubs. The aim is to compare DC fault performance, technical feasibility/readiness, power transfer security, expansion and costs. The base case for comparison are three separate 300 km offshore HVDCs connecting 3 1 GW offshore wind farms with three onshore VSC terminals. The rating of DC CBs is limited by the state of technology and costs which introduces limitation on the length of DC cables (because of communication delays) and on the DC bus fault level (limiting the number of connecting DC lines). DC/DC converters inherently block propagation of DC faults and their rating is not sensitive to DC fault level. DC hubs have considerable cost advantages over multiple DC/DC converters in cases where multiple DC systems are connecting at the same DC station. The cost assumptions for all major components are analysed, including the offshore platform costs. The study concludes that overall DC grid costs are similar (within 8%) for all four topologies. Although power security is similar for all technologies, the expansion options are best with DC/DC converters or DC hubs. DC hubs nevertheless suffer from highest on-state losses.
