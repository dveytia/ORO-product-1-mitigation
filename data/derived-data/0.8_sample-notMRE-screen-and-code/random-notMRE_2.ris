TI  - Experimental influence of storm-surge salinity on soil greenhouse gas emissions from a tidal salt marsh
AB  - Storm surges can substantially alter the water level and salinity in tidal salt marshes. Little is known about how changes experienced during storm surges affect greenhouse gas emissions (GHG; CO2, CH4, N2O) from tidal salt marsh soils. Understanding how storm surges influence ecosystem processes is critical for evaluating the ecosystem's sensitivity to sea level rise. To explore how hurricane-induced changes in salinity affect GHG emissions, we exposed intact soil mesocosms (0â€“9 cm depth) from a Mid-Atlantic temperate salt marsh to pulse changes in salinity experienced at the site before, during, and after Hurricane Joaquin in 2015. Soil temperature, oxygen, and water level were kept constant to avoid confounding effects throughout the experiment. Automated measurements (hourly resolution) of soil GHG emissions were recorded in control (i.e., no salinity changes) and treatment mesocosms, and combined with soil pore water chemistry (i.e., SO4 2âˆ’, S2âˆ’, Fe2+, TNb, redox potential, pH) to characterize the biogeochemical responses. Using mixed effects models, we found that the role of different biogeochemical processes, such as sulfur cycling, changed throughout the experiment, underscoring the complex nature of GHG emissions in tidal salt marsh soils. Overall, soils subjected to a salinity decrease had greater GHG emissions than control soils, which were maintained at 17 ppt. The treatment soils had a 24% and 23% increase in global warming potential (20- and 100-year scenarios, respectively) indicating that storm surges can produce pulses of GHG emissions. However, both CH4 and N2O emissions returned to baseline values (following hysteresis responses) when initial conditions were reestablished. The results support the fact that tidal salt marshes are resilient ecosystems, as soil GHG emissions recovered relatively quickly from the pulse event. Â© 2019

TI  - Vortex-induced vibration effects of production risers in proximity with drilling risers or tendons
AB  - This paper examines the effects of ocean currents on the vortex-induced vibration response of deepwater tubulars, such as umbilicals, production risers, tendons, and drilling risers, in proximity. This issue has received very little attention by the industry yet potentially has substantial importance to the design of deepwater tubulars and platforms. Experiments have been conducted in a current flume on tandem flexible tubulars with diameter ratios of 2:1 and 4:1. The smaller diameter tubular was placed in both the upstream and downstream positions, with the top and bottom locations spaced apart at three different distances. The tension was kept constant, but the current speed was varied. While both uniform flow and sheared flow tests were conducted, only the uniform flow tests are reported herein. The response modes varied from about 1-6, so that they were sufficiently high to easily allow both single mode and multiple mode responses, of which both were prevalent throughout the testing program. While all of the tests were conducted at low Reynolds numbers, the results can be thoughtfully translated to most field applications. The results describe the vibration and response characteristics of both the upstream and downstream tubulars for various configurations that were tested. Since a myriad of diameter ratios, separation distances, and flow velocities are possible with tubulars in the field, these tests have attempted to provide general insights into the responses of tandem tubulars with unequal diameters and, in some cases, offer guidance on limitations to the responses that can be used for offshore field designs.

TI  - Technical and economical comparison of subsea active heating technologies
AB  - Active heating of subsea flowlines is an attractive solution for addressing flow assurance challenges related to going always deeper and further, as well as facing more complex fluids and critical wellhead flowing conditions (pressure, temperature, flowrate) prone to pour point issues, hydrates and/or wax appearance risk. Over the last 15 years, several active heating technologies have been developed and operated in order to significantly help solve flow assurance issues from the subsea wellheads up to the surface support facilities. These technologies have demonstrated to be very different in their design and operability (use of hot water, direct or indirect electrical heating) but also in their efficiency and cost. In parallel with the development of the IPB (Integrated Production Bundle) heated flexible pipe already used for field development in West Africa and Brazil as well as a rigid heated pipe-in-pipe technology, both using electrical heat trace cables, Technip has been involved in the design, construction and installation of several projects using active heating technologies. Based on this extensive knowledge and track-record, this paper describes and compares the working principle as well as the advantages and drawbacks of the different active heating technologies. This paper also identifies their limitations with regards to field application, i.e. reach out length and water depth based on their present development status. On the basis of different generic case studies (shallow long tie-back, shallow in-field development, deep water tie-back and ultra-deep water in-field development), this paper finally reviews all the potential benefits the different active heating technologies can bring to a project and includes an economical comparison of these technologies.

TI  - Open hole formation testing and sampling in shallow and low pressure gas reservoirs: Best practices and lessons learned
AB  - Cendor Graben Shallow sands are 35 Km2 of gas accumulation at depth varying from 350-450mss over the Jambu-Liang anticline, defined by high amplitude in seismic, containing hydrocarbon gas (C1-C3 gas indicated by mudlogs) with the possibility of high CO2, possibly charged from deeper sources through fault seeps. Low pressure gas reservoirs present unique measurement and operations challenges to the wireline formation tester (WFT) in pretesting and sampling due to compressibility. Often the high gas compressibility results in a larger pretest drawdown volume needed to decompress the flowline and to reduce the flowline pressure below the formation pressure for a valid formation pressure measurement. High mobility lithofacies further complicates the flowline decompression due to a very small pressure drawdown. In addition, at the start of pretest build-up period, a pressure build-down behavior was observed and has greatly affected the formation pressure stabilization and mobility calculation. On the other hand, gas sampling in such low pressure and unconsolidated formation introduces great difficulties in balancing the samples bottle filling and sand production initiation which may potentially plug the downhole pump-out module. The station time limitation commonly imposed by the drillers make the sampling process even more challenging. In the past, companies often considered these sands as drilling hazards and not targets for exploration. This testing validated the importance of formation testing in shallow unconsolidated gas reservoirs by preventing formation failure that could lead to plugging. The small sand particle sizes and unconsolidated nature of the formation make it very difficult to control sand production. This work presents an exploration work done in a very shallow and low pressure gas bearing formation, which exposes the WFT to a combination of unconsolidated formation and high gas compressibility challenges. Best practices are established and discussed in this paper to address the aforementioned challenges to enable a successful WFT evaluation in the shallow, low pressure gas reservoirs.

TI  - Decadal fCO(2) trends in global ocean margins and adjacent boundary current-influenced areas
AB  - Determination of the rate of change of sea surface CO2 fugacity (fCO(2)) is important, as the fCO(2) gradient between the atmosphere and the ocean determines the direction of CO2 flux and hence the fate of this greenhouse gas. Using a newly available, community-based global CO2 database (Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas Version 3 coastal data set) and a newly developed statistical method, we report that the global ocean margins (within 400km offshore, 30 degrees S-70 degrees N) fCO(2) temporal trends on decadal time scales (1.931.59atmyr(-1)) closely follow the atmospheric fCO(2) increase rate (1.900.06atmyr(-1)) in the Northern Hemisphere but are lower (1.350.55atmyr(-1)) in the Southern Hemisphere, reflecting dominant atmospheric forcing in conjunction with different warming rates in the two hemispheres. In addition to the atmospheric fCO(2) forcing, a direct warming effect contributes more to fCO(2) increase in the western boundary current-influenced areas, while intensified upwelling contributes more to fCO(2) increase in eastern boundary current-influenced areas.

TI  - Biodiesel as alternative fuel for marine diesel engine applications: A review
AB  - Transportation and shipping activities are major contributor to air pollution at sea where most of it occurs as a result of exhaust emissions from ships. Stringent emission limitations enforced by the International Maritime Organization have hastened the need to find a new alternative fuel for marine diesel engines. Thus, biodiesel fuel was chosen as one of the environmentally friendly alternative energy that can reduce ship toxic gas emissions and at the same time reduces dependence on petroleum-based fuels. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of biodiesel as an alternative fuel for marine diesel engine applications. This review covers the biodiesel fuel background, engine performance, history, recent progress, engine warranty, issues, challenges, and possible solutions on using biodiesel for marine applications. A significant number of literatures from indexed journals were cited accordingly. The results of previous studies had shown that the use of biodiesel would mostly increase the amount of brake specific fuel consumption and nitrogen oxide gas while conversely reducing other toxic gas emissions. Although a number of issues and challenges arise, most marine engine manufacturers give conditional warranty against the use of biodiesel in the engines. The study concluded that biodiesel and its blends have a bright future in the marine sector, provided some of the highlighted issues can be solved. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Potential of offshore wind energy for direct air capture
AB  - The world is setting aggressive targets for climate change mitigation and most pathway models require negative emission technologies (NETs) to meet these targets. Direct air capture (DAC) is a promising NET that captures carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmospheric air; however, indirect and embodied emissions to power and build DAC systems must be considered when exploring NET options. Wind energy has experienced rapid cost reductions in the past few years and experts predict a significant continued decline in offshore wind energy costs. Here, we develop a conceptual design and conduct an energy assessment of two dominating DAC designs to show the potential of offshore wind to meet the DAC energy demand for two different scenarios capturing 3.3 GtCO2/y (10%) and 11 GtCO2/y (33.3%) of current global CO2 emissions covering a range of estimates for future NETs required to meet net-zero goals. Energy assessment showed that the estimated energy requirement for the Carbon Engineering based design is higher as compared with Climeworks based design owing to the high temperature (900Â°C) requirement in the calcination step required for the desorption of CO2. However, conceptual design revealed that area requirements for DAC configurations are much less for Carbon Engineering based design comparatively. Employing offshore wind energy can eliminate indirect emissions associated with meeting DAC energy demands, facilitative modular NET deployment globally, be positioned geographically to avoid competition with grid decarbonization and take advantage of otherwise stranded offshore wind resources. Large-scale offshore wind energy integrated DAC systems, therefore, deserve development efforts and deployment alongside other mitigation and NET options. Â© 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Bacterial community responses during a possible CO2 leaking from sub-seabed storage in marine polluted sediments
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a viable option to reduce high concentrations of CO2 and mitigate their negative effects. This option has associated risks such as possible CO2 leakage from the storage sites. So far, negative effects deriving from a CO2 release have been reported for benthic macrofauna in both polluted and nonpolluted sediments. However, bacterial communities has no considered. In this work, risk assessment was carried out in order to evaluate the possible effects in a contaminated area considering bacterial responses (total number of cells, respiring activity, changes in the bacterial community composition and diversity). Four microcosms were placed into an integrated CO2 injection system with a non-pressurized chamber to simulate four different pH treatments (pH control 7.8, 7, 6.5 and 6). Results showed an impact on bacterial communities because of the CO2 treatment. Changes in respiring activity, community composition groups and diversity were found. This study highlights the use of respiring bacteria activity not only as bioindicator for environmental risk assessment and monitoring purposes but also as a bioindicador during a CO2 leakage event or CO2 enrichment process among all the responses studied.

TI  - Nutrients that limit growth in the ocean
AB  - Phytoplankton form the basis of the marine food web and are responsible for approximately half of global carbon dioxide (CO2) fixation (âˆ¼ 50 Pg of carbon per year). Thus, these microscopic, photosynthetic organisms are vital in controlling the atmospheric CO2 concentration and Earth's climate. Phytoplankton are dependent on sunlight and their CO2-fixation activity is therefore restricted to the upper, sunlit surface ocean (that is, the euphotic zone). CO2 usually does not limit phytoplankton growth due to its high concentration in seawater. However, the vast majority of oceanic surface waters are depleted in inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, iron and/or silica; nutrients that limit primary production in the ocean (Figure 1). Phytoplankton growth is mainly supported by either the recycling of nutrients or by reintroduction of nutrients from deeper waters by mixing. A small percentage of primary production, though, is fueled by â€˜externalâ€™ or â€˜newâ€™ nutrients and it is these nutrients that determine the amount of carbon that can be sequestered long term in the deep ocean. For most nutrients such as phosphorus, iron, and silica, the external supply is limited to atmospheric deposition and/or coastal and riverine inputs, whereas their main sink is the sedimentation of particulate matter. Nitrogen, however, has an additional, biological source, the fixation of N2 gas, as well as biological sinks via the processes of denitrification and anammox. Despite the comparatively small contributions to the overall turnover of nutrients in the ocean, it is these biological processes that determine the ocean's capacity to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere on time scales of ocean circulation (âˆ¼ 1000 years). This primer will highlight shifts in the traditional paradigms of nutrient limitation in the ocean, with a focus on the uniqueness of the nitrogen cycling and its biological sources and sinks.

TI  - The cost of carbon capture and storage in the Perth region
AB  - This paper describes and reports the results of analyses of the costs of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage in southwest Western Australia. We analyze the costs of capturing approximately 22 million tonnes per year of CO2 and injecting it into one of three storage sites: the Gage sandstone offshore Perth, the Dongara depleted gas field, and the Neocomian subcrop offshore Geraldton. The central estimates obtained are that the real cost to capture, transport, and inject CO2 for a period of 25 years is between 59 and 63 Australian dollars (AUD) per tonne of CO2 avoided (in 2005 terms), depending on the location of the injection site. The sensitivity of these cost estimates to changes in key assumptions is also analyzed. These sensitivity analyses show that the costs of carbon capture and storage (CCS) can vary significantly with different assumptions for key variables.

TI  - Cathodic protection design considerations for offshore structures in the arctic environment
AB  - The Arctic imposes unique challenges for design of cathodic protection (CP) systems for offshore structures. These include alternative structure designs, and environmental factors such as pack ice, high water resistivity, extreme tidal velocities and amplitudes, and severe weather. Traditional approaches to CP design for offshore structures are typically not suitable for service in Arctic conditions. Adaptations include almost exclusive use of impressed current or hybrid CP systems, versus traditional sacrificial anode designs, specialized anode deployment and cabling systems, and design of CP monitoring equipment suitable for Arctic conditions. The effect of Arctic conditions on CP current requirement, anode current output, anode material selection, anode configuration, cabling systems and power supplies is discussed. Case histories of specialized CP designs for offshore structures in the Russian Arctic and Cook Inlet are presented. These case histories include relevant CP design, construction, installation and operating details. Copyright 2011, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Expanding well design
AB  - Solid expandable tubulars continue to help mitigate the risks and challenges associated with offshore drilling. Eventure Global Technology has performed 34 installations with an expandable shoe set below 20,000ft. Additionally, expandable liners have been used on rigs water depths in excess of 7000ft and in wellbores with temperatures nearing 400Â°F. Over the past decade, solid expandable systems have been enhanced to offer better drill-out, more robust connections and increased burst and collapse rating. A 2006 upgrade to the expansion tool dramatically reduced the amount of material drilled out after expansion. An application that offers the most value almost always is associated with close collaboration between the expandable service provider and the operator's reservoir engineering and drilling departments. This allows both parties to evaluate the best solution for maximizing return on investment and long-term sustainability of the reservoir.

TI  - Role of vegetated coastal ecosystems as nitrogen and phosphorous filters and sinks in the coasts of Saudi Arabia
AB  - Vegetated coastal ecosystems along the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf coasts of Saudi Arabia thrive in an extremely arid and oligotrophic environment, with high seawater temperatures and salinity. Mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh ecosystems have been shown to act as efficient sinks of sediment organic carbon, earning these vegetated ecosystems the moniker 'blue carbon' ecosystems. However, their role as nitrogen and phosphorus (N and P) sinks remains poorly understood. In this study, we examine the capacity of blue carbon ecosystems to trap and store nitrogen and phosphorous in their sediments in the central Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. We estimated the N and P stocks (in 0.2 m thick-sediments) and accumulation rates (for the last century based on 210Pb and for the last millennia based on 14C) in mangrove, seagrass and saltmarsh sediments from eight locations along the coast of Saudi Arabia (81 cores in total). The N and P stocks contained in the top 20 cm sediments ranged from 61 g N m-2 in Red Sea seagrass to 265 g N m-2 in the Gulf saltmarshes and from 70 g P m-2 in Red Sea seagrass meadows and mangroves to 58 g P m-2 in the Gulf saltmarshes. The short-term N and P accumulation rates ranged from 0.09 mg N cm-2 yr-1 in Red Sea seagrass to 0.38 mg N cm-2 yr-1 in Gulf mangrove, and from 0.027 mg P cm-2 yr-1 in the Gulf seagrass to 0.092 mg P cm-2 yr-1 in Red Sea mangroves. Short-term N and P accumulation rates were up to 10-fold higher than long-term accumulation rates, highlighting increasing sequestration of N and P over the past century, likely due to anthropogenic activities such as coastal development and wastewater inputs.

TI  - A validated and accurate method for quantifying and extrapolating mangrove aboveâ€ground biomass using lidar data
AB  - LiDAR data and derived canopy height models can provide useful information about mangrove tree heights that assist with quantifying mangrove aboveâ€ground biomass. This study presents a validated method for quantifying mangrove heights using LiDAR data and calibrating this against plotâ€based estimates of aboveâ€ground biomass. This approach was initially validated for the mangroves of Darwin Harbour, in Northern Australia, which are structurally complex and have high species diversity. Established relationships were then extrapolated to the nearby West Alligator River, which provided the opportunity to quantify biomass at a remote location where intensive fieldwork was limited. Relationships between LiDARâ€derived mangrove heights and mean tree height per plot were highly robust for Ceriops tagal, Rhizophora stylosa and Sonneratia alba (r2 = 0.84â€“0.94, RMSE = 0.03â€“ 0.91 m; RMSE% = 0.07%â€“11.27%), and validated well against an independent dataset. Additionally, relationships between the derived canopy height model and fieldâ€based estimates of aboveâ€ground biomass were also robust and validated (r2 = 0.73â€“0.90, RMSE = 141.4 kgâ€“1098.58 kg, RMSE% of 22.94â€“ 39.31%). Speciesâ€specific estimates of tree density per plot were applied in order to align biomass of individual trees with the resolution of the canopy height model. The total aboveâ€ground biomass at Darwin Harbour was estimated at 120 t haâˆ’1 and comparisons with prior estimates of mangrove above-ground biomass confirmed the accuracy of this assessment. To establish whether accurate and validated relationships could be extrapolated elsewhere, the established relationships were applied to a LiDARâ€derived canopy height model at nearby West Alligator River. Aboveâ€ground biomass derived from extrapolated relationships was estimated at 206 t haâˆ’1, which compared well with prior biomass estimates, confirming that this approach can be extrapolated to remote locations, providing the mangrove forests are biogeographically similar. The validated method presented in this study can be used for reporting mangrove carbon storage under national obligations, and is useful for quantifying carbon within various markets.

TI  - Li-ion batteries for energy storage and hybrid power: Safety and suitability considerations for offshore applications
AB  - With new battery technologies available and impending emissions control areas (ECA) in the US continental shelf, and NOx enforcement mechanisms in the North Sea and elsewhere, there is a need to reduce emissions and improve efficiency of oil and gas exploration and production. It has been stated that ECA regulations will require NOx reductions by 80% by 2020. This reduction can be achieved in part with hybrid power systems. In addition, the movement toward subsea systems will introduce new power requirements. Transmission to ultra deepwater assets will be costly, and a need to downsize transmission lines and cables can be met with subsea battery systems which buffer transients and reduce the maximum capacity for cables. The challenge that the oil and gas industry faces is to decide when and where hybrid power systems provide the most value for operations, how they should be implemented, what technologies are acceptable, what safety considerations there may be, and how these technologies can improve the bottom line. There is a wealth of information on lithium ion batteries though it is not all consistent; cost data is unclear, lifetime and energy density considerations vary under different conditions, and ruggedness and application to harsh environments is a large uncertainty.

AB  - The SOE annual conference for 2006 which was titled 'Fuel Emissions &amp; the Environment- Sustaining the Future' discussed several issues related to practical and financial options for the energy supply. The Sustainable Development Commission (SDC) is expecting to achieve progress in terms of decentralized energy system using waste heat, expansion of diverse range of renewables, micro generation and reducing emissions from transport. It was noted that the ocean power delivery (OPD) has delivered three 750 kW 'Pelamis' wave power generators to Portugal at a price of Â£8.1million which was its first order for a wave farm.

TI  - An experimental study of gas solubility in glycerin based drilling fluid applied to well control
AB  - The drilling fluid is the primary barrier element against a kick. In the path of drilling fluids evolution, syntheticbased drilling fluid (SBDF) is commonly used on offshore rigs due to its benefits to the high level of drilling complexity, especially at deep and ultra-deep-water scenarios. However, when formation gas dissolves in the mud due to high pressure and high temperature, the complexity of kick detection increases significantly. Furthermore, environmental concerns raised a red flag on SBDF usage due to potential impacts on the marine environment, with most governmental agencies around the world passing very strict regulations. Considering both aspects - safety, and environmental concerns - glycerin emerges as a potential candidate to perform a key role as a base drilling fluid (GBDF). At first, a GBDF has the potential to behave as an SBDF due to its benefits, such as lubricity and shale stabilization, and, at the same time, it has the same characteristics of water-based drilling fluid (WBDF) with very low methane solubility, the major component of natural gas. Additionally, GBDF is considered to be more environmentally friendly than SBDF. In this work, we first analyzed the PVT properties and rheology of three different molar composition glycerin-based drilling fluids: 100\% glycerin, 5050\% glycerin/brine, and 40-60\% glycerin/brine. Then, we performed the PVT properties analysis of methane (10-50\% molar mass) mixed with each of these GBDF mentioned. In a systematic constant composition expansion through a visual high-resolution PVT cell under temperature and pressure range conditions of 20-80 degrees C and 0-55 MPa, respectively, and rheology characterization. The GBDF exhibited interesting results for density and rheology parameters similar to an SDBF and no methane solubility. Finally, mathematical correlations are proposed and applied to illustrate a pit-gain calculation comparing to an n-paraffin-based drilling fluid.

TI  - Future ocean acidification will be amplified by hypoxia in coastal habitats
AB  - Ocean acidification is elicited by anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions and resulting oceanic uptake of excess CO2 and might constitute an abiotic stressor powerful enough to alter marine ecosystem structures. For surface waters in gas-exchange equilibrium with the atmosphere, models suggest increases in CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) from current values of ca. 390 mu atm to ca. 700-1,000 mu atm by the end of the century. However, in typically unequilibrated coastal hypoxic regions, much higher pCO(2) values can be expected, as heterotrophic degradation of organic material is necessarily related to the production of CO2 (i.e., dissolved inorganic carbon). Here, we provide data and estimates that, even under current conditions, maximum pCO(2) values of 1,700-3,200 mu atm can easily be reached when all oxygen is consumed at salinities between 35 and 20, respectively. Due to the nonlinear nature of the carbonate system, the approximate doubling of seawater pCO(2) in surface waters due to ocean acidification will most strongly affect coastal hypoxic zones as pCO(2) during hypoxia will increase proportionally: we calculate maximum pCO(2) values of ca. 4,500 mu atm at a salinity of 20 (T = 10 A degrees C) and ca. 3,400 mu atm at a salinity of 35 (T = 10 A degrees C) when all oxygen is consumed. Upwelling processes can bring these CO2-enriched waters in contact with shallow water ecosystems and may then affect species performance there as well. We conclude that (1) combined stressor experiments (pCO(2) and pO(2)) are largely missing at the moment and that (2) coastal ocean acidification experimental designs need to be closely adjusted to carbonate system variability within the specific habitat. In general, the worldwide spread of coastal hypoxic zones also simultaneously is a spread of CO2-enriched zones. The magnitude of expected changes in pCO(2) in these regions indicates that coastal systems may be more endangered by future global climate change than previously thought.

TI  - International news: Eyeing the risks of new rewards
AB  - UK-based Energy Institute (EI) have raked the potential dangers of carbon capture and storage (CCS). Most of the work looked at offshore platforms from which CO2 could be injected into undersea rock formations, and the pipelines that connect them to onshore plants where the greenhouse gas is initially captured. Their analysis is based around models of low-probability high-impact accidents, developed by the UK's Health and Safety Laboratory. They looked at how CO2 would disperse should it be released in high volumes, and how this could impact people on the platform, and ships or rescue vessels responding to a distress call. EI aims to provide a useful example from which individuals could develop further hazard models and set out potential solutions and mitigation techniques.

TI  - Feasibility Analysis of Standalone Hybrid Renewable Energy System for Kiltan Island in India
AB  - The net present cost (NPC) and the cost of energy (COE) are very high in the remote islands because energy is mainly generated from diesel generators. Pollution is also increasing due to the usage of diesel generators. So, the objective in this work is to minimize the NPC, COE, and pollution by using renewable energy sources such as solar and wind in addition to diesel. Kiltan Island of Union Territory of Lakshadweep in India has been considered for the study. The average wind speed and average daily radiation at Kiltan Island are 5.51Â m/s and 5.76 kWh/m2/day respectively. The modeling, simulation, and optimization have been performed by Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software. The model that gives an optimal solution includes Diesel-PV-Battery. This model gives the least NPC and COE. For sensitivity analysis, the wind speed (m/s) and the fuel rate ($) have been considered as sensitivity variables. The optimal system is obtained for the sensitivity variable of 5.21Â m/s of wind speed and 1$/L of diesel price. This optimal system also reduces pollution by 90%.

TI  - Time series pCO(2) at a coastal mooring: Internal consistency, seasonal cycles, and interannual variability
AB  - Marine carbonate system monitoring programs often consist of multiple observational methods that include underway cruise data, moored autonomous time series, and discrete water bottle samples. Monitored parameters include all, or some of the following: partial pressure of CO2 of the water (pCO(2w)) and air, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), and pH. Any combination of at least two of the aforementioned parameters can be used to calculate,the others. In this study at the Gray's Reef (GR) mooring in the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) we: examine the internal consistency of pCO(2), from underway cruise, moored autonomous time series, and calculated from bottle samples (DIC-TA pairing); describe the seasonal to interannual pCO(2w) time series variability and air-sea flux (FCO2), as well as describe the potential sources of pCO(2w) variability; and determine the source/sink for atmospheric pCO(2). Over the-8.5 years of GR mooring time series, mooring-underway and mooring-bottle calculated pCO2w strongly correlate with r-values > 0.90. pCO(2w) and FCO2 time series follow seasonal thermal patterns; however, seasonal non-thermal processes, such as terrestrial export, net biological production, and air-sea exchange also influence variability. The linear slope of time series pCO(2w) increases by 5.2 +/- 1.4 atm y(-1) with FCO2 increasing 51-70 mmol m(-2) y(-1). The net FCO2 sign can switch interannually with the magnitude varying greatly. Non-thermal pCO(2w) is also increasing over the time series, likely indicating that terrestrial export and net biological processes drive the long term pCO(2w) increase.

TI  - CO2 storage capacity estimates for selected regions of China - Results from the China-UK Near Zero Emissions Coal (NZEC) initiative
AB  - 3E Research Centre, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, PRC This paper presents an overview of some recent CO2 storage capacity assessments in the Songliao and Subei Basins in China, and a discussion of some of the specific challenges that must be addressed to further assess the feasibility of CO2 storage in China. Geological CO2 storage associated with CO2-EOR is of significant interest in these basins as it offers potential to increase oil production and provide additional fuel to meet China's increasing energy consumption. Although some CO2 is stored during such flooding projects, the greatest storage potential is only realised at the end of a field's productive life, when a depleted field can be used as a dedicated CO2 storage reservoir. The Songliao Basin, in North-eastern China has been the largest oil and gas producing province in China. The oilfields of the Daqing and Jilin oil provinces are estimated to have effective CO2 storage capacities of 593 Mt and 71.2 Mt respectively. Extrapolation of data from around the oilfields to the whole basin suggests that the most promising saline aquifer in the basin has a theoretical storage capacity of 692 Mt CO2: its effective storage capacity (which cannot be estimated due to lack of data) is likely to be considerably smaller however. Limited data availability means the estimate of storage capacity in this saline aquifer is based on gross simplifications and extrapolation across large areas (e.g. basin-scale) but could provide a basis for comparison with the potential for CO2 storage in other regions in China, or to help prioritise more detailed analysis. Although smaller, the onshore oilfields of the Subei-Yellow Sea Basin were also assessed, as the presence of mature oil and gas fields and natural CO2 accumulations, suggest suitable targets for storage may be found. The total effective storage capacity of the 108 hydrocarbon fields in this basin are estimated to be only 21 Mt CO2. While small, these fields may offer niche storage options for smaller industrial CO2 sources, but if CCS is to contribute to reducing China's growing CO2 emissions, then further evaluation and development of storage in saline aquifers is likely to be needed at the same time as storage in oil or gas fields.

TI  - On physical mechanisms enhancing air-sea CO2 exchange
AB  - Reducing uncertainties in the air-sea CO2 flux calculations is one of the major challenges when addressing the oceanic contribution in the global carbon balance. In traditional models, the air-sea CO2 flux is estimated using expressions of the gas transfer velocity as a function of wind speed. However, other mechanisms affecting the variability in the flux at local and regional scales are still poorly understood. The uncertainties associated with the flux estimates become particularly large in heterogeneous environments such as coastal and marginal seas. Here, we investigated the air-sea CO2 exchange at a coastal site in the central Baltic Sea using 9 years of eddy covariance measurements. Based on these observations we were able to capture the temporal variability in the air-sea CO2 flux and other parameters relevant for the gas exchange. Our results show that a wind-based model with a similar pattern to those developed for larger basins and open-sea conditions can, on average, be a good approximation for k, the gas transfer velocity. However, in order to reduce the uncertainty associated with these averages and produce reliable short-term k estimates, additional physical processes must be considered. Using a normalized gas transfer velocity, we identified conditions associated with enhanced exchange (large k values). During high and intermediate wind speeds (above 6-8 ms(-1)), conditions on both sides of the air-water interface were found to be relevant for the gas exchange. Our findings further suggest that at such relatively high wind speeds, sea spray is an efficient mechanisms for air-sea CO2 exchange. During low wind speeds (< 6 ms(-1)), water-side convection was found to be a relevant control mechanism. The effect of both sea spray and water-side convection on the gas exchange showed a clear seasonality with positive fluxes (winter conditions) being the most affected.

TI  - Functional impacts of ocean acidification in an ecologically critical foundation species
AB  - Anthropogenic CO2 is reducing the pH and altering the carbonate chemistry of seawater, with repercussions for marine organisms and ecosystems. Current research suggests that calcification will decrease in many species, but compelling evidence of impaired functional performance of calcium carbonate structures is sparse, particularly in key species. Here we demonstrate that ocean acidification markedly degrades the mechanical integrity of larval shells in the mussel Mytilus californianus, a critical community member on rocky shores throughout the northeastern Pacific. Larvae cultured in seawater containing CO2 concentrations expected by the year 2100 (540 or 970ppm) precipitated weaker, thinner and smaller shells than individuals raised under present-day seawater conditions (380ppm), and also exhibited lower tissue mass. Under a scenario where mussel larvae exposed to different CO2 levels develop at similar rates, these trends suggest a suite of potential consequences, including an exacerbated vulnerability of new settlers to crushing and drilling attacks by predators; poorer larval condition, causing increased energetic stress during metamorphosis; and greater risks from desiccation at low tide due to shifts in shell area to body mass ratios. Under an alternative scenario where responses derive exclusively from slowed development, with impacted individuals reaching identical milestones in shell strength and size by settlement, a lengthened larval phase could increase exposure to high planktonic mortality rates. In either case, because early life stages operate as population bottlenecks, driving general patterns of distribution and abundance, the ecological success of this vital species may be tied to how ocean acidification proceeds in coming decades.

TI  - A comparative environmental assessment of heat pumps and gas boilers towards a circular economy in the ukâ€ 
AB  - This research compares the potential environmental impacts of heat pumps with gas boilers and scenario analysis through utilising the life cycle approach. The study analyses the current situation with the baseline model and assesses future applications with Circular Economy (CE), Resource Efficiency (RE) and Limited Growth (LG) scenarios. Then, hybrid applications of low-carbon technologies and different manufacturing scenarios are investigated according to baseline and CE scenarios. Our results show that the use and manufacturing phases are responsible for 74% and 14% of all environmental impacts on average as expected. Even though the electricity mix of the UK has decarbonised substantially during the last decade, heat pumps still have higher lifetime impacts than gas boilers in all environmental categories except climate change impact. The carbon intensity of heat pumps is much lower than gas boilers with 0.111 and 0.097 kg CO2e for air source heat pumps and ground source heat pumps, whereas the boiler stands as 0.241 kg CO2e. Future scenarios offer significant reductions in most of the impact categories. The CE scenario has the highest potential with a 44% reduction for heat pumps and 27% for gas boilers on average. RE and LG scenarios have smaller potential than the CE scenario, relatively. However, several categories expect an increase in future scenarios such as freshwater ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity and metal depletion categories. High deployment of offshore wind farms will have a negative impact on these categories; therefore, a comprehensive approach through a market introduction programme should be provided at the beginning before shifting from one technology to another. The 50% Hybrid scenario results expect a reduction of 24% and 20% on average for ASHP and GSHP, respectively, in the baseline model. The reduction is much lower in the CE scenario, with only a 2% decrease for both heat pumps because of the reduction in heat demand in the future. These results emphasise that even though the importance of the use phase is significant in the baseline model, the remaining phases will play an important role to achieve Net-Zero targets in the future.

TI  - Organic carbon deliveries and their flow related dynamics in the Fitzroy estuary
AB  - The Fitzroy estuary (Queensland, Australia) receives large, but highly episodic, river flows from a catchment (144,000 km2) which has undergone major land clearing. Large quantities of suspended sediments, and particulate and dissolved organic carbon are delivered. At peak flows, Î´13C (-21.7 Â± 0.8â€°) and C/N (14.8 Â± 1.3) of the suspended solids indicate that the particulate organic material entering the estuary is principally soil organic carbon. At the lower beginning flows the particulate organic matter comes from in-stream producers (Î´ 13C = -26â€°). The DOC load is about 10 times the POC load. Using the inverse method, budgets for POC and DOC were constructed for high and low flows. Under high flows, only a small portion of the POC and DOC load is lost in the estuary. Under dry season (low flow) conditions the estuary is a sink for DOC, but remains a source of POC to the coastal waters. Crown Copyright Â© 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A review of treatment technologies for produced water in offshore oil and gas fields
AB  - Offshore oil and gas production is increasingly growing popular globally. Produced water (PW), which is the largest byproduct of oil and gas production, is a complex mixture of dissolved and undissolved organic and inorganic substances. PW contributes considerably to oil pollution in the offshore petroleum and gas industry owing to the organic substances, which mainly include hydrocarbons; this is a major concern to researchers because of the long-term adverse effects on the ecosystem. Since the development of offshore petroleum and gas industry, the PW treatment process has been classified into pretreatment, standard-reaching treatment, and advanced purification treatment based on the characteristics of PW and has been coupled with the environmental, economic, and regulatory considerations. The mechanism, design principle, application, and development of conventional technologies for PW treatment, such as gravity and enhanced gravity sedimentation, hydrocyclone, gas flotation, and medium filtration, are summarized in this study. Novel methods for further application, such as tubular separation, combined fibers coalescence, and membrane separation, are also discussed. Enhancement of treatment with multiple physical fields and environmentally friendly chemical agents, coupled with information control technology, would be the preferred PW treatment approach in the future. Moreover, the PW treatment system should be green, efficient, secure, and intelligent to satisfy the large-scale, unmanned, and abyssal exploration of offshore oil and gas production in the future.

TI  - Potentials of postharvest rice crop residues as a source of biofuel
AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a common crop in the scenario of Southeast Asia and specifically in the coastal regions. The disposal of postharvest rice crop residues by the farmers in between the two successive cropping seasons in the conventional pattern has many dire consequences such as troublesome, uneconomical, and the possibility of increasing the agricultural waste load in the environment. The present approach of generation of biofuel from postharvest rice crop residues is a possible step toward generation of renewable energy source to improve the prevailing status of energy demand. The environmental degradation and energy crisis related to the current trend of increase in daily consumption levels are burning problems at the global front. The generation of biofuel from postharvest rice crop residues makes effective utilization of these residues and could supplement the sustained energy pool. To face this challenge, it requires the optimization of the operating conditions and the process of generation of biofuel in the pilot scale. Increasing the biofuel productivity needs the application of technology based on investment, which is possible on the part of a marginal farmer to afford. The successful operation of the pilot project and the field-scale application could help the farmers in utilizing the harnessed energy to meet their daily energy requirements. It is a step toward improvisation of the socioeconomic condition of the farmers and to reduce the waste load from the agricultural system. Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Exploitation of trans-Arctic maritime transportation
AB  - Due to global warming, the quantity of Arctic sea ice has been drastically reduced in recent decades, consequently navigating the Arctic is becoming increasingly commercially feasible during part of the year. It will bring huge transportation benefits due to reduction in navigational time, fossil energy consumption and related carbon emissions. In this article, the authors comprehensively assessed the exploitation of trans-Arctic maritime transportation based upon the mining of big data. Because Arctic sea ice prone regions are a significant challenge for charting Arctic routes, state-of-the art remote sensing datasets can provide an accurate and reliable approach to monitoring near real-time large-scale variability of Arctic sea ice conditions. Large-sized datasets of weather/climate modeling can provide a short-term forecast and long-term prediction on changes of Arctic sea ice and related weather/climate conditions, which are indispensable for the exploitation of trans-Arctic maritime transportation. Based on these big data, the authors established the near real-time dynamic optimal trans-Arctic route system to guarantee safe, secure, and efficient trans-Arctic navigation. Such dynamic maps will help the pilots of vessels to maintain safe distances from icebergs and large-size ice floes and to save time, fuel and operational costs and risks.

TI  - Modeling net ecosystem carbon balance and loss in coastal wetlands exposed to sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion
AB  - Coastal wetlands are globally important stores of carbon (C). However, accelerated sea-level rise (SLR), increased saltwater intrusion, and modified freshwater discharge can contribute to the collapse of peat marshes, converting coastal peatlands into open water. Applying results from multiple experiments from sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense)-dominated freshwater and brackish water marshes in the Florida Coastal Everglades, we developed a system-level mechanistic peat elevation model (EvPEM). We applied the model to simulate net ecosystem C balance (NECB) and peat elevation in response to elevated salinity under inundation and drought exposure. Using a mass C balance approach, we estimated net gain in C and corresponding export of aquatic fluxes (F AQ ) in the fresh- water marsh under ambient conditions (NECB = 1119 +/- 229 gC m(-2) year(-1); F-AQ = 317 +/- 186 gC m(-2) year(-1)). In contrast, the brackish water marsh exhibited substantial peat loss and aquatic C export with ambient (NECB = -366 +/- 15 gC m(-2) year(-1); F-AQ = 311 +/- 30 gC m(-2) year(-1)) and elevated salinity (NECB = -594 +/- 94 gC m(-2) year(-1): F-AQ = 729 +/- 142 gC m(-2) year(-1)) under extended exposed conditions. Further, mass balance suggests a considerable decline in soil C and corresponding elevation loss with elevated salinity and seasonal dry-down. Applying EvPEM, we developed critical marsh net primary productivity (NPP) thresholds as a function of salinity to simulate accumulating, steady-state, and collapsing peat elevations. The optimization showed that similar to 150-1070gC m(-2) year(-1) NPP could support a stable peat elevation (elevation change approximate to SLR), with the corresponding salinity ranging from 1 to 20 ppt under increasing inundation levels. The C budgeting and modeling illustrate the impacts of saltwater intrusion, inundation, and seasonal dry-down and reduce uncertainties in understanding the fate of coastal peat wetlands with SLR and freshwater restoration. The modeling results provide management targets for hydrologic restoration based on the ecological conditions needed to reduce the vulnerability of the Everglades' peat marshes to collapse. The approach can be extended to other coastal peatlands to quantify C loss and improve understanding of the influence of the biological controls on wetland C storage changes for coastal management.

TI  - Well construction hydraulics in challenging environments
AB  - Hydraulics plays a major role in well construction, especially in narrow operational window scenarios, where the difference between pore and frac pressures approaches zero. Besides, special geometry wells, where annular friction losses contribute expressively to downhole pressures, are becoming attractive alternatives to enhance production. Efficient drilled cuttings transport, minimization of contamination during fluid substitution operations and gravel packing are critical operations to be performed. The hydraulic targets for such projects require multidisciplinary technological development, including real time monitoration of downhole pressure, density and friction reduction concepts, chemicals and equipment, rheology optimization and reliable multiphase models. This article focuses on the application of latest design, chemicals, software, and equipment technology for drilling and completing (including sand control) in challenging scenarios, such as ultra deepwater exploratory wells, extended reach offshore wells, 2000 m horizontal section in shallow water carbonate reservoirs, 1200 m horizontal section gravel packing in deep water non consolidated sandstone reservoirs, managed pressure drilling onshore experiences, extended reach onshore wells for offshore reservoir exploitation, including slant rig drilling and open hole gravel packing with synthetic low viscosity fluids. Finally, the hydraulic challenges for the future will be highlighted. Copyright 2011, SPE/IADC Drilling Conference and Exhibition.

TI  - Corrosion Protection of bridges for a lifetime by thermally sprayed zinc based duplex coating systems
AB  - Bridges are subject to extreme corrosion attack due to the surrounding conditions. Chlorides in a maritime atmosphere, de-icing salts or Sulphur Dioxide in an industrial atmosphere cause high corrosion rates if mild steel is left unprotected. The paper shows the best corrosion protection for a long service life under all these conditions offered by a duplex-coating combining a thermally sprayed zinc-based layer with a fitting top-coat. It introduces the thermal spraying process and its application on bridges, which can be performed in the plant or at the worksite, during erection and for repair work. Thermal Spraying is a well-established process which has been in existence for more than a hundred years. It is used manually, semi-automated and fully automated. Thermal Spraying with zinc and zinc-alloys is a "cold" process having no influence on the microstructure of the coated steel. It refers to worldwide standards and norms, which assure the highest quality of material, work and coatings. Worldwide references on steel bridges are presented as well as the latest developments in research. Throughout this abstract, the results of an intensive study over a service life of more than 26 years of duplex systems for Offshore Wind Energy plants is shown. In conclusion, the presentation also offers a quick view to the application of thermal spraying on concrete bridge structures to protect the rebar by cathodic protection.

TI  - Long-term performance prediction of oscillating wings for assisting ship propulsion at actual seas
AB  - In order to raise ship energy efficiency, the possibility of wave energy recovery by a pair of coilspring connected oscillating wings for assisting ship propulsion in waves is investigated. A frequency domain hydrodynamic model based on potential theory is established to predict the effect of the oscillating wings on the ship in regular waves, in terms of reducing wave-added resistance and improving seakeeping performance. The proposed linear model is suitable for short-term prediction based on conventional spectral analysis techniques, thus making it possible to evalute the long-term performance of oscillating wings for assisting ship propulsion at actual seas based on wave statistics. A sample containership is adopted to study the performance of the proposed concept. The results show that the oscillating wings can effectively reduce the added resistance of the ship at actual seas. The feasibility of this green ship technology is proved. Â© 2013 Shanghai Jiaotong University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Dynamic analysis and design methods for combustion turbine exhaust silencers employing acoustical baffles
AB  - Combustion turbines are frequently used because they provide the most power in the smallest footprint and their modular design makes them an economical choice. These machines are used across all land-based industries as well as marine applications. The exhaust system must perform its basic function of conducting exhaust gases, which can be as high as 1250Â° F (675Â° C), safely away from the adjacent equipment and workers, and mitigate the exhaust noise under a wide range of requirements and conditions. In addition, new requirements limit shell temperatures and exhaust leakage to prevent fire or explosion of fuel gas that may leak from equipment (ATEX). This paper presents a review of the analytical processes used in the development of a silencer system to achieve optimal performance metrics. These systems are typically comprised of parallel baffles for a wide range of conditions including aeroacoustical performance, system pressure and high flow rates, thermal stresses, environmental conditions (ocean, seismic and wind), flow-induced vibration, corrosion, and fatigue-design life analysis. The specific requirements of the baffle design will be discussed through a specific case study relative to typical rectilinear (parallel) baffles used in many installations, including land-based power generation plants (Figure 1), and offshore platforms (Figure 2). This paper will discuss the analytical methods used to address these challenges via a case study. A combination of static, vibration-pulsation and dynamic structural analysis with specific attention to the seismic analysis of the parallel baffles used in skirt and structural steel supported vessels, as well as acoustical design and flow modeling techniques are used to evaluate the design options.

TI  - The early evolution of climate engineering research
AB  - The emerging climate engineering (CE) debate will be fed by scientific information-and likely by misinformation as well. The first intense, international studies of any type of CE began in the early 1990s with ocean iron fertilisation, a method associated with the carbon dioxide removal branch of CE techniques. The ocean fertilisation experiments and analyses led to discussions by scientists and stakeholders about not only the environmental advantages and disadvantages but also political and ethical concerns. While a major part of the future evolution of CE research will extend on some of the trajectories outlined above, especially the expansion of community-wide multi-model studies, a highly uncertain direction of development involves future field testing of CE. Many CE studies have already been published in the separate disciplines, with only a few interdisciplinary studies so far, and even less trans-disciplinary work.

TI  - Effect of explosive shallow hydrothermal vents on Î”13C and growth performance in the seagrass Posidonia oceanica
AB  - Explosive volcanic submarine activity is expected to affect seagrass communities due to sudden and dramatic changes in the physical and chemical features of sea water and sediments, with possibly large ecosystem effects. However, seagrass response to the harsh environmental conditions that arise due to explosive volcanism is as yet unexplored as it is not easy to predict when and where an eruption will occur. Here, we investigate the uptake of hydrothermal carbon within the seagrass Posidonia oceanica by the analysis of Î”13C and growth rates in tissue laid down before and after an exceptional and massive hydrothermal gas release in the Aeolian Islands (Italy, Mediterranean Sea). Hydrothermal submarine activity was recorded by P. oceanica, which showed a large and persistent 13C-depletion in both scales and rhizomes in the site close to the eruption. Both increased CO2 availability and reduced carbon demand, as a consequence of stressful environmental conditions (e.g. light limitation due to turbidity, high temperature), combined to give much lower Î”13C signatures. Our results suggest that the explosive volcanism caused physiological stress in the seagrass, leading to a reduction in productivity, whereas slower, more diffuse release of hydrothermal CO2 is known to enhance seagrass productivity. Synthesis. We analysed the effect of a sudden and large hydrothermal event on Î”13C interannual variations and growth of the seagrass P. oceanica. Our results confirm that shallow submarine hydrothermal vents can be used as natural laboratories for exploring biological responses to acute and often extreme environmental conditions. P. oceanica can record geological events by capturing CO2 derived from vent systems, with implications for habitat management to mitigate against raising CO2 levels and ocean acidification. This leads the way to further studies to evaluate the effects of hydrothermal carbon on shallow ecosystems. Â© 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation Â© 2010 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Microwave drying of drilled cuttings
AB  - Drilled cuttings contaminated by non-aqueous fluids (NAFs) are the waste generated by oil well drilling activities. Over the last twenty years, studies have been conducted to assess the effects that these residues have on the environment in both offshore and onshore scenarios. More restrictive environmental legislation and the need to reduce drilling costs (exploration and production) have led to the optimization of solid-liquid separation. Currently, in Brazil, the environmental offshore discharge threshold for synthetic materials is 6.9% by mass. Microwave radiation is a promising technology to remove the organic phase of these drilled cuttings. This paper presents microwave heating technique as a method for the treatment of contaminated drilled cuttings. This drying methodology was applied to contaminated cuttings and studied through a Design of Experiments (DOE), where the manipulated variables were NAF concentration, specific energy and mass. The responding variables were residual n-paraffm content, percentage of n-paraffin removed, mass flow and mass of n-paraffin removed per energy unit. Copyright 2013, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Evaluation of large-scale CO2 storage on fresh-water sections of aquifers: An example from the Texas Gulf Coast Basin
AB  - Large-scale injections Of CO2 into subsurface saline aquifers have been proposed to remediate climate change related to buildup of green house gases in the atmosphere. The pressure buildup caused by such injections may impact a volume of the basin significantly larger than the CO2 plume itself In areas with hydrological settings similar to the Gulf Coast Basin, the perturbation of the flow-field in deep parts of the basin could result in brines or brackish water being pushed up-dip into unconfined sections of the same formations or into the capture zone of fresh-water wells. The premise of the current study is that the details of multiple-phase flow processes necessary to model the near field evolution of the CO2 plume are not necessary to describe the impact of the pressure anomaly on up-dip aquifers. This paper quantitatively explores conditions under which shallow groundwater would be impacted by up-dip displacement of brines, utilizing an existing carefully calibrated flow model. Modeling an injection of water, arguably equivalent to 50 million tons of CO2/year for 50 years resulted in an average water-table rise of similar to 1 in, with minor increase in stream baseflow and larger increase in ground water evapotranspiration, but no significant change in salinity.

TI  - Robustly coordinated operational scheduling of a grid-connected seaport microgrid under uncertainties
AB  - The modern seaport system is becoming more electrified by integrating energy storage system, offshore renewable energy sources (RESs), and shore-to-ship power supply system. The energy management and operational scheduling aim to maximise the profit gain by transacting energy with the main grid, reduce the operation cost while minimising the emission at seaport territory. This work proposes a robustly coordinated operational scheduling method of a seaport microgrid as a grid-integrated energy hub under uncertain renewable energy sources power output and load demand. In the day-ahead operation planning, generators, unit commitment and shore-to-ship load schedules are optimised. To address the uncertainty in the renewable energy sources, the day-ahead operation planning is modelled as a two-stage robust optimisation model with conflicting objectives and solved with the column and constraints generation algorithm. These results are used as input parameters for the hour-ahead generation scheduling in the following day. With uncertainty realisation, a shorter time horizon with higher time resolution deterministic optimisation is carried out for the generation dispatch. The proposed method is verified with the IEEE-33 bus distribution network with different uncertainties sets. The simulation results have verified the robustness and effectiveness of the method in dealing with uncertainties. Coordination between day-ahead and hour-ahead not only improves the accuracy and performance of the final dispatch result but also meets the distribution network constraints at generation and load buses.

TI  - Carbon storage and emissions offset potential in an African dry forest, the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, Kenya
AB  - Concerns about rapid tropical deforestation, and its contribution to rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, increase the importance of monitoring terrestrial carbon storage in changing landscapes. Emerging markets for carbon emission offsets may offer developing nations needed incentives for reforestation, rehabilitation, and avoided deforestation. However, relatively little empirical data exists regarding carbon storage in African tropical forests, particularly for those in arid or semi-arid regions. Kenya's 416 km2 Arabuko-Sokoke Forest (ASF) is the largest remaining fragment of East African coastal dry forest and is considered a global biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al. 2000), but has been significantly altered by past commercial logging and ongoing extraction. Forest carbon storage for ASF was estimated using allometric equations for tree biomass, destructive techniques for litter and herbaceous vegetation biomass, and spectroscopy for soils. Satellite imagery was used to assess land cover changes from 1992 to 2004. Forest and thicket types (Cynometra webberi dominated, Brachystegia spiciformis dominated, and mixed species forest) had carbon densities ranging from 58 to 94 Mg C/ha. The ASF area supported a 2.8-3.0 Tg C carbon stock. Although total forested area in ASF did not change over the analyzed time period, ongoing disturbances, quantified by the basal area of cut tree stumps per sample plot, correlated with decreased carbon densities. Madunguni Forest, an adjoining forest patch, lost 86% of its forest cover and at least 76% of its terrestrial carbon stock in the time period. Improved management of wood harvesting in ASF and rehabilitation of Madunguni Forest could substantially increase terrestrial carbon sequestration in the region.

TI  - Contribution of unvegetated tidal flats to coastal carbon flux
AB  - Unvegetated flats occupy a large area in the intertidal zone. However, compared to vegetated areas, the carbon sequestration of unvegetated tidal flats is rarely quantified, even though these areas are highly threatened by human development and climate change. We determined benthic maximum gross primary production (GPP(m)), net primary production (NPP) and total respiration (TR) during emersion on seven tidal flats along a latitudinal gradient (from 22.48 degrees N to 40.60 degrees N) in winter and summer from 2012 to 2016 to assess the spatial and temporal variability of carbon dioxide flux. In winter, these processes decreased by 89\%-104\% towards higher latitudes. In summer, however, no clear trend was detected across the latitudinal gradient. Quadratic relationships between GPP(m), NPP and TR and sediment temperature can be described along the latitudinal gradient. These curves showed maximum values of GPP(m) and NPP when the sediment temperatures reached 28.7 and 26.6 degrees C respectively. TR increased almost linearly from 0 to 45 degrees C. The maximum daily NPP across the latitudinal gradient averaged 0.24 +/- 0.28 g C m(-2) day(-1), which was only 10\%-20\% of the global average of NPP of vegetated coastal habitats. Multiplying with the global area of unvegetated tidal flats, our results suggest that the contribution of NPP on unvegetated tidal flats to the coastal carbon cycle is small (11.04 +/- 13.32 Tg C/year). If the land cover of vegetated habitats is continuously degraded to unvegetated tidal flats, the carbon sequestration capacity in the intertidal zone is expected to reduce by at least 13.10 Tg C/year, equivalent to 1\% of global carbon emissions from land-use change.

TI  - Using Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) desalting system for less environmental impacts in Qatar
AB  - In Qatar, the multi stage flash (MSF) system which is predominantly used for desalting seawater has negative impacts on the environment due to burning fossil fuels that emit greenhouse gases. Impingement and entrainment of marine organisms at the intake, higher temperatures and salinity as well as chemical pollution at the outfall are the main footprints on the marine environment. The objective of this paper is to show the main benefits on the environment of using the seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) process over the MSF process for the present desalination capacity of 1.2Mm3/d in 2012. The study showed that the seawater intake would be reduced about 3 times from 8.4Mm3/d to 3.6Mm3/d, which decreases the impingement and entrainment of marine organisms at the intake. Hence the corresponding discharge of brine and cooling water could be reduced from 7.2Mm3/d to 2.4Mm3/d for MSF and SWRO, respectively. Moreover, the thermal pollution of the rejected effluents from MSF plants could be eliminated and the chlorine residual would be reduced dramatically when using SWRO. Finally, the use of SWRO saves up to 75% of energy use, and thus the CO2 emissions would be reduced from 3.564 to 0.891million (M) tons per year. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Long-term simulation of the Snohvit CO2 storage
AB  - The purpose of this study is to simulate and evaluate the long-term (1000 years) consequences of carbon dioxide injection into a deep (2700 m) saline formation in the Snohvit field located offshore in the northern Norwegian Sea. During the 30-year-lifetime of the project, which began in summer 2007, approximately 23 million tons of CO2 are injected through one well. In order to analyse different possible CO2 migration pathways, several scenarios have been assumed and simulated. They deal with the sealing capacity of the main faults and of the saline formation cap rock. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Antarctica-to-Western Australia liquid freshwater shipments using stauber bags in a paternoster-like transfer system: Inaugurating a southern ocean antidrought action sea-lane
AB  - Australia is one of the driest continents on earth with most interior lands classified as steppe or desert. With an expanding coastal population pushing farther inland, the need for freshwater increases for urban use, agriculture, and industry and because there is little freshwater at the surface and most of the groundwater is too saline and generally unsuitable for multiple uses, new sources of freshwater must be sought to sustain future development of Western Australia's interior. To mitigate this ongoing macroproblem, it is proposed to establish a new Southern Ocean maritime sea-lane between Antarctica and Western Australia with the first large-scale deployment of very capacious floating liquid freshwater containers (Stauber bags), barges hauled and shuttled regularly by carousel-type supertugboats to convey a directly acquired, essentially cost-free, bulk-harvested potable subglacial Antarctic meltwater possibly siphoned from beneath the floating Amery Ice Shelf and transported to Western Australia. Access of the floating liquid freshwater containers to Perth, the capital city, would be up-slope the offshore Perth Canyon to the continental shelf. Stored containers could lay off in the lee of Rottnest Island at the Perth Terminal. From there, freshwater could be transported to wherever needed in coastal rural and urban Western Australia. On land, Pecero self-rolling bags could be used to distribute all imported freshwater farther inland and serve also as stationary (parked) reservoirs. Stock watering, farm irrigation, and drinking water as well as mineral mine, petroleum refinery, and sewage treatment processing are likely additional income-producing consumptive users. Both bulk long-distance conveyance and long-term storage on land by such means will naturally reduce the present-day stress on Western Australia's domestic water supplies, storage, and delivery systems that are limited by regional climates with long-term seasonal dryness. Freshwater imported would absolutely reduce freshwater stress on Western Australia's excessivelyexploited rivers and excessively mined aquifers. Â© 2011 Coastal Education & Research Foundation.

TI  - The potential of high heat generating granites as EGS source to generate power and reduce CO2 emissions, western Arabian shield, Saudi Arabia
AB  - Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil and gas to generate electricity and to desalinate sea water is widely perceived to be economically and politically unsustainable. A recent business as usual simulation concluded that the Kingdom would become an oil importer by 2038. There is an opportunity for the country to over come this problem by using its geothermal energy resources. The heat flow and heat generation values of the granites spread over a cumulative area of 161,467 sq. km and the regional stress regime over the western Saudi Arabian shield strongly suggest that this entire area is potential source of energy to support 1) electricity generation, 2) fresh water generation through desalination and 3) extensive agricultural activity for the next two decades. The country can adopt a policy to harness this vast untapped enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) to mitigate climate and fresh water related issues and increase the quantity of oil for export. The country has inherent expertise to develop this resource. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Heavywall forged pipe made from newly developed hollow steel ingots for use in large offshore structures
AB  - A new material for large offshore structures was developed. The new process involves hollow-input making, forging, normalizing/tempering, and final machining. Tests were conducted using full-size models measuring 48 inches in outside diameter (OD), 4 inches in wall thickness (WT), and 220 inches in length. Test results show that the new heavywall forged pipe improved the reliability of node cans for offshore structures, such as oil exploration and production platforms. With offshore structures becoming larger and larger in size, the reliability of their structural members, particularly nodes, takes on increased significance. The heavywall forged pipe made from newly developed hollow steel ingots will contribute to the construction of large offshore structures, especially because hollow ingots can be produced in large unit weights of up to 140 tons.

TI  - Standalone hybrid wind-solar power generation system applying dump power control without dump load
AB  - This paper proposes a unique standalone hybrid power generation system, applying advanced power control techniques, fed by four power sources: wind power, solar power, storage battery, and diesel engine generator, and which is not connected to a commercial power system. Considerable effort was put into the development of active-reactive power and dump power controls. The result of laboratory experiments revealed that amplitudes and phases of ac output voltage were well regulated in the proposed hybrid system. Different power sources can be interconnected anywhere on the same power line, leading to flexible system expansion. It is anticipated that this hybrid power generation system, into which natural energy is incorporated, will contribute to global environmental protection on isolated islands and in rural locations without any dependence on commercial power systems.

TI  - SiteChar - Methodology for a Fit-for-Purpose Assessment of CO2 Storage Sites in Europe
AB  - The FP7-funded SiteChar project examined the entire CO2 geological storage site characterisation process, from the initial feasibility studies through to the final stage of application for a CO2 storage permit based on criteria defined by the relevant European legislation. The SiteChar workflow for CO2 geological storage site characterisation provides a description of all elements of a site characterisation study, as well as guidance to streamline the site characterisation process and make sure that the output covers the aspects mentioned in the European Community (EC) Storage Directive. Five potential European storage sites, representative of prospective geological contexts, were considered as test sites for the research work: a North Sea multi-store site (hydrocarbon field and aquifer) offshore Scotland; an onshore aquifer in Denmark; an onshore gas field in Poland; an aquifer offshore in Norway; and an aquifer in the Southern Adriatic Sea. This portfolio combines complementary sites that allowed to encompass the different steps of the characterisation workflow. A key innovation was the development of internal `dry-run' permit applications at the Danish and Scottish sites and their review by relevant regulatory authorities. This process helped to refine the site characterisation workflow, and aimed to identify remaining gaps in site-specific characterisation, needed to secure storage permits under the EC Storage Directive as implemented in `host' Member States. SiteChar considered the important aspect of the public awareness and public opinions of these new technologies, in parallel to technical issues, on the onshore Polish and offshore Scottish sites. A new format to assist public opinion-forming processes was tested involving a small sample of local communities. Generic as well as site-specific information was made available to the general and local public via the internet and at information meetings. These exercises provide insight in the way implementation of CCS project plans may be perceived by local stakeholders, and inform approaches to develop effective local communication and participation strategies. Key lessons from the research conducted in SiteChar were developed as technical recommendations for storage site characterisation and best practice guidance for storage permitting from the perspective of both applicant and regulator. A best practice guide for policymakers and regulators at Member States and European levels, potential storage site developers and operators has been presented.

TI  - Development of an Eco-Sustainable Solution for the Second Life of Decommissioned Oil and Gas Platforms: The Mineral Accretion Technology
AB  - With the approaching end of the productive lives of offshore oil and gas platforms, the issue about decommissioning and what to do with existing structures arises. In this regard, this study aims to test solutions, at a preliminary level, for the eco-sustainable reuse of platforms at the end of their extraction phase. In particular, mineral accretion technology is applied by low-voltage electrolysis of seawater due to the precipitation of calcium carbonate on a cathode material in order to assess the protection capacity of the platforms against corrosion. This approach allows the extension of a platform's ``life{''} under a more sustainable purpose. The results, derived from laboratory and field experiments, will allow us to reduce uncertainties and define the best operating conditions to increase the efficiency of the mineral accretion technology in the marine ecosystem. The data collection on the main parameters that influence the process (i.e., temperature, salinity, and applied current) and the quantitative analysis of the collected material allowed us to acquire a better knowledge about mineral composition and deposition rate.

TI  - Spatial Variation of Soil Organic Carbon and Total Nitrogen in the Coastal Area of Mid-Eastern China
AB  - Soils play an important role in sequestrating atmospheric CO2. Coastal tidal flats have been intensively reclaimed for food security and living spaces worldwide. We aimed to identify the changes of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) following coastal reclamation and their spatial variation in the coastal area of mid-Eastern China to provide information for coastal cropland management. We measured SOC and TN of 463 soil samples in the coastal plain of mid-Eastern China. The results showed that SOC and TN increased highly from the uncultivated coastal tidal flat (2.49 g.kg(-1) and 0.21 g.kg(-1), respectively) to the cropland (10.73 g.kg(-1) and 1.3 g.kg(-1), respectively). After long-term cultivation, SOC and TN in the old farmland (12.98 g.kg(-1) and 1.49 g.kg(-1), respectively) were greater than those in the young farmland (5.76 g.kg(-1) and 0.86 g.kg(-1), respectively). The density of SOC in the uncultivated coastal tidal flat, young farmland, and old farmland were 0.68 kg.C.m(-2), 1.52 kg.C.m(-2), and 3.31 kg.C.m(-2), respectively. The density of TN in the uncultivated coastal tidal flat, young farmland and old farmland were 0.05 kg.N.m(-2), 0.23 kg.N.m(-2), and 0.38 kg.N.m(-2), respectively. The C/N (11.17) in the uncultivated coastal tidal flat was highest comparing to that in the young and old farmland due to lower nitrogen. The C/N increased from 6.78 to 8.71 following cultivation. Reclaimed coastal tidal flats had high carbon and nitrogen sequestration potential that not only mitigated the threat of global warming, but also improved soil fertility for crop production. Coastal management of cropland should consider the spatial distribution of SOC and TN to improve ecosystem services of coastal soils.

TI  - Profitable grid coupling. High voltage direct current transmission sea cable connects Norway to the Netherlands [Profitable netzkopplung. HGÃœ-seekabel verbindet Norwegen und die Niederlande]
AB  - A 580 km long sea cable now connects Feda, Norway to Eemshaven, The Netherlands. The transmission of 700 Mw (el.) avg officially began on September 11, 2008 after a four-month test phase. The transmission of the new NorNed system is in both directions. Its technology is based on high voltage direct current transmission (HochspannungsgleichstromÃ¼bertragung, HGÃœ) working with thyristors. The discussion covers introduction; Norwegian storage power plant useful to cover peak loads (a question of precipitation); and following projects in view. Each of the grid operators, Statnett of Norway and TenneT of The Netherlands, provided half of the total 600 million euro project, of which 500 million euros were for the infrastructure. The project planning took over 10 yr. Because the NorNed project is profitable, the original amortization time of 15 years has been reduced. In the first 3 operating months profits were 72 million euros. With this as background, the operators already consider a second NorNed line. Whether the transport of electric power will come mainly from Norway depends on the annual rainfall in Norway. In a normal year average electric power generation from Norwegian hydro power plants is about 120 Tw-hr This is about 99% of the overall electric power generation. Over two thirds of this occurs in storage power plants so are of flexible use. In a normal year, Norway must also import about 8 Tw-hr of electric power. In a dry year the generation of Norwegian hydropower can drop to 90 Tw-hr so that over 30 Tw-hr are imported. In six of the last 10 yr Norway was a net electric power importer. The NorNed project allows for some of these imports to come from The Netherlands. By means of the sea cable, Norway now has access to electric power imports from power plant capacity in Central Europe. Norway also has HGÃœ connections for feed optimization of large offshore wind parks in the North and Baltic seas. HGÃœ technology can also be used to transport electric power long distances from solar power plants in the global sunbelt. ABB supplied the inverter stations at both ends of the sea cable and supplied most of the sea cable itself. Up to now the HGU connection is used to export peak load electric power from Norwegian hydro power plants to The Netherlands. The cable once made was wound onto a cable drum. The 580 km length weighed about 45,000 tonnes, too heavy for any one ship to carry, so it was set in the sea in sections with special connectors. The cable was placed up to 3 m into the seabed or was covered with rocks and stones to protect it from anchors and fishing nets. Norwegian hydropower use reduces CO2 emissions in Europe by 1.7 million tonnes/yr.

TI  - Offshore processing of CO2 rich natural gas with supersonic separator versus conventional routes
AB  - The supersonic separator (SS) was investigated for treating humid natural gas with 44\%mol CO2 in offshore rigs and compared to the conventional Water Dew Point Adjustment (WDPA) via TEG Absorption, Hydrocarbon Dew Point Adjustment (HCDPA) via Joule-Thomson Expansion (JTE) and CO2 removal via Membrane Permeation (MP). SS was tested as a single-step operation for WDPA HCDPA. To simulate SS and MP, two Unit Operation Extensions (UOE) were developed for simulator HYSYS 8.8 (AspenTech). MP-UOE uses an empirical approach calibrated with operation data, whereas SS-UOE is entirely funded on thermodynamics, not demanding calibration. MP-UOE and SS-UOE use the thermodynamic infrastructure of HYSYS: property packages and several proved multiphase flash algorithms. MP-UOE and SS-UOE performed accordingly the expected characteristics of the respective operations and were critical to accomplish this analysis as SS and MP are not available in simulators. In terms of final gas quality (WDP <= -45 degrees C @1.01 bar, HCDP <= 0 degrees C @45 bar, \%CO2 <= 15\%mol) the best process configuration was found to be a hybrid one: SS WDPA HDPA and MP CO2 removal, with low footprint and low power demand (-6.9\%) relative to conventional 3-step way. If used for CO2 removal, SS could abate CO2 from 44\% to 21.85\%mol. Albeit less effective than MP, SS CO2 removal is a noticeable option that produces fuel gas for power generation with \%CO2 approximate to 20\% as required by new turbo-shafts. Moreover, CO2 is withdrawn from SS as a pumpable liquid allowing a cut of 44\% in the power demanded for CO2 separation and injection as EOR agent. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modeling the interactions among green shipping policies
AB  - Many policies and practical measures have been designed for emission reduction in shipping. Many have studied their contribution to emission reduction and impacts on the shipping industry without considering their interactions. This study analyzes how a change in one policy or measure affect the others using a system pulse model. The results suggest that the factors influencing shipping emissions are inter-dependent, and the developed systematic shipping emission model fluctuates periodically. We find that slow steaming is actually not effective in emission reduction in the long-run as it impacts the implementation of other policies. It poses a high demand for the adoption of the EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index) policy so as to promote the application of advanced technologies in the shipbuilding process. It also suggests that although the implementation of the EEDI policy can promote the adoption of the EEOI (Energy Efficiency Operating Index) policy, the EEOI policy actually relieves the demand for the EEDI policy.

TI  - Estimation of CO2 storage capacity in saline aquifers in west of South China Sea
AB  - Many natural gas fields discovered in the west of South China Sea, such as DF1-1, YC13-1 and Ledong, are associated with high concentration of CO2. Considerable amounts of CO2 has to be separated from natural gas stream during the development of these gas fields each year. In order to reduce the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere, geological storage of CO2 in deep saline aquifers has been considered. This study is aimed at selecting saline aquifers in the Yinggehai region, intending to carry out a CO2 storage demonstration project. Five candidate aquifers are selected and their capacities of CO2 storage are estimated based on an accurate method which considers various mechanisms of CO2 storage in aquifers as well as the influence of aquifer structural features on CO2 migration and distribution. The assessment results show that all five aquifers are good candidates for CO2 storage with high storage potential to store all the CO2 expected during the demonstration project, and also can provide storage sites for the man-made CO2 in Hainan and Guangdong provinces in the near future.

The model results indicate that the fate of disposed CO2 is strongly dependent on droplet size. If small droplets can be created and maintained, open ocean outlets may become a practical disposal technique. However, the pH of water peeling off from the plume is so low that marine life outside the plume would be affected.

TI  - A better cold weather battery for arctic environments
AB  - Alternative energy sources such as solar and wind can generate power intermittently, and with the use of inexpensive, environmentally-safe batteries, such systems can achieve improved performance. These batteries also are designed for energy storage with excess diesel power generation during off-peak times, and could also supplement biomass, tidal and geothermal sources. Our approach focuses on developing a battery which (i) works in extreme environmental temperatures, as found in rural Alaska; (ii) is easily assembled from raw subcomponents to keep costs down (where local residents can do the manufacturing), allowing the collection and dismantling of used batteries for proper recycling; (iii) create a high power density battery for mobile requirements. Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) will be utilized for design, fabrication and testing of a known battery chemistry. We will focus on creating Zn2SnO4 powder and use prior knowledge to design and fabricate the novel cold-weather high-density battery, lithium zinc stannate (Li Zn2SnO4).

TI  - Pressure effects on heat transfer in hydrate-bearing deposit with drilling fluid invasion by lab simulation
AB  - Natural gas hydrate is a potential green energy resource widely distributed in tundra or offshore layers. During deepwater drilling in hydrate-bearing layers, certain artificial operation will induce hydrate to break down, causing the disasters such as landslide, collapse, and blowout. The heat and mass transfer in layers is the key point to predict and control these risks, but difficult to be described due to phase transition. In this study, a series of experiments have been designed to simulate hydrate-bearing deposits with drilling fluid invasion under different pressure. The initial pressure in wellbore and pore were adjusted separately, and the real-time temperature at different positions were monitored. The results implied that a higher wellbore pressure can promote invasion, but its effect is limited by the distance from the wellbore. Initial pore pressure mainly influenced the phase equilibrium critical temperature. Since the dissociation gas contra-streaming into wellbore will further accelerate hydrate dissociation, a reasonable wellbore pressure should be optimized, which is conductive to the drilling safety.

TI  - Qualification of a subsea separator with on-line desanding capability for shallow-water applications
AB  - ExxonMobil Development Company (EMDC) recently completed a qualification program which included a multiphase, subsea separation system for shallow-water applications. This paper summarizes the results from this qualification program. Developments and advances in subsea processing technologies and the application of such technologies have been fueled by recent economic considerations in the oil and gas industry, as fields are maturing and operating companies strive to maintain oil and gas production. To-date, companies have executed project-specific qualification programs which take years of upfront engineering. The intent of this qualification program was to develop subsea separation technologies for the "global" subsea portfolio, rather than a specific project. To cover the "global" subsea portfolio, a separator design was chosen that would meet separation performance targets over a wide range of operating conditions. For subsea applications, availability and reliability is critical, as unplanned intervention costs are extremely high; therefore, only certain internals were recommended to avoid plugging and fouling issues. Also, the separator was equipped with sand handling internals, including sand jetting headers and sand removal cyclones, to allow online fluidization and removal of accumulated sand. Qualification activities included the development of a subsea processing template, design validation of a multiphase separator design using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and performance tests with model fluids and "live" fluids, and performance tests on the sand handling equipment. High-level results from these tests are shared. Prior to the qualification programs, experience with subsea separation technologies, and subsea processing as a whole, within ExxonMobil was limited to being an active partner with subsea processing projects such as Tordis and Pazflor. Following the execution of the aforementioned qualification programs, technical risks have been mitigated, such that it is now possible to be confident in applying these technologies in the "global" subsea portfolio. This will enable ExxonMobil to reduce the cost and schedule impact of upfront engineering on future subsea processing projects. In the ever-changing business environment of the oil and gas industry, this may become a preferred approach to bring unproven technologies to maturity when the business need is well-established.

TI  - Simplified Method for Vibration Model of Converter Valve in Offshore HVDC Substation Based on Response Surface
AB  - To ensure the computational accuracy for the offshore high voltage direct current substation local structure and its large and complex electrical equipment, it is necessary to reduce the modeling complexity and improve the calculation efficiency. Thus, a simplified vibration model with constant key physical parameters was established; the converter valvewas used as a test design example and a lower number of samples was used. Finally, the response surface fitting was carried out. Based on the machine learning concept, problems such as the loss of physical meaning of complex system matrices and low iteration efficiency, caused by high-dimensional matrix operations were avoided. In addition, the deterministic screening experiment design greatly reduced the number of samples needed while also ensuring the second-order effect. The fit between the response surface equation and experimental results was good after optimizing the relevant design factors based on the vibration equation. The comparison between the simplified vibration converter valve model and the original complex model has shown that the errors for various physical parameters and the vibration characteristics were below 5\% and that the model simplification degree was 95\%.

TI  - Drivers of Atmosphere-Ocean CO2 Flux in Northern Norwegian Fjords
AB  - High-latitude fjords and continental shelves are shown to be sinks for atmospheric CO2, yet large spatial-temporal variability and poor regional coverage of sea-air CO2 flux data, especially from fjord systems, makes it difficult to scale our knowledge on how they contribute to atmospheric carbon regulation. The magnitude and seasonal variability of atmosphere-sea CO2 flux was investigated in high-latitude northern Norwegian coastal areas over 2018 and 2019, including four fjords and one coastal bay. The aim was to assess the physical and biogeochemical factors controlling CO2 flux and partial pressure of CO2 in surface water via correlation to physical oceanographic and biological measurements. The results show that the study region acts as an overall atmospheric CO2 sink throughout the year, largely due to the strong undersaturation of CO2 relative to atmospheric concentrations. Wind speed exerted the strongest influence on the instantaneous rate of sea-air CO2 exchange, while exhibiting high variability. We concluded that the northernmost fjords (Altafjord and Porsangerfjord) showed stronger potential for instantaneous CO2 uptake due to higher wind speeds. We also found that fixation of CO2 was likely a significant factor controlling Delta pCO(2) from April to June, which followed phenology of spring phytoplankton blooms at each location. Decreased Delta pCO(2) and the resulting sea-air CO2 flux was observed in autumn due to a combined reduction of the mixed layer with entrain of high CO2 subsurface water, damped biological activity and higher surface water temperatures. This study provides the first measurements of atmospheric CO2 flux in these fjord systems and therefore an important new baseline for gaining a better understanding on how the northern Norwegian coast and characteristic fjord systems participate in atmosphere carbon regulation.

TI  - Long-term monitoring data logs of a recirculating artificial seawater based colonial ascidian aquaculture
AB  - This article presents and describes data related to the monitoring of our in-land in-lab marine recirculating artificial seawater husbandry system for breeding colonial ascidians {[}1] over a timespan of three years. These datasets were collected both automatically as well as manually, and include abiotic parameters (salinity, pH, temperature, ORP), concentrations of noxious ions (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, PO43-), the full lineaging of the colonies developing in the aquaculture setup, animal countings under four different feeding diets and animal survival in artificial seawater containing six different microbiota. Our aquaculture was used to breed two species of model colonial ascidians, Botrylloides diegensis {[}2,3] and Botryllus schlosseri {[}4]. All the datasets are provided as raw CSV files together with an analysis script to reproduce the figures of our accompanying research article {[}1]. These extensive datasets give detailed insights into the impact of culturing conditions on the breeding of colonial ascidians and could be used to investigate this intricate relationship.

TI  - Large-eddy simulation of double-plume formation induced by CO2 dissolution in the ocean
AB  - Using two-fluid LES technology, a numerical model is developed to simulate double-plume formation under conditions relevant to CO2 ocean sequestration applications. A small-scale ocean turbulent flow is created and maintained by a forced-dissipative mechanism and LES. Data on ocean currents, temperature and salinity were employed by the model as inlet boundary and initial conditions, respectively. A set of empirical formulae, calibrated with laboratory experimental data, was developed to describe momentum, mass and heat transfer phenomena. Using this model, the influence of the initial diameter of CO2 droplets released in the deep ocean and thermal effects on the structure of two plumes were investigated. The height of the CO2 droplet plume and the local minimum pH within the CO2-enriched seawater plume were found to be very sensitive to the initial diameter of injected CO2 droplets. Plume height and pH are two key parameters to assess CO2 sequestration efficiency and related biological impacts. Thermal effects associated with CO2 dissolution appeared to have limited influence on CO2-enriched seawater plume structure and pH, but can significantly affect the LCO2 plume and the temperature field near the CO2 injection nozzle.

TI  - Automatic slip status and stand detection in real-time drilling
AB  - The drilling process can be broken down into various activities from top-level activities (e.g., drilling and tripping) to lower-level activities (e.g., in-slip, out-of-slip, making connection, and circulation). The detection of the fundamental drilling unit, a stand, is necessary and essential for recognizing and inferring drilling activities. A new method is proposed to detect slip status, pipe change, and drilling/tripping stands based on real-time streaming data. The slip status is a critical element because it indicates a connection is made before drilling or tripping a stand. The proposed method is designed to infer the slip status with hookload, standpipe pressure (SPPA), and surface torque (STOR) sensor data. Specifically, the logic using hookload includes two criteria, a hookload standard deviation criterion and a dynamic hookload threshold criterion. This allows addressing the limitations of prior methods at shallow depth and using a manual threshold, which prevents the full automation of slip detection. In addition, the slip status can be confirmed or corrected with a logic using a combination of SPPA and STOR data. Then, a check is performed on whether a stand is added or removed during in-slip period. If needed, the stand detection can also be run to detect where a stand begins and ends. The method has been extensively tested and validated on many land and deepwater wells with drilling/ tripping operations. Without human intervention, the dynamic hookload threshold can be determined automatically and adaptively after one or two drilling or tripping stands. Moreover, the hookload standard deviation criterion works well to detect the change of slip status at shallow depth. It is shown that high accuracy of detection can be achieved when the streaming data have a proper range of sampling rate. The new method addresses two limitations of the existing methods: (1) it automatically determines the dynamic hookload thresholds and eliminates the need of setting up the hookload threshold manually, and (2) it improves the accuracy of slip status and stand detection at shallow depth. This innovative work enables the automation of the slip status and stand detection process in batch runs or in real time without operator input. Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Evaluating alternative energy carriers in ferry transportation using a stochastic multi-criteria decision analysis approach
AB  - As part of ship acquisition decision making, owners and key stakeholders need to evaluate ship design and technology solutions across economic and environmental criteria in addition to safety and other regulatory requirements. Changes in technology, market, fiscal and other regulatory conditions may furthermore significantly influence value retention over the investment period. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) provides structure and clarity in otherwise complex decision problems, allowing decision makers to identify promising courses of action in a holistic manner. Combined with stochastic evaluation techniques, MCDM may facilitate problem exploration and learning in situations where outcomes are uncertain. In this article, we combine two variants of â€œStochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysisâ€ (SMAA) with â€œTechnique for Ordering of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutionâ€ (TOPSIS) to evaluate the use of biofuels, natural gas and electricity on Norwegian ferry crossings. We analyze uncertain criteria values for environmental impacts, costs, fuel access and public acceptance across seven ferry combinations for a crossing. Criteria weighting is performed deterministically and stochastically to extract and interpret the conditions under which alternatives perform well or poorly. The case study shows that all-electric propulsion is preferable, while plug-in hybrid solutions with natural gas also give a robust performance. The approach is beneficial in handling multiple, uncertain performance metrics and provides a transparent and holistic foundation for evaluating marine emission reduction technology options in ship acquisition decision contexts.

TI  - FIRST GENERATION GRAZ CYCLE POWER PLANT FOR NEAR-TERM DEPLOYMENT
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a recognized technology pathway to curb the increasing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the power generation sector. But most available technologies are still on the study or laboratory-scale level, so that considerable R\&D efforts are needed to achieve commercialization level. The Graz Cycle originally presented in 1995 by Jericha {[}1] is an oxyfuel technology and promises highest efficiency using state-of-the-art turbine materials and improved thermodynamic developments in a comparatively complex interaction of rotating machinery, condensers and heat exchanger components. But although detailed conceptual design for all main components has been presented, there is still a large step towards a Graz Cycle pilot demonstration plant. In order to facilitate construction of a demonstration plant we consider the performance of a near-term Graz Cycle process design based on modest cycle data and available turbomachinery components using a simplified flow scheme. The work is supported by on-going development work for a first generation oxyfuel turbine that has already been undertaken by Clean Energy Systems, Inc. {[}2]. Their further work on a second generation oxyfuel turbine received \$30 million funding support from the U.S. Department of Energy in September 2010 {[}3]. Two near-term Graz Cycle plants are presented based on basic and advanced operating conditions of the proposed commercially available turbine. Besides the turbine the additional equipment for a first-generation cycle is discussed. The predicted optimum net efficiency is 23.2 \% (HHV). A near-term zero-emission power plant can only be commercially attractive if it will be deployed in a niche market. Therefore an economic analysis commensurate with an early pre-FEED conceptual study is carried out for the U.S. Gulf Coast where revenue from multiple product streams that could include power, steam, CO2 and water, as well as argon and (potentially) nitrogen from the ASU is provided. The economic analysis suggests that a capital investment of \$94 million can secure construction of a 13.2 MWe zero emission oxyfuel power plant and yield a 14.5\% (unlevered) return on capital invested.

TI  - Performance assessment of novel offshore cable detectors based on synthetic data
AB  - Submarine power cables are an important infrastructure in modern times to connect, for example, separate energy power grids or offshore windfarm with the mainland. The position of these buried cables is often known only roughly after installation due to several reasons. Therefore, a cable tracking system is used which can detect the cableâ€™s position. In this thesis, a novel system is presented which is based on inverting the magnetic field measured which is created by an active signal in the cable. An array of five three-axis fluxgate magnetometers measure the magnetic flux. Two different algorithms for detection are introduced. The first method relies on a simple model of the cable and a non-linear system of equation to estimate the location by inverting the total magnetic field measured by each sensor. The second approach uses the three-axis measurements to get the direction where the cable is from each sensor. The distance to the sensor array can be than estimated by using at least three different direction measurements. Both approaches are evaluated on synthetic data obtained by modelling the magnetic response of a cable in a marine environment. Copyright Â© EAGE 2018.

TI  - Soils and sediments of coastal ecology: A global carbon sink
AB  - The global extent of coasts is huge and it has a massive impact on the planetary C balance. Coasts are again very heterogeneous with their soils and sediments possessing varying C storing capacity. In this review, we tried to capture such capacity of soils and sediments of coastal natural ecologies (like estuary, mangrove, mudflat, tidal marsh, seagrass, lagoon, continental shelf etc.) and croplands collectively in a mechanistic way. A detail discussion highlights very high C accrual in coastal soils and sediments due to terrigenous C deposition, tidal sedimentation and presence of fine clay particles. Very high biomass of coastal mangrove, tidal marsh and seagrass beds also results huge C burial in soils and sediments (blue C). Further, salinity and waterlogging induced low microbial activities, high soil aggregation and occlusion of C within aggregates impart prolonged residence time to C in coastal soils. All these confirm coastal ecology as a global C hotspot. However, climate change associated events like sea-level rise, ocean temperature increase, ocean acidification as well as human interferences have already affected the coasts and projected trend indicates severe possible damage of the coastal blue C in near future. Holistic sustainable measures will be required from different ends like government, local as well as international organizations to protect and restore the coastal C sink. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Production of biodiesel from macroalgae by supercritical CO2 extraction and thermochemical liquefaction
AB  - We compare two different techniques for the extraction of biodiesel from macroalgae: the thermochemical liquefaction and the extraction using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2). The first allows to use wet material, while sc-CO2 requires dry material and uses moderate temperature and pressure so that it can be useful for the extraction of thermolabile compounds which may decompose at the temperature at which thermal methos are carried out. In both cases the extracted oil was characterized quantitatively and qualitatively. The novelty of the work is that in the literature the use of macroalgae for the production of biodiesel has not so far been described, while they are used mainly as food or other purposes.

TI  - Siting constraints for an offshore nuclear power plant
AB  - The offshore nuclear plant is a significant stride forward in today's technological world. However, siting studies not only remain as important as those for shore based plants but, in addition, new problems are faced and new investigative tools and techniques must be utilized. Important considerations for selection of an offshore site include: access to shore facilities; bathymetry; continental shelf processes; human and animal population near plant, at nearshore locations and along transmission lines; marine species in areas; mixing and temperature characteristics of water; nearshore ocean processes; nearby land and water use; operational storm meteorology; regional and site geology; seismicity; sociological aspects; visibility from shore. This paper focuses on these important parameters and each concept is explored and discussed. The constraints of offshore siting are examined in light of the authors' recent work on the Public Service Electric and Gas Company of New Jersey's Atlantic Generating Station. The use of weighting factors in establishing site priority is introduced and the importance of 'go-no-go' parameters is described.

TI  - Power cycle test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in extreme offshore environment
AB  - The reliability of power semiconductor switches is important when considering their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea applications. Respect to technology advancements in material sciences, power MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si) based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs. Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET, CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a real application such as downhole motor drives.

TI  - Optimization of drag reduction effect of air lubrication for a tanker model
AB  - The reduction of CO2 emissions has been a key target in the marine industry since the IMO's MEPC published its findings in 2009. Air lubrication method is one of the mature technologies for commercialization to reduce the frictional resistance and enhance fuel efficiency of ships. Air layer is formed by the coalescence of the injected air bubbles beyond a certain air flow rate. In this study, a model ship (lambda = 33.33) of a 50,000 ton medium range tanker is equipped with an air lubrication system. The experiments were conducted in the 100 m long towing tank facility at the Pusan National University. By selecting optimal air injector configuration and distribution ratio between two injectors, the total resistance of model R-TM was able to be reduced down to 18.1\% in the model scale. Key issue was found to suppress the sideway leakage of injected air by appropriate injection parameters. Copyright (C) 2017 Society of Naval Architects of Korea.

TI  - Fault reactivation case study for probabilistic assessment of carbon dioxide sequestration
AB  - This preliminary investigation into carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in a Brazilian offshore oil field has the objective of assessing the potential risk of caprock failure for CO2 geological storage in deep aquifers. The technical evaluation of a carbon storage site requires the sustainable pore pressure to be defined. CO2 injection into a hydrocarbon reservoir or aquifer alters the stress locally and also in the surrounding rocks. This brings with it the risk of geological fault reactivation, which would create a likely path for the escape of CO2 to other rock layers, or even to the surface. Several methodologies have been developed to estimate fault reactivation pressures; however, even the most sophisticated solutions depend on data reliability. The aim of this study was to investigate the loss of caprock integrity due to fault reactivation by geological carbon sequestration in a real aquifer using a probabilistic approach that considers the variation of the material properties and the initial stress state. The probabilistic response of the model was evaluated using the integrated nonlinear finite element simulator AEEPEC2DÂ® and NESSUSÂ® probabilistic analysis software. The random variables in the probabilistic model are the average effective vertical stress gradient, elastic modulus, Poisson[U+05F3]s ratio, the lateral earth pressure coefficient, and the cohesion, friction angle and thickness of the fault. The uncertainties in the properties both rock layers and faults were incorporated into the analysis using the mean value and advanced mean value plus methods. Geomechanical 2D finite element models of the formation were developed to evaluate the stress changes associated with pore pressure variation in cases where an induced fault slippage would be a threat to the integrity of the seal. The proposed methodology was applied to three realistic geological sections with several faults cutting the aquifer. The cumulative distribution curve of maximum admissible pore pressure variation was derived. In addition, the most influential variables for each fault were identified. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Toward a sustainable decentralizedwater supply: Review of adsorption desorption desalination (ADD) and current technologies: Saudi Arabia (SA) as a case study
AB  - Several regions are confronting a severe scarcity of fresh water due to the gap between supply and demand. They strive to bridge that gap by depleting nonrenewable water aquifers and expanding centralized energy-intensive desalination technologies. Continuing to adopt the same unsustainable approach could deplete the water aquifers and increase the consumption of fossil fuel and the ecological impact on air, water, and land. However, the traditional paradigm of centralized desalination systems could be shifted by increasing the utilization of renewable distributed generation, which can be coupled with emerging desalination technology such as adsorption desorption desalination (ADD), which has autonomous and resilient attributes that can contribute to the sustainability of decentralized fresh water supply in the future. In this work, three commercialized desalination technologies were reviewed and compared with emerging ones to explore the most economically and environmentally efficient systems within the context of decentralized water production. The well-known configurations of ADD were evaluated and compared with sea water reverse osmosis (SWRO), which is recognized as the principal commercialized desalination technology worldwide. The quantitative case study methodology was used by investigating four centralized seawater desalination plants in Saudi Arabia (SA) with their associated pipeline systems from the energy consumption point of view to determine the applicability of implementing ADD technology in SA and similar arid areas. The study reveals that adopting decentralized ADD technology coupled with renewable energy sources could reduce the specific energy consumption from 4 kWh/m3 to less than 1.38 kWh/m3. Combining reduced energy consumption from desalination plants and elimination of supply pipelines could potentially result in a significant reduction in energy consumption and carbon emissions. Finally, the study may be useful for researchers working on enhancing ADD processes, as well as technology users who would like to implement the most efficient ADD configurations. Additionally, it may initiate a direction of utilizing the results of original critical reviews as a methodology to develop the applied technologies. Â© 2020 by the authors.

TI  - A research on decreasing wind resistance of large containership
AB  - The new windshield was installed on the bow of the 6,700TEU containership MOL MARVEL, and a demonstration test of its effectiveness in reducing CO2 emissions is now under way. With today's larger containerships, the height of the containers loaded on their decks has increased, subjecting the vessels to greater wind resistance. The authors recognized the need to address this issue in a cost-effective way. Development of the new device began with an examination of the bow's aerodynamic form through wind tunnel testing. This led to the adoption of a horse-shoe shaped design, which encloses the front line of the stacked containers to maximize the wind resistance-reducing effect while minimizing the weight of the main unit. The new windshield has enough design strength to meet the ClassNK rules concerning wave impact pressure. With those measures, an annual average reduction of 2% in C2 emissions are expected, assuming the fore windshield is mounted on a 6,700 TEU containership plying the North Pacific Ocean route at speed of 17 knots. In addition, by the side windshield blocking the spaces between the every container bay, and the wing tail shape stowage in bays on the deck of ship's stern, the sides of the vessel will be more streamlined and further reducing wind resistance will be expected by about 5% total.

TI  - Carbon storage in depleted gas fields: Key challenges
AB  - It is recognized that most of the available geological storage capacity for CO2 is in saline aquifers. The best aquifers are likely to be in sedimentary basins (and in many cases near to fossil energy sources). However, unless the formations have been explored for hydrocarbon potential, it is likely that little data exists so significant work will be required to evaluate the realistic storage potential. Depleted gas fields offer more limited capacity but are better characterized, have seals that have successfully retained hydrocarbon gas for millions of years, and may offer a shorter route to practical implementation for early projects. Estimates indicate that depleted offshore gas fields in UK waters have the potential to store around 3.8 billion tonnes of CO2. This is a significant capacity and an inviting target particularly if existing infrastructure and wells can be reused. This paper explores the issues around injecting and storing CO2 in highly depleted gas fields using a case study based on the characteristics of a Southern North Sea gas field. The study shows that assessing and managing the flow control aspects of CO2 injection, particularly initially when the reservoirs are at very low pressure is going to be a major technical challenge. The challenges include a requirement for a high -tech flow control device at the base of the tubing to allow the dense phase CO2 to be expanded in a controlled manner. Also the requirement for CO2-specific well flow performance software as conventional software, designed to model the flow of hydrocarbons, is not necessarily suffciently rigorous when modeling a complex fluid like CO2, particularly the thermodynamics aspects. Understanding and mitigating Joule Thomson effects is necessary to avoid the possible formation of ice and gas hydrates. Without a comprehensive understanding of CO2 flow systems and accurate modeling of the thermodynamic effects it may not be possible to realize the potential that gas field storage offers.

TI  - The NEPTUNE Project - a cabled ocean observatory in the NE Pacific: Overview, challenges and scientific objectives for the installation and operation of Stage I in Canadian waters
AB  - NEPTUNE (North-East Pacific Undersea Networked Experiments) will be an innovative network of many sub-sea observatories linked by about 3,000 km of powered, electro-optic cable covering most of the Juan de Fuca Plate (200,000 sq km), North-East Pacific, with shore stations at Port Alberni, BC and probably Nedonna Beach, OR (www.neptunecanada.ca, www.orionprogram.org, www.neptune.washington.edu). Each observatory will host and power many scientific instruments on the surrounding seafloor, in boreholes in the seafloor, and buoyed into the water column. Remotely operated and autonomous vehicles will reside at depth, powered or recharged at observatories and directed from distant labs. Continuous near-real-time multidisciplinary measurement series will extend over 25 years. Major research themes include: structure and seismic behavior of the ocean crust; dynamics of hot and cold fluids and gas hydrates in the upper ocean crust and overlying sediments; ocean/climate change and effects on ocean biota/fisheries at all depths; deep-sea sedimentation' ecosystem dynamics and biodiversity; and engineering and computational systems research. These involve interacting processes, long-term changes, and chaotic, episodic events difficult to study and quantify by traditional means. The NEPTUNE, VENUS (Victoria Experimental Network Under the Sea), and MARS (Monterey Accelerated Research System) cabled observatories will use most of the same cable and engineering systems, with the latter two acting as shallow and deep-water test-beds, respectively, for the former. NEPTUNE is a Canada/US partnership with the total facility cost of about CAN\$250M. Over \$40M has already been funded for design, development and test beds. Funding (\$82.4M) for NEPTUNE Canada's installation of Stage I comes jointly from the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the BC Knowledge Development Fund. The NEPTUNE Canada team comprises 25 staff with others on contract. Alcatel Submarine Networks is contracted to design, manufacture and install the 800 km network loop with 5-6 observatory nodes with full operations starting in late 2008. Formal agreements are being concluded for the development of the observing systems for approved community science experiments, while the internal development of a Data Management and Archiving System (DMAS) is progressing well beyond the interim version designed for VENUS. Other discussions deal with First Nations, fishers, and national security issues. Future opportunities for innovative science, education and outreach, and public policy contributions are profound. Current and future planning, management issues, and opportunities and implications for new ways of performing science are discussed. VENUS and Stage 1 of NEPTUNE will form a linked coastal/regional ocean observatory system, and be among the first of many such cabled ocean observatories to be deployed worldwide. Selected applications include: a) new scientific knowledge and interpretations; b) developments of new technologies; c) renewable and non-renewable resource development; d) climate change driven by the oceans; e) hazard mitigation: earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, slope failures; f) sovereignty and security; g) port security and shipping; h) ocean management and policy formulation; and i) education, outreach and public information.

TI  - Global Shipping Emissions from a Well-to-Wake Perspective: The MariTEAM Model
AB  - Improving the robustness of maritime emission inventories is important to ensure we fully understand the point of embarkment for transformation pathways of the sector toward the 1.5 and 2Â°C targets. A bottom-up assessment of emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols from the maritime sector is presented, accounting for the emissions from fuel production and processing, resulting in a complete "well-to-wake"geospatial inventory. This high-resolution inventory is developed through the use of the state-of-the-art data-driven MariTEAM model, which combines ship technical specifications, ship location data, and historical weather data. The CO2 emissions for 2017 amount to 943 million tonnes, which is 11% lower than the fourth International Maritime Organization's greenhouse gas study for the same year, while larger discrepancies have been found across ship segments. If fuel production is accounted for when developing shipping inventories, total CO2 emissions reported could increase by 11%. In addition to fuel production, effects of weather and heavy traffic regions were found to significantly impact emissions at global and regional levels. The global annual efficiency for different fuels and ship segments in approximated operational conditions were also investigated, indicating the need for more holistic metrics than current ones when seeking appropriate solutions aiming at reducing emissions.

TI  - The ICT-supported Unified Process Model of Offshore Outsourcing of Software Production: Exploratory examination and validation
AB  - Various important benefits can be achieved through the successful management of offshore outsourcing. Numerous studies exist on outsourcing in general, yet the large extant literature on offshore outsourcing has dealt with information technology (IT) outsourcing from the client's perspective. Several frameworks, focusing on guiding information systems managers, for IT outsourcing have been developed. However, none of these frameworks attempted to provide a holistic guideline to manage the entire process of offshore outsourcing of software production. There is a significant lack of studies dealing with the management of offshore outsourcing of software production from both the vendor's and client's perspectives. Thus, there is a great need for studying such a multifaceted and complex phenomenon more deeply from both scenarios to find out the best practices for managing the unified process. In this study, we utilize the conceptual framework of The ICT-supported Unified Process Model of Offshore Software Production Outsourcing as our research model. We then validate this model by reviewing the large extant literature, and conducting multiple case studies from both the vendor's and client's viewpoints, where professionals with extensive experience in managing offshore outsourcing of software production are interviewed. The implications of the findings are discussed for both practical and research purposes.

TI  - A rock physics simulator and its application for CO2 sequestration process
AB  - Injection of CO2 into underground saline formations, due to their large storage capacity, is probably the most promising approach for the reduction of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. CO2 storage must be carefully planned and monitored to ensure that the CO2 is safely retained in the formation for periods of at least thousands of years. Seismic methods, particularly for offshore reservoirs, are the primary tool for monitoring the injection process and distribution of CO2 in the reservoir over time provided that reservoir properties are favourable. Seismic methods are equally essential for the characterisation of a potential trap, determining the reservoir properties, and estimating its capacity. Hence, an assessment of the change in seismic response to CO2 storage needs to be carried out at a very early stage. This must be revisited at later stages, to assess potential changes in seismic response arising from changes in fluid properties or mineral composition that may arise from chemical interactions between the host rock and the CO2. Thus, carefully structured modelling of the seismic response changes caused by injection of CO2 into a reservoir over time helps in the design of a long-term monitoring program. For that purpose we have developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) driven rock physics simulator, designed to model both short and long-term 4D seismic responses to injected CO2. The application incorporates CO2 phase changes, local pressure and temperature changes, chemical reactions and mineral precipitation. By incorporating anisotropic Gassmann equations into the simulator, the seismic response of faults and fractures reactivated by CO2 can also be predicted. We show field examples (potential CO2 sequestration sites offshore and onshore) where we have tested our rock physics simulator. 4D seismic responses are modelled to help design the monitoring program.

TI  - We need facts not nationalistic sentiment or party politics
AB  - Two generations of ministers have misrepresented the evidence for new nuclear power stations, basing their arguments on an assumption in favor of nuclear rather than examining the facts first. The scientific, environmental and political communities are all divided over what the future energy mix should look like, and how much faith one should place in gas, nuclear and renewables respectively. There is potential for the UK to lead the world in carbon capture and storage and in marine generation, but these technologies are at too early a stage to compete with wind and nuclear for the medium-term plans. It seems whatever the government, industry or agriculture wants to do these days there is an immediate, vociferous, often violent reaction in the form of anti-everything rent-a-mobs, to the point that we will stagnate unless some hard decisions are taken.

TI  - Integrating life cycle assessment and life cycle costing using TOPSIS to select sustainable biomass-based -carbonaceous adsorbents for CO2 capture
AB  - The release of carbon dioxide (CO2) through human activities causes the global warming issue. CO2 can be captured using a variety of carbonaceous adsorbents, such as activated carbon (AC), amine-modified activated carbon (ACNH), and graphene (G). However, the sustainability of these adsorbents needs to be investigated. The goal of this research is to find the most sustainable option from environmental, economic, and technical perspectives. The scope is from cradle to grave, by considering three end-of-life management options: incineration (I), reactivation (R), and landfilling (L). The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis, and CO2 adsorption capacity, were integrated into this study. The Simapro software was applied to the LCA analysis. Our result shows that AC, ACNH400, ACNH800, and G had CO2 adsorption capacities of 2.98, 1.10, 3.22, and 7.19 mmol/g, respectively. Meanwhile, the manufacturing processes of AC, ACNH400, ACNH800, and G contributed to 30â€“73%, 37â€“68%, 21â€“39%, and 80â€“97% of each environmental impact category, which were mostly related to energy consumption. Marine aquatic ecotoxicity (MAE) exhibited the largest environmental consequences (74â€“86%) across all adsorbents, followed by freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity (FWAE). Graphene, ACNH400, ACNH800, and AC had average energy consumption of 22500, 2200, 3400, and 800 MJ/kg, respectively. TOPSIS was used to select the optimal option from a variety of perspectives. The AC is the most sustainable option for capturing CO2. Accordingly, the rank of the options was followed as: AC-L &gt; AC-R &gt; AC-I &gt; ACNH400-R &gt; ACNH800-L &gt; ACNH800-R &gt; ACNH400-L &gt; ACNH800-I &gt; ACNH400-I &gt; G-L &gt; G-I &gt; G-R. Variations in electricity and HCl resulted in considerable changes in the LCA and LCC outputs, according to sensitivity analysis. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

A closer and better-structured industry/university partnership is required to deal with the issue of capability development. All of the universities in the UK engaged in oil- and gas-related degree programs reported greatly increased difficulties in securing meaningful projects or research/dissertation topics for delivery in 2009.

TI  - GA-based offshore helideck design considering manufacturability and buckling safety
AB  - A helideck is an essential structure in offshore platforms for the transportation of personnel and goods between the land and offshore sites; therefore, the overall processes from the design to the installation should be conducted carefully to ensure the safety of the platform. This article discusses an optimal structural design of a cantilever-type offshore helideck based on a genetic algorithm (GA) considering its manufacturability and buckling safety. Because helidecks are not mass-produced structures, they are assembled from the ready-made products of structural steel. Therefore, the design variable sets in the GA optimization were efficiently limited to the standard products in the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) code using the attainable design set concept. In addition, owing to the nature of the offshore industry, offshore structures are designed conservatively, complying with the classification regulations. Thus, both the maximum allowable stress and unity values were precisely checked during the optimization. Furthermore, both linear and nonlinear buckling analyses were performed to check the dynamic stability of the optimal design.

TI  - The modelling and three-level control of a hybrid propulsion system for a green ice-capable ship
AB  - The decreasing of Arctic sea ice provides opportunities for commercial shipping between Asia and Europe due to its shorter distance. However, the Arctic environment is vulnerable to the pollutants from shipping activities. Therefore, it is important to consider the impacts of shipping activities in the Northern Sea Route (NSR), especially with a view to the possibility of reducing emissions of short-lived pollutants. In this paper, modelling of a hybrid propulsion system is conducted and implemented in Matlab Simulink. A 3-level control strategy with efficiency of power sources taken into consideration, is applied to ensure stability of voltage and frequency, as well as reducing the pollutants through minimizing the fuel consumption. A target journey with specific loading condition, which is related to NSR shipping, has been conducted to test the performance of the hybrid propulsion system with the 3-level control strategy and diesel electric system, the simulation results of the hybrid propulsion system applied with the three-level control strategy in this research can offer up to 22.7\% fuel savings compared with a DC diesel electric system over a typical operating cycle. This justifies the use of hybrid propulsion as a more environmentally friendly propulsion system for the future ice-capable ships in the NSR. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to find the main factors, which influence fuel consumption. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Thorough conversion of CO2 through two-step accelerated mineral carbonation in the MgCl2-CaCl2-H2O system
AB  - This study describes a two-step accelerated mineral carbonation technology at moderate temperatures and atmospheric pressure by choosing the ``problematic ions for seawater utilization{''} as mineralizers in the simplified seawater-MgCl2-CaCl2-H2O system, that is, Ca2+ as the first mineralizer and Mg2+ in the residual solution as the second. Not only can carbonate ions generated from the absorption and ionization of CO2 be fixed by Ca2+ through the first carbonation process with the added alkali source, MgO, but HCO3- in the residual solution can also be mineralized by Mg2+ through the second carbonation process. Meanwhile, pure CaCO3 and MgCO3 center dot 3H(2)O, which have the possible benefit of reuse, can be obtained as by-products. Then, more variables were set to optimize the technical conditions to enhance the decalcification rate and carbon sequestration ratio, reduce the reaction time during the first mineralization and attempt to realize the combination of HCO3- and Mg2+ by adding NaOH to produce MgCO3 center dot 3H(2)O as another by-product in a moderate environment during the second mineralization.

TI  - Negative emissions-Part 2: Costs, potentials and side effects
AB  - The most recent IPCC assessment has shown an important role for negative emissions technologies (NETs) in limiting global warming to 2 degrees C cost-effectively. However, a bottom-up, systematic, reproducible, and transparent literature assessment of the different options to remove CO2 from the atmosphere is currently missing. In part 1 of this three-part review on NETs, we assemble a comprehensive set of the relevant literature so far published, focusing on seven technologies: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), afforestation and reforestation, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering, ocean fertilisation, biochar, and soil carbon sequestration. In this part, part 2 of the review, we present estimates of costs, potentials, and side-effects for these technologies, and qualify them with the authors' assessment. Part 3 reviews the innovation and scaling challenges that must be addressed to realise NETs deployment as a viable climate mitigation strategy. Based on a systematic review of the literature, our best estimates for sustainable global NET potentials in 2050 are 0.5-3.6 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for afforestation and reforestation, 0.5-5GtCO(2) yr(-1) for BECCS, 0.5-2GtCO(2) yr(-1) for biochar, 2-4 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for enhanced weathering, 0.5-5 GtCO(2) yr(-1) for DACCS, and up to 5GtCO(2) yr(-1) for soil carbon sequestration. Costs vary widely across the technologies, as do their permanency and cumulative potentials beyond 2050. It is unlikely that a single NET will be able to sustainably meet the rates of carbon uptake described in integrated assessment pathways consistent with 1.5 degrees C of global warming.

TI  - Climate change vis-a-vis saline agriculture: Impact and adaptation strategies
AB  - During the last two decades, the world has recognized that the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases (GHGs), namely, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), have increased markedly as a result of human activities. During pre-industrial era (1750 AD), their concentrations were 280 ppm, 715 ppb and 270 ppb, respectively, and these values have increased to 385 ppm, 1797 ppb and 322 ppb, respectively, in 2008. Increase in atmospheric CO2 promotes growth and productivity of plants with C3 photosynthetic pathway, but the increase in temperature, on the other hand, can reduce crop duration, increase crop respiration rates, affect the survival and distribution of pest populations and may hasten nutrient mineralization in soil, decrease fertilizer use efficiency and increase evapotranspiration and soil salinity. The water resources which are already scarce may come under enhanced stress. In the scenario of sea-level rise due to climate change, the inundated area with sea water will increase influencing the crop production due to higher salinity. Thus, the impact of climate change is likely to have a significant influence on agriculture and eventually on the food security and livelihoods of a large section of the rural population. There are evidences of negative impacts on yield of crops with variable magnitude in diverse ecologies including soil salinity and waterlogging particularly in the developing countries. Adaptation strategies and mitigation through perennial cropping systems such as agroforestry can be the main approach in handling climate change and salinity-related problems. Upscaling of modern technologies such as conservation and smart agriculture, judicious utilization of available water (including poorquality water) for agriculture through micro-irrigation and water-saving technologies, developing multiple stress-tolerant crops through molecular biological tools, restoration of degraded soils and waters, promoting carbon sequestration preferably through efficient agroforestry practices and conservation of biodiversity should be promoted at regional and country level. We need to formulate both short-term and long-term policies for improvement, sustenance and protection of natural resources. There is a need of capacity building and international collaboration in developing database for efficient weather forecasting and handling salinity-related problems and preparing contingency plans for vulnerable areas. The objectives of this paper are to summarize the information available on the mitigation options and adaptation strategies for climate change and rehabilitation of saline and waterlogged habitats to meet the food security especially in India.

TI  - Sizing and operation of a hybrid energy plant composed of industrial gas turbines, renewable energy systems and energy storage technologies
AB  - Hybrid energy plants, which include both fossil fuel technologies and renewable energy systems, can provide an important step towards a sustainable energy supply. In fact, the hybridization of renewable energy systems with gas turbines which are fed by fossil fuels allows an acceptable compromise, so that high fossil fuel efficiency and high share of renewables can be potentially achieved. Moreover, electrical and thermal energy storage systems increase the flexibility of the energy plant and effectively manage the variability of energy production and demand. This paper investigates the optimal sizing of a hybrid energy plant which combines an industrial gas turbine, renewable energy systems and energy storage technologies. The considered renewable energy system is a photovoltaic system, while the energy storage technologies are electrical energy storage and thermal energy storage. Moreover, a compression chiller and a gas boiler are also considered. For this purpose, the load profiles of electricity, heating and cooling during a whole year are taken into account for the case study of the Campus of the University of Parma (Italy). The sizing optimization problem of the different technologies composing the hybrid energy plant is solved by using a genetic algorithm, with the goal of minimizing primary energy consumption. Moreover, different operation strategies are analyzed and compared so that plant operation is also optimized. The results demonstrate that the optimal sizing of the hybrid energy plant, coupled with the optimized operation strategy, allows high average cogeneration efficiency (up to 84 %), thus minimizing primary energy consumption.

AB  - Tough lightweight fiber systems combined with carbon fiber and preform framing are allowing for new innovations in durable lightweight boat structures for US Navy Combatant Craft. Designs utilizing this new technology offer weight savings potential of 40% to 60% when compared to conventional construction. Combining structural weight savings with innovations in lightweight propulsion technology has a synergistic effect. The result is platforms that are substantially lighter and offer greater fuel efficiency and improved performance. The results of two on-going Navy research projects will be presented. The projects are a Phase II SBIR and Phase III (Defense Logistics Agency) effort. In these efforts a low cost, lower risk variant of a 7M RHIB and 8.5 M RHIB design will be developed, produced and evaluated. The Phase II Option and the Phase III effort provide funding for the development, construction and evaluation of two advanced lightweight designs. Both the low cost and advanced designs feature a lightweight membrane hull laminate and suspended cockpit. The single skin membrane structure reduces weight and absorbs wave impact energy though panel deflection. The suspended cockpit further mitigates shock due to wave impact as the deck is allowed to move relative to the hull. The project also provides for research into the effects of pressurizing the hull to deck cavity. We will assess the ability of pressure to support the hull and to enhance shock mitigation. The results of this ongoing project will be presented.

TI  - A self-powered and self-functional tracking system based on triboelectric-electromagnetic hybridized blue energy harvesting module
AB  - The position tracking and attitude monitoring are essential for marine equipment's survival in the boundless ocean. The power solution for aforementioned monitoring system became the bottleneck once its own equipped traditional battery pack run out of the power. Hence, a self-powered and self-functional tracking system has been proposed to meet the technique gap, which consists of a triboelectric-functioned inertial module and an electromagnetic powered global position system (GPS) module. A sophisticated-designed rotating gyro structure, together with triboelectric-electromagnetic working principal, established a battery-less tracking system successfully. Specially, the remarkable gyro rolling mode solution of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) features its sensitivity, multiple directions and robustness. Finally, the triboelectric-electromagnetic hybridized module was well validated in an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the Huanghai Sea. This work not only provides an effective and sustainable way toward large-scale blue energy scavenging, but also reveals TENG0 promising potential on inertial sensing capability for marine equipment.

AB  - Artificial upwelling, as a geoengineering tool, has received worldwide attention because it may actualize ocean fertilization in a sustainable way, which could potentially alleviate the pressures on the fish stocks and human-driven climate change in the ocean. We reviewed the current knowledge on the development of an artificial upwelling system and its potential environmental effects. Special attention was given to the research progress on the air-lift concept artificial upwelling by Zhejiang University. The research on artificial upwelling over the past few decades has generated a range of devices that have been successfully applied in the field for months. Based on field experiments and the associated modeling results, part of them reported positive effects on increasing primary production and enhancing CO2 sequestration. However, as a significant disturbance to the environment, especially for large-scale applications, the uncertainties related to the potential effects on ecosystem remain unsolved. Zhejiang University has overcome the technical challenges in designing and fabricating a robust and high efficiency artificial upwelling device which has been examined in two field experiments in Qiandao Lake and one sea trial in the East China Sea. It was investigated that cold and hypoxic deep ocean water (DOW) could be uplifted to the euphotic layer, which could potentially change the nutrient distribution and adjust the N/P ratio. Both simulation and field experiments results confirmed that utilizing self-powered energy to inject compressed air to uplift DOW was a valid and efficient method. Therefore, further field-based research on artificial upwelling, especially for long-term field research is required to test the scientific hypothesis.

For the first time in an affiliate, CLOV conducted an 18-month training program in Angola divided in 3 steps: An intensive English course (3 months), a scientific refresher course (2 months) and the upstream operators certification (13 months) in cooperation with Institut Francais du Petrole (IFP). This part-time training was divided into 22 weeks of scientific and technical courses and 18 weeks of "on the job training" meaning offshore training onboard FPSO. During all the period, numerous dedicated trainers from IFP and from Total E&P Angola were involved to supervise the trainees and interact with them. At the end of this program, trainees were selected and certified as upstream operators and hired by Total E&P Angola. Then they attended a "specific training" for CLOV. This new phase lasted 5 weeks during which the new operators had theoretical courses on CLOV facilities and hands-on exercises with a 3D tool, the Immersive Training Simulator (ITS). This ITS allowed them to familiarise with CLOV FPSO facilities and process, not yet achieved at that date. Then, the new operators were sent in Korea to participate in the commissioning activities before the FPSO sail away. They continued their training onboard Block 17 FPSOs in Angola during the FPSO tow and came back onboard at the arrival of CLOV FPSO in Angola to prepare the first oil. They are now professional operators for CLOV. This complete training program currently being deployed in Total affiliates will allow graduate operators with a 2 years diploma, to strengthen skills of local workforce and to build a win-win partnership with the country.

TI  - Seagrass Organic Carbon Stocks Show Minimal Variation Over Short Time Scales in a Heterogeneous Subtropical Seascape
AB  - Blue carbon initiatives require accurate monitoring of carbon stocks. We examined sources of variability in seagrass organic carbon (C-org) stocks, contrasting spatial with short temporal scales. Seagrass morphology and sediment C-org stocks were measured from biomass and shallow sediment cores collected in Moreton Bay, Australia. Samples were collected between 2012 and 2013, from a total of 77 sites that spanned a gradient of water turbidity. Environmental measures of water quality between 2000 and 2013 revealed strong seasonal fluctuations from summer to winter, yet seagrass biomass exhibited no temporal variation. There was no temporal variability in C-org stocks, other than below ground biomass stocks were slightly higher in June 2013. Seagrass locations were grouped into riverine, coastal, and seagrass loss locations and short temporal variability of C-org stocks was analysed within these categories to provide clearer insights into temporal patterns. Above ground C-org stocks were similar between coastal and riverine meadows. Below ground C-org stocks were highest in coastal meadows, followed by riverine meadows. Sediment C-org stocks within riverine meadows were much higher than at coastal meadows and areas of seagrass loss, with no difference in sediment C-org stocks between these last two categories. Riverine seagrass meadows, of higher turbidity, had greater total C-org stocks than meadows in offshore areas irrespective of time. We suggest that C-org stock assessment should prioritise sampling over spatial gradients, but repeated monitoring over short time scales is less likely to be warranted if environmental conditions remain stable.

TI  - Development of arctic ocean CO2 sink under rapid arctic change [å¿«é€Ÿå˜åŒ–ä¸­åŒ—å†°æ´‹ CO2 æ±‡ç ”ç©¶è¿›å±•]
AB  - The Arctic Ocean is a high latitude ocean that is also an important CO2 sink. Its climate and environment are undergoing rapid changes, modifying and increasing the uncertainties associated with its CO2 absorption capacity. The partial pressure of CO2 in the surface seawater (pCO2) is an important indicator of CO2 absorption capacity. Its distribution across the Arctic Ocean varies. The factors controlling pCO2 distribution are becoming more complex as a result of the rapid changes in the Arctic Ocean. We reviewed current international research on the present Arctic Ocean carbon sink and the associated uncertainties. We summarized the temporal and spatial distributions of pCO2 over the Arctic Ocean and identified the main factors controlling rapid changes in pCO2 distribution. As a result of the rapid changes in the Arctic, the processes and mechanisms of the marine biogeochemical carbon cycle in the Arctic Ocean have also become more complicated, affecting the CO2 absorption capacity of the Arctic Ocean. Current research shows that with the rapid retreat of sea ice, the Arctic Ocean has gradually strengthened into an important CO2 sink in the last two decades. The latest research estimated that the Arctic Ocean CO2 uptake can be as high as 180 TgCÂ·aâˆ’1 (1 Tg=1012 g), with the Chukchi Sea shelf accounting for almost one-third of the total uptake. The Arctic Ocean carbon sink is forecasted to grow in the future. However, actual CO2 uptake will be lower than estimated, owing to the effects of nutrient supply, surface seawater warming and ocean acidification. Â© 2020 Editorial Office of Polar Research.

TI  - Conceptual design of multi-source CCS pipeline transportation network for Polish energy sector
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify an optimal CCS transport infrastructure for Polish energy sector in regards of selected European Commission Energy Roadmap 2050 scenario. The work covers identification of the offshore storage site location, CO2 pipeline network design and sizing for deployment at a national scale along with CAPEX analysis. It was conducted for the worst-case scenario, wherein the power plants operate under full-load conditions. The input data for the evaluation of CO2 flow rates (flue gas composition) were taken from the selected cogeneration plant with the maximum electric capacity of 620 MW and the results were extrapolated from these data given the power outputs of the remaining units. A graph search algorithm was employed to estimate pipeline infrastructure costs to transport 95 MT of CO2 annually, which amount to about 612.6 M(sic). Additional pipeline infrastructure costs will have to be incurred after 9 years of operation of the system due to limited storage site capacity. The results show that CAPEX estimates for CO2 pipeline infrastructure cannot be relied on natural gas infrastructure data, since both systems exhibit differences in pipe wall thickness that affects material cost.

TI  - Assessing Carbon Stock and Sequestration of the Tropical Seagrass Meadows in Indonesia
AB  - Seagrass meadows provide critical ecosystem services for coastal areas, e.g., as nursery habitats for various fish species, help with water filtration of suspended sediment, and provide food for dugongs (Dugong dugon). Their role as â€œblue carbonâ€ and their capacity to mitigate climate change, by means of Natural mechanism of Carbon Dioxide Removal (NCDR) from the atmosphere, has recently gained increased attention. However, available scientific methods such as guidelines and manuals to measure carbon stock and sequestration still rely heavily on field sampling activities and laboratory analyses. Despite their accuracy, neither of these methods are applicable for large-scale carbon inventories nor are they practical in areas with limited carbon-related data and laboratory resources. Thus, it is necessary to determine whether any of the seagrass-related variables (e.g., coverage, density and biomass) may be treated as a proxy that are both robust and practical to assess the capacity of seagrass to store and sequester carbon. We developed formulas, assessed their robustness, and used both the formulas and the proxy to estimate carbon stock and the sequestration potential of the seagrasses. Furthermore, this study aims to elucidate the carbon stock and sequestration potential capacity of the seagrass ecosystems in Indonesia. We used the data of seagrass- and carbon-related variables obtained from eleven study sites and developed several candidate formulas using the Robust Linear Mixed Models (rL MMs). We found that the best formulas are comprised of multiple seagrass-related variables that consistently include biomass and coverage. This suggests that a combination of biomass and coverage is the best proxy to estimate carbon stock; however, a single proxy of seagrass coverage is recommended for practical seagrass monitoring purposes by the local government. Estimations of carbon stock and sequestration subsequently follow the formulas in the present study. Here we estimated, using a single proxy of seagrass coverage, that the above- and below-ground carbon stock, and carbon sequestration capacity of seagrass ecosystems in Indonesia reached 80â€“314 ktC, 196â€“696 ktC, and 1.6â€“7.4 MtC/year, respectively.

TI  - The effect of ocean acidification on carbon storage and sequestration in seagrass beds; a global and UK context
AB  - Ocean acidification will have many negative consequences for marine organisms and ecosystems, leading to a decline in many ecosystem services provided by the marine environment. This study reviews the effect of ocean acidification (OA) on seagrasses, assessing how this may affect their capacity to sequester carbon in the future and providing an economic valuation of these changes. If ocean acidification leads to a significant increase in above- and below-ground biomass, the capacity of seagrass to sequester carbon will be significantly increased. The associated value of this increase in sequestration capacity is approximately Â£500 and 600 billion globally between 2010 and 2100. A proportionally similar increase in carbon sequestration value was found for the UK. This study highlights one of the few positive stories for ocean acidification and underlines that sustainable management of seagrasses is critical to avoid their continued degradation and loss of carbon sequestration capacity.

TI  - Radioactive monitoring of offshore nuclear power stations
AB  - As the fossil fuel shortage deepens, the role of nuclear energy in the electrical power structure of the world must increase. To date, all nuclear power stations have been constructed on land. However, plans for siting such facilities on the Inner Continental Shelves are well advanced. Among parameters pertinent to site selection are myraid environmental concerns, including radiation monitoring. This paper describes new underwater instrumentation designed to measure radioactive components in the surficial marine sediments. The instruments consist of (1) a rapid bottom scanning device, which detects gross gamma radiation on the seafloor; (2) a static detector for specific isotope identification which is lowered to the seafloor while on station and (3) a shipboard analysis system for data retrieval and processing. To date, these instruments have been field tested in investigations of naturally-occurring radioactivity associated with heavy mineral sands and marine phosphorites. The same equipment can be used for evaluations of offshore nuclear power station sites prior to construction as well as for routine monitoring during plant operations.

TI  - Permeability prediction in the South Georgia rift basinâ€“applications to CO2 storage and regional tectonics
AB  - Absence of a permeability log necessary to assess reservoir quality and injectivity for potential CO2 storage in the heterogeneous and complex South Georgia Rift (SGR) basin provides the motivation for this study. The focus of this study was on the Triassic-Jurassic red beds buried, entrenched beneath the Cretaceous-Cenozoic Coastal Plain sediments. Moreover, the significant cost typically between $10Â M and $100Â M associated with drilling and logging for in situ permeability coupled with the limited resolution of existing core data further makes this work necessary. The purpose is to relate, use the interpretation of the predicted permeability distribution to assess feasibility for safe and long-term CO2 sequestration. This study also intends to establish the impacts of active and passive tectonism that has shaped and/or re-shaped the evolution of the basin on the present-day permeability. A methodology was applied that utilizes the pore space and geohydraulic properties of the reservoir from existing laboratory and well data to produce a newly derived permeability log. It shows a non-uniform distribution with depths possibly due to geologic changes in the confined and heterogeneous red beds. The derived log displays characteristics consistent with observations from the porosity and resistivity logs. The interpretation of these logs provides evidence for the presence of low permeable, tightly cemented, and compacted red beds. We conclude that the low permeability aided by the low resistivity depicted in the red beds suggests increased confining stress and reduced injectivity, and that the uncharacteristically low permeability reflects a deformed basin shaped with episodes of uplift and erosion.

TI  - Blue carbon as a natural climate solution
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), including mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal marshes, store carbon and provide co-benefits such as coastal protection and fisheries enhancement. Blue carbon sequestration has therefore been suggested as a natural climate solution. In this Review, we examine the potential for BCEs to act as carbon sinks and the opportunities to protect or restore ecosystems for this function. Globally, BCEs are calculated to store >30,000 Tg C across similar to 185 million ha, with their conservation potentially avoiding emissions of 304 (141-466) Tg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) per year. Potential BCE restoration has been estimated in the range of 0.2-3.2 million ha for tidal marshes, 8.3-25.4 million ha for seagrasses and 9-13 million ha for mangroves, which could draw down an additional 841 (621-1,064) Tg CO(2)e per year by 2030, collectively amounting to similar to 3\% of global emissions (based on 2019 and 2020 global annual fossil fuel emissions). Mangrove protection and/or restoration could provide the greatest carbon-related benefits, but better understanding of other BCEs is needed. BCE destruction is unlikely to stop fully, and not all losses can be restored. However, engineering and planning for coastal protection offer opportunities for protection and restoration, especially through valuing co-benefits. BCE prioritization is potentially a cost-effective and scalable natural climate solution, but there are still barriers to overcome before blue carbon project adoption will become widespread.

TI  - Reconversion of offshore oil and gas platforms into renewable energy sites production: Assessment of different scenarios
AB  - The contemporary energy transition will be characterized by many sub-transitions in the next three decades. Oil and gas will continue to play a very important role coupled with renewable energy sources in an energy mix scenario. In this context, the authors of the present work developed a project, named RELife (Renewable Energy for a new Life of offshore platforms), with the main goal of develop a model for the reuse of offshore Oil & Gas platforms at end-of-life stage for the production of renewable energy. In this paper, by considering two types of platforms (4-legged platform with 3 or 4 production wells), various technical scenarios are studied and investigated and for each scenario also the environmental and economic feasibility is evaluated. In addition, all the sub-models are compared with a standard decommissioning process. The evaluations are made for both the Adriatic Sea and the North Sea, two geographic areas with different availabilities of renewable resources. In order to assess also the economic and environmental feasibility, a Discount Cash Flow Analysis and a Life Cycle Assessment of all the scenarios have been conducted. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Engineering Multilevel Collaborative Catalytic Interfaces with Multifunctional Iron Sites Enabling High-Performance Real Seawater Splitting
AB  - Given the abundant reserves of seawater and the scarcity of freshwater, real seawater electrolysis is a more economically appealing technology for hydrogen production relative to orthodox freshwater electrolysis. However, this technology is greatly precluded by the undesirable chlorine oxidation reaction and severe chloride corrosion at the anode, further restricting the catalytic efficiency of overall seawater splitting. Herein, a feasible strategy by engineering multifunctional collaborative catalytic interfaces is reported to develop porous metal nitride/phosphide heterostructure arrays anchoring on conductive Ni2P surfaces with affluent iron sites. Collaborative catalytic interfaces among iron phosphide, bimetallic nitride, and porous Ni2P supports play a positive role in improving water adsorption/dissociation and hydrogen adsorption behaviors of active Fe sites evidenced by theoretical calculations for hydrogen evolution reactions, and enhancing oxygenated species adsorption and nitrate-rich passivating layers resistant to chloride corrosion for oxygen evolution reaction, thus cooperatively propelling high-performance bifunctional seawater splitting. The resultant material Fe2P/Ni1.5Co1.5N/Ni2P performs excellently as a self-standing bifunctional catalyst for alkaline seawater splitting. It requires extremely low cell voltages of 1.624 and 1.742 V to afford current densities of 100 and 500 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH seawater electrolytes, respectively, along with superior long-term stability, outperforming nearly all the ever-reported non-noble bifunctional electrocatalysts and benchmark Pt/IrO2 coupled electrodes for freshwater/seawater electrolysis. This work presents an effective strategy for greatly enhancing the catalytic efficiency of non-noble catalysts toward green hydrogen production from seawater electrolysis.

TI  - Electrochemical carbon dioxide capture to close the carbon cycle
AB  - Electrochemical CO2 capture technologies are gaining attention due to their flexibility, their ability to address decentralized emissions (e.g., ocean and atmosphere) and their fit in an electrified industry. In the present work, recent progress made in electrochemical CO2 capture is reviewed. The majority of these methods rely on the concept of ``pH-swing{''} and the effect it has on the CO2 hydration/dehydration equilibrium. Through a pH-swing, CO2 can be captured and recovered by shifting the pH of a working fluid between acidic and basic pH. Such swing can be applied electrochemically through electrolysis, bipolar membrane electrodialysis, reversible redox reactions and capacitive deionization. In this review, we summarize main parameters governing these electrochemical pH-swing processes and put the concept in the framework of available worldwide capture technologies. We analyse the energy efficiency and consumption of such systems, and provide recommendations for further improvements. Although electrochemical CO2 capture technologies are rather costly compared to the amine based capture, they can be particularly interesting if more affordable renewable electricity and materials (e.g., electrode and membranes) become widely available. Furthermore, electrochemical methods have the ability to (directly) convert the captured CO2 to value added chemicals and fuels, and hence prepare for a fully electrified circular carbon economy.

TI  - Assessing the influence of ocean acidification to marine amphipods: A comparative study
AB  - CO2 increases in the ocean may occur both by the capacity of CO2 exchanges with its dissolved form between atmosphere and surface seawater as well by CO2 leaks during the carbon capture and storage (CCS) process. The decrease in seawater pH may result in a reduction in the concentration of both hydroxide and carbonate (OHâ€“ and CO3 2Â âˆ’). The main aim of this work is to conduct an ecotoxicology comparative survey using two amphipod species from Europe and Brazil exposed to different acidification (CO2) scenarios. For it, an integrative approach based on the weight of evidence was used for comparative proposes to identify the effects on the amphipods association with the acidification and with the related mobility of metals. The results demonstrate that the Ampelisca brevicornis species is more sensitive to pH reductions than the Hyale youngi species. Furthermore, this study has demonstrated that the CO2 enrichment in aquatic ecosystems would cause changes on the mobility of certain metals (Zn, Cu and As). The results of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that the dissolved Zn in overlying water was strongly correlated with the decrease in the pH and was associated with increased toxicity of the sediment to the exposed organisms, mainly for the A. brevicornis species from Spain. Nevertheless, similar results were found in relation to the mortality of amphipods in low pH values for all sediment tested. Concluding, it is highlighted the importance of comparative studies in different types of environment and improve the understood of the risks associated with the ocean acidification.

TI  - Experimental evidence for carbonate precipitation and CO2 degassing during sea ice formation
AB  - Chemical and stable carbon isotopic modifications during the freezing of artificial seawater were measured in four 4 m(3) tank incubations. Three of the four incubations were inoculated with a nonaxenic Antarctic diatom culture. The 18 days of freezing resulted in 25 to 27 cm thick ice sheets overlying the residual seawater. The ice phase was characterized by a decrease in temperature from -1.9 to -2.2 degreesC in the under-ice seawater down to -6.7 degreesC in the upper 4 cm of the ice sheet, with a concurrent increase in the salinity of the under-ice seawater and brine inclusions of the ice sheet as a result of physical concentration of major dissolved salts by expulsion from the solid ice matrix. Measurements of pH, total dissolved inorganic carbon (C-T) and its stable isotopic composition (delta(13)C(T)) all exhibited changes, which suggest minimal effect by biological activity during the experiment. A systematic drop in pH and salinity-normalized C-T by up to 0.37 pH(SWS) units and 376 mumol C kg(-1) respectively at the lowest temperature and highest salinity part of the ice sheet were coupled with an equally systematic C-13 enrichment of the C-T. Calculations based on the direct pH and C-T measurements indicated a steady increase in the in situ concentration of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2(aq)) with time and increasing salinity within the ice sheet, partly due to changes in the dissociation constants of carbonic acid in the low temperature-high salinity range within sea ice. The combined effects of temperature and salinity on the solubility of CO2 over the range of conditions encountered during this study was a slight net decrease in the equilibrium CO2(aq) concentration as a result of the salting-out overriding the increase in solubility with decreasing temperature. Hence, the increase in the in Situ CO2(aq) concentration lead to saturation or supersaturation of the brine inclusions in the ice sheet with respect to atmospheric pCO(2) (approximate to3.5 X 10(-4) atm). When all physico-chemical processes are considered, we expect CO2 degassing and carbonate mineral precipitation from the brine inclusions of the ice sheet, which were saturated or highly supersaturated with respect to both the anhydrous (calcite, aragonite, vaterite) and hydrated (ikaite) carbonate minerals.

TI  - Monitoring offshore reservoirs using 4D gravity and subsidence with improved tide corrections
AB  - Seafloor 4D gravity is used to monitor changes in the distribution of density within producing reservoirs. The highest sensitivity is obtained when tracking contacts between fluids with high density contrast, like gas-water, gas-oil, or CO2-water in injection sites. The detection of fluid movements provides valuable information on aquifer strengths, lateral compartmentalization and permeability. Seafloor subsidence is monitored in gravity surveys by means of an elaborate processing of seafloor pressure measurements. Subsidence is a required correction for the interpretation of gravity results, but it is in itself a valuable monitoring tool, sensitive to important reservoir and overburden properties. It directly relates to pressure depletion and lateral compartmentalization, and in some cases, it is a key factor for the safety of the installations. When combined, simultaneous measurements of 4D gravity and subsidence provide valuable information from the areas of the field far away from monitoring and production wells. A key step in the processing of both gravity and pressure data is correcting for ocean tides. Tides are monitored during the surveys by means of tide gauges, which are pressure sensors deployed at stable locations on the seafloor during the survey. In this study, we first introduce the principles of the technology utilized in offshore gravity and subsidence monitoring surveys. Secondly, we review a few published field cases from fields on the Norwegian continental shelf. We then discuss the possibility of using an alternative sensor technology for tide gauges with a potential positive impact in data quality. Â© 2016 SEG.

TI  - Installation of a DP system and adaptation of the reel barge Chickasaw for deep water pipelay
AB  - Recently enhanced to permit pipelaylng operations in water depths much greater than 1000 ft, the reel barge Chickasaw is now installing deep water pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico. Included in the modifications performed on the barge are the design and installation of a full function, dynamic positioning (DPI system specifically adapted for offshore pipelay. The capabilities and operational requirements of this new system are significantly different from the station keeping of drilling vessels and other traditional DP applications. A fixed, short radius stinger has also been constructed to provide the high, near vertical departure angles required in deep water. The pipe reel has been strengthened and its tension capacity more than doubled to support the increased weight of the pipe column at these depths. As offshore resources are discovered in increasingly deeper waters in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere, the capabilities of existing pipelay vessels are being exceeded. The offshore pipeline industry is faced with the need to improve the operating capabilities of existing vessels or undertake the construction of new vessels specifically designed for operation in very deep water. The barge conversion described hereinafter extends the Chickasaw's operating range and ability to lay small to medium diameter pipelines and perform vertical stab-in connections in water depths to 5000 ft. and beyond. The paper describes practical, cost effective modifications which greatly increase the deep water pipelay and operational capabilities of an existing reel vessel. Programs of this type can improve the industry's ability to use offshore resources in very deep waters. Â© 1995, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Environmental and operative impact of the electrification of a double-ended ferry
AB  - The increasing sensibility to the environment protection and emission reduction in the atmosphere is also influencing the maritime shipping. The more restrictive regulations on pollutants suggest the adoption of alternative onboard propulsion and energy generation systems. To this end, electrification is a promising solution for pollution reduction, giving some flexibility on the strategy to use for the onboard system. Moreover, a hybrid-electric system can be combined with the exploitation of green fuel, increasing the potential reduction of total emissions. However, the final efficiency, both in term of emission reduction and expected operative expenditure, is strongly influenced by the operative profile of the vessel. This is of utmost importance both in case of a newly designed vessel and in the retrofitting of an existing one. In the present work, the impact of electrification on a double-ended ferry is presented, taking into consideration the operative profile of the vessel derived from real navigation data.

TI  - Algal biofuels: impact significance and implications for EU multi-level governance
AB  - Recent years have witnessed significant worldwide growth in research into the production of algal biomass for fuel, food and food supplements, nutrient recovery from wastewater and feedstocks for chemical and pharmaceutical industries. While there appear to be considerable future benefits, especially in terms of sustainable low carbon energy biofuels, emerging evidence suggests that large-scale algal production could impose multiple negative environmental impacts. Pressing questions therefore concern the significance of these impacts and the adequacy of attendant governance arrangements in ensuring environmental protection. To examine these questions, a qualitative impact assessment methodology is utilised to review, identify and compare the significance of potential impacts from several different production scenarios. Our findings show that significance varies not only between open pond and photo bioreactor (PBR) processes but also between land-based, coastal and marine production sites. We then examine how well these impacts are currently regulated in one specific political context, namely the European Union (EU). Analysis of EU environmental governance reveals evidence of significant policy mismatches and gaps. Recommendations for the future multi-level governance of algal biofuel technologies in the EU and globally are given, along with suggestions for further scientific and policy research as part of a wider investigative agenda.

TI  - Cleanup of organic and inorganic wellbore deposits using microemulsion formulations: Laboratory development and field applications
AB  - Progressive reduction of the flow path of oil and/or gas in the near-wellbore region could cause a gradual decline in hydrocarbon production. The major parameters that influence the time-frame of this process are related to the properties of the crude oil and to the reservoir pressure and temperature. Failure to achieve expected well production could also occur, suddenly, after a well intervention or after the wellbore construction. In either case, changes in pressure, temperature, fluid composition, incompatibility of fluids and/or poor fluid-rock interaction can generate precipitation and deposits of asphaltenes and paraffins, scale formation, emulsions or sludge and wettability alteration. In general, traditional treatments do not target all possible causes of crude oil flow-path reduction at the same time, and a sequence of treatment fluids are pumped to clean up the multiple damages (e.g., treatment of organic deposits followed by an acid treatment to remove scale deposits). The long cleanup time and high volume of fluids used in a multi-step treatment could impact the economics of the projects, especially offshore. The present work discusses multifunctional treatments for production enhancement and flow assurance that can remove organic deposits (e.g., paraffins and asphaltenes), emulsion blockage, scale deposits and increase water-wet condition of the flow path surfaces in one step.

TI  - A comparison between low- and high-pressure injection dual-fuel modes of diesel-pilot-ignition ammonia combustion engines
AB  - Ammonia, as a carbon-free fuel, is drawing more and more attention due to its potential of decarbonization for marine engines. The dual-fuel mode that can compensate for the poor combustion properties of ammonia has exhibited some prospects for practical application, but more relevant researches are urgent to promote the carbon-free fuel, especially for the high-pressure injection dual-fuel (HPDF) mode. In this paper, the ammonia spray experiments under the diesel-like conditions are conducted using the high-speed photography to calibrate the spray sub-models. Then, the combustion and emission characteristics of the low- and high-pressure injection dual-fuel modes of diesel pilot-ignition ammonia combustion engines are numerically studied and compared. Particularly, the equivalent CO2 considering the global warming potential of CO2 and N2O are evaluated (i.e. CO2 + 300 Ã— N2O). The results show that the maximum ammonia ratio about 80% by energy is recommended for the low-pressure injection dual-fuel (LPDF) mode and further increase the diesel replacement ratio will increase the probability of misfire, while the HPDF mode has the potential to achieve a 97% diesel replacement ratio. Compared with the pure diesel mode, the HPDF mode has similar indicated thermal efficiency, cooling and exhaust loss, while it can significantly reduce the equivalent CO2 with little increase in the NH3 emissions. Owing to the reduced heat transfer loss, the LPDF mode has the potential to achieve a higher indicated thermal efficiency than the pure-diesel mode, but its ability to reduce the equivalent CO2 would be relatively limited because the significant increase of N2O emissions if exhaust after treatments were not employed. The comparison between the LPDF mode and HPDF mode shows that the former case has the potential to achieve a higher indicated thermal efficiency, while the latter case can significantly reduce the engine-out NH3, NOx and greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Numerical simulation for potential evaluation of carbon dioxide geological sequestration - A case study in Malay basin east off Malay Peninsula
AB  - At present, reduction of CO2 emission is required as a measure against global warming. CO2 geological sequestration is assumed to be a feasible answer to this issue in the future. We evaluated potentials of CO2 sequestration in Malay Basin in the South China Sea by numerical simulation on basin modeling. In Malay Basin, CO2 content within producing gas is very high, so that it will be an ideal CO2 sequestration system to inject the CO2 collected from local wells into the underground of high seal capacity, reducing a large amount of transportation cost and applying EOR (enhanced oil recovery) if needed. In this study, development of the Malay Basin was restored by numerical simulation, applying various geologic and geophysical information. A series of detailed physical properties at the present time was estimated through calibrations in porosity and vitrinite reflectance variations. Next, CO2 injection was numerically executed in the modeled reservoirs and its stability was examined. For the simulations on basin modeling and CO2 injection, a basin modeling software, Schlumberger PetroMod, was used. As a result of the simulation, it was found that CO2 sequestration was feasible in reservoirs at any target depth below 720 m, which is the supercritical phase boundary for CO2.

TI  - Seawater-pH measurements for ocean-acidification observations
AB  - The uptake of anthropogenic CO 2 by the oceans since the onset of the industrial revolution is considered a serious challenge to marine ecosystems due to ensuing carbonate-chemistry changes (ocean acidification). Furthermore, the CO 2 uptake is reducing the ocean's capacity to absorb future CO 2 emissions. In order to follow the changes in the ocean's carbonate system, high-quality analytical measurements with good spatial and temporal resolution are necessary. High-precision and accurate pH measurements are now possible, and allow us to determine the progression of ocean acidification. The spectrophotometric pH technique is now widely used and capable of the required high-quality measurements. Spectrophotometric pH systems are deployed on ships and in situ on remote platforms. Smaller and more rugged instruments are nevertheless required for more widespread in situ application to allow routine high-resolution measurements, even in the most remote regions.We critically review oceanic pH measurements, and focus on state-of-the-art spectrophotometric pH measurement techniques and instrumentation. We present a simple microfluidic design integrated in a shipboard instrument featuring high accuracy and precision as a key step towards a targeted pH microsensor system. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - More Environmental Sustainability Routing and Energy Management for All Electric Ships
AB  - With the popularity of the electrification of marine transportation, strategic energy-saving and environment-friendly management is gaining more attention recently. This paper proposes a novel coordinated navigation routing and power generation scheduling model, which aims at making a compromise between investment cost, operation cost, and greenhouse gas emissions under the distributional robust ambiguity of photovoltaic. A maritime hybrid energy configuration that combines diesel generator (DG), battery energy storage system (BESS), fuel cell (FC), photovoltaic (PV), and the cold-ironing connection is presented with a real-world navigation routine from Dalian to Singapore, and the optimization problem is solved through a bi-level tri-objective differential evolution algorithm, where navigation parameters, ESS and FC capacity and weight between operation cost and emission functions, are optimized in the upper level and specific power generation scheduling is settled in the lower level. Six case studies are conducted to verify its effectiveness and accuracy, and the simulation results demonstrate the proposed method can further reduce the operation cost while minimizing air contamination.

TI  - The marine carbon cycle and ocean carbon inventories
AB  - Carbon is a fundamental component of all life and its gaseous form, carbon dioxide (CO2), is an important atmospheric regulator of Earth's climate. Over societally relevant timescales, diverse physical, biological, and chemical processes in the global ocean have a very important role in controlling the exchanges of CO2 with the atmosphere and climate, given that the ocean contains roughly 60 times more carbon than the atmosphere. The complex and dynamic marine carbon cycle is thus a fundamental part and regulator of life on Earth, requiring monitoring of its variability and understanding of the feedbacks to the climate system. This is particularly relevant given that emissions of human produced (anthropogenic) CO2 through fossil fuel and land use changes have led to significant perturbations in the global carbon cycle. A large fraction of emitted anthropogenic carbon (Cant) has been and will be absorbed by the oceans with implications for seawater chemistry, ocean pH levels, and the biological communities contained within. During the last few decades, quantification of the ocean sink of CO2 and its temporal evolution of the marine carbon cycle has been an important driver of marine biogeochemical research. Scientific expeditions such as the World Ocean Circulation Experiment/Joint Global Ocean Flux Study global surveys conducted during the 1990s provided the data for the first global estimates of the uptake and oceanic sink of Cant. More recently, completion of a second global survey of the marine carbon cycle (from 2000 to 2013) provided sufficient data to assess the rate of uptake and storage of Cant within the interior of the global ocean. From this effort, it has become clear that there is substantial regional and temporal variability of the storage rate of Cant and those physico-biogeochemical processes that influence the marine carbon cycle. Here we review seawater carbonate chemistry, the sampling strategies, and networks required to observe variability in the global ocean carbon cycle and the flux of carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere but with a central focus, synthesizing and summarizing available estimates of the ocean uptake and inventories of Cant. This chapter is aimed at a wider audience within the oceanographic community and points to the rich literature on marine carbon cycle research. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Energy, exergy and economic analysis of offshore regasification systems
AB  - Energy, exergy and economic analysis are proposed herein to evaluate regasification systems in Floating Storage Regasification Units (FSRUs). Three regasification systems typical in these types of vessels are considered: seawater system, open loop propane system and closed loop water-glycol system. The energy and exergy analyses were performed using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES), while Suite AspenONE programmes were used for the economic assessment. The exergy analysis provides a better understanding of the components of physical exergy (thermal and mechanical exergy) in order to define an exergy efficiency applicable to any liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification system or FSRU. The results obtained prove the seawater regasification system to be most efficient from an energy and exergy standpoint. The specific energy consumption and exergy efficiency for this system are 227.33 kJ/kg and 50.00%, respectively. On the other hand, the open loop propane regasification system is most cost-effective for an LNG price between 1.32 and 11 USD/MMBtu. The vast amounts of destroyed exergy in the regasification process of current systems was also demonstrated and hence the need to develop new, more efficient configurations that could exploit the cold energy of LNG.

TI  - Estimating aboveground biomass and carbon stocks of mangrove forests in Kuala Sepetang, Perak
AB  - Tree biomass estimates and analyses are essential for carbon accounting and other feasibility studies including bioenergy. Forest including mangrove trees play an important role in ecosystems which could be addressing climate change and mitigation through biomass and carbon storage. A reasonable method for estimating tree biomass and carbon stocks are increasingly important due to concerns on global climate change and carbon sequestration. This study aims to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) of a mangrove trees in Kuala Sepetang using allometric model. A total of 16 compartments of mangrove were used to sample a 150 plots. Biomass and carbon stock by each plot and compartment were estimated. It was found that the average AGB for all sample plots were 168.93 t ha-1. The maximum value was 462.40 t ha-1 while the minimum value was 24.35 t ha-1 and a total AGB of the study plots was about 2,533.98 tonnes. The total value for carbon stock in 150 plots was 12,669.90 tC ha-1 while the average was 84.47 tC ha-1. The estimation of ABG was 1.8% more when compared to previous study by using destructive method. Thus, the allometric method is practical to estimate AGB. The advantage of the allometric method is the operation is simple at low cost. This method also could be done in a short of time and most accurate in forest plantations where trees are relatively uniform. Â© 2018 Forestry Department of Peninsular Malaysia. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of ocean acidification and high solar radiation on productivity and species composition of a late summer phytoplankton community of the coastal Western Antarctic Peninsula
AB  - The Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), one of the most productive regions of the Southern Ocean, is currently undergoing rapid environmental changes such as ocean acidification (OA) and increased daily irradiances from enhanced surface-water stratification. To assess the potential for future biological CO2 sequestration of this region, we incubated a natural phytoplankton assemblage from Ryder Bay, WAP, under a range of pCO(2) levels (180 mu atm, 450 mu atm, and 1000 mu atm) combined with either moderate or high natural solar radiation (MSR: 124 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and HSR: 435 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), respectively). The initial and final phytoplankton communities were numerically dominated by the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis antarctica, with the single cells initially being predominant and solitary and colonial cells reaching similar high abundances by the end. Only when communities were grown under ambient pCO(2) in conjunction with HSR did the small diatom Fragilariopsis pseudonana outcompete P. antarctica at the end of the experiment. Such positive light-dependent growth response of the diatom was, however, dampened by OA. These changes in community composition were caused by an enhanced photosensitivity of diatoms, especially F. pseudonana, under OA and HSR, reducing thereby their competitiveness toward P. antarctica. Moreover, community primary production (PP) of all treatments yielded similar high rates at the start and the end of the experiment, but with the main contributors shifting from initially large to small cells toward the end. Even though community PP of Ryder Bay phytoplankton was insensitive to the changes in light and CO2 availability, the observed size-dependent shift in productivity could, however, weaken the biological CO2 sequestration potential of this region in the future.

TI  - Estimation of biomass, carbon stocks and soil sequestration of Gowatr mangrove forests, Gulf of Oman
AB  - The mangrove forest ecosystem is known to possess a variety of ecosystem services, including high rates of carbon sequestration, storage and mitigating climate change through reduced deforestation. This study was carried out in the mangrove forests of Gowatr Bay, Gulf of Oman during 2017-18 to quantify biomass and carbon stocks of all components of this forest, including live and dead trees, soil, pneumatophores, herbaceous and litter in three stations during post-monsoon and pre-monsoon. We examined that biomass, carbon stocks and soil carbon varied significantly with spatial locations (p&lt;0.05) abut not with seasons (p&gt;0.05). The mean of biomass and carbon stock were estimated 125.54Â±19.31 and 129.21Â±19.64 Mg ha-1, and 48.48Â±7.51 and 49.9Â±7.5 Mg ha-1, in post-monsoon and pre-monsoon, respectively. Also, Soil carbon was determined 227.1Â±11.86 and 227.3Â±11.71 Mg ha-1 in post-monsoon and pre-monsoon, respectively. A positive correlation was found between the vegetation biomass and soil organic carbon in post-monsoon (r=0.905) and pre-monsoon (r=0.914), indicating the role of vegetation in building soil organic carbon. The mean carbon stock value for the total area of mangroves in post-monsoon and pre-monsoon was extrapolated as 43.9 and 44.2 Kt of C, equivalent to 161.13 and 162.102 Kt of CO2, respectively. This data reveals that Gowatr mangroves store a substantial amount of atmospheric carbon, and therefore need to be conserved and sustainably managed to maintain as well as to increase carbon storage.

TI  - Accurate new solutions for fluid sample contamination quantification, with special focus on water sampling in water-base mud
AB  - The role of formation testers has evolved significantly over the past decades. Early versions of this tool focused solely on obtaining pressure measurements and fluid samples. With advances in technology, the ability to measure fluid properties downhole at reservoir pressure and temperature has grown continuously. Today, formation tester downhole fluid analysis (DFA) and pressure measurements are routinely used to characterize fluids and address reservoir connectivity concerns in real time. However, quantitative use of fluid property measurements requires the user to measure- and correct for, as required-fluid contaminants caused by invaded mud filtrates. New measurements are combined with new algorithms to yield a harmonized contamination quantification solution that is applicable to all fluids and mud types. The quantification of drilling fluid content is at its most challenging when the formation fluids and drilling mud filtrate are fully miscible. Water-base mud (WBM) filtrate contamination measurement in formation water samples is particularly challenging because formation water and WBM filtrate exhibit very similar near-infrared optical spectroscopy signatures and are therefore difficult to differentiate. Native and invaded fluid typically do have measurably different live fluid density or resistivity. However, resistivity measurements should only be used if a temperature correction is applied. The general workflow for real-time hydrocarbon contamination quantification in oil-base mud (OBM) has been applied to water sampling in WBM, using live fluid density and resistivity measurements. First, a temperature correction is applied to the resistivity measurement and the data are converted to conductivity. Next, density- and temperature-corrected conductivity data are crossplotted and a novel linear relation is generated. The independently determined filtrate and formation water properties (endpoints) should fall on the extrapolated linear relation because this relation is intrinsic to the fluid mixture. Lastly, the fluid mixture measurements and endpoints are entered into mixing rules to calculate contamination. With this new method for quantifying water sample contamination, there is now a complete solution that is applicable to all fluid combinations. Several case studies of water sampling in WBM show the effectiveness of the new mud filtrate contamination quantification method. Copyright 2016, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Analyzing interdependencies between policy mixes and technological innovation systems: The case of offshore wind in Germany
AB  - One key approach for studying emerging technologies in the field of sustainability transitions is that of technological innovation systems (TIS). While most TIS studies aim at deriving policy recommendations - typically by identifying system barriers - the actual role of these proposed policies in the TIS is rarely looked at. In addition, often single policy instruments instead of more encompassing policy mixes are considered. We address these shortcomings by applying a more comprehensive policy mix concept within the TIS approach. In doing so we analyze interdependencies between the policy mix and the TIS by shedding light on the role of the policy mix for TIS functioning and performance as well as how TIS developments influence the evolution of the policy mix. We explore these interdependencies for the case of offshore wind in Germany, using data from event history analysis and expert interviews. We find highly dynamic interdependencies with reoccurring patterns of systemic problems and adjustments of the policy mix, which are fuelled by high policy mix credibility and supportive actors. Our study constitutes a first step incorporating the policy mix concept into the TIS approach, thereby enabling a better understanding of real dynamics occurring in TIS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Given solution supports renewables, as a platform's exploitation economy improvement. As a main current source in the proposed system, a fuel cell with high energy density to mass ratio (Wh/kg) is provided; however, it has disadvantages regarding its dynamic response during the load changes. The proposed solution minimises the disadvantages of the fuel cell by designing a hybrid system consisting few energy sources and storages with a logic system to control its elements. In order to optimise the hybrid system's configurations the author's concept has been applied. This concept models the set of energetic and dynamic characteristics called the energy profile in the considered floating platform's electric loads. Use of energy profiles in the system's configuration process allows minimisation of its size with constant power availability in all the floating platform's exploitation states.

TI  - Industrialization of new subsea chemical storage and injection systems
AB  - Subsea chemical storage and injection systems are a new technology that moves the chemical units from topside to subsea locations, close to the wells. It has been conceived for application on field development projects with long tiebacks, whenever the objective is to replace the expensive hydraulic umbilicals for chemicals distribution. Conversely, the new subsea technology needs only a power and communication link to the existing topside facilities. So that this can occur, a dedicated industrialisation programme was launched for developing all the building blocks of the technology to achieve a sufficient readiness level for the first industrial application. The core of the industrialisation has been the extensive qualification campaign, mostly based on experimental testing carried out in laboratory and workshop environments, as well as in simulated deepwater conditions. Due to the nature of the treated fluids, specific attention has been paid to the chemical compatibility testing of materials and fluids for long term applications in harsh environments. The available technologies have been reviewed through a comprehensive market assessment, to spotlight the gaps as well as the elements of novelty of the intended application. Several industrial partners have been engaged to jointly define and carry out relevant qualification plans. The basis of design for the development and qualification of equipment has been defined considering a range of possible applications in the subsea field development and subsea processing context. The information was used to build a map of the technology requirements including the chemical fluids to be managed, flowrate and injection pressure ranges. The map, combined with a set of process data and IMR scenarios, has been further elaborated to define the storage unit size, modularization philosophy and to set relevant reliability requirements. The qualification philosophy was based on the framework set by the international guidelines for technology qualification, i.e. DNV RP A203 and API 17 Q, through a documented risk-based approach. Whenever applicable, the components have been qualified to specific relevant standards, for instance API17 F and ISO 1817 for the electronic components and the effect of liquids on polymeric materials respectively. Programme execution included the construction of several prototypes of the key equipment: The subsea pump & motor unit, electrical actuator for small-bore valves, flowmeter and the storage unit. Most of the components were subject to endurance and cycle testing to provide quantitative data to support the results of the RAM analyses. In addition, the programme leveraged the control system components that have been industrialised as part of a previous qualification initiative addressing the requirements of several subsea processing applications. The paper will introduce the elements of technological novelty of the equipment and will describe the methodology, challenges and main results of the programme. The qualification activities will be completed by the end of 2020. Â© 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Sociotechnical Considerations About Ocean Carbon Dioxide Removal
AB  - Ocean carbon dioxide removal (OCDR) is rapidly attracting interest, as climate change is putting ecosystems at risk and endangering human communities globally. Due to the centrality of the ocean in the global carbon cycle, augmenting the carbon sequestration capacity of the ocean could be a powerful mechanism for the removal of legacy excess emissions. However, OCDR requires careful assessment due to the unique biophysical characteristics of the ocean and its centrality in the Earth system and many social systems. Using a sociotechnical system lens, this review identifies the sets of considerations that need to be included within robust assessments for OCDR decision-making. Specifically, it lays out the state of technical assessments of OCDR approaches along with key financial concerns, social issues (including public perceptions), and the underlying ethical debates and concerns that would need to be addressed if OCDR were to be deployed as a carbon dioxide removal strategy.

TI  - The carbon budget of the northern cryosphere region
AB  - The northern cryosphere is undergoing substantial warming of permafrost and loss of sea ice. Release of stored carbon to the atmosphere in response to this change has the potential to affect the global climate system. Studies indicate that the northern cryosphere has been not only a substantial sink for atmospheric CO2 in recent decades, but also an important source of CH4 because of emissions from wetlands and lakes. Analyses suggest that the sensitivity of the carbon cycle of the region over the 21st Century is potentially large, but highly uncertain because numerous pathways of response will be affected by warming. Further research should focus on sensitive elements of the carbon cycle such as the consequences of increased fire disturbance, permafrost degradation, and sea ice loss in the northern cryosphere region.

TI  - A study on the economic impact of emission reduction in the shipping industry
AB  - Concerning the maritime transportation industry, according to the International Maritime Organization (the United Nations' regulatory body to ensure that the shipping industry contribution in emissions' reductions is managed effectively) CO2 emissions have increased by almost 70 per cent in the last 25 years. As a result of the imminent threat, the European Commission together with the organizations concerned with the decrease of the pollution level and the control of the greenhouse gas emissions decided to regulate the system through the introduction of new threshold via legislative measures. The paper highlights the results of a doctoral research concerning ship owners attitudes towards sustainable strategies designed to meet the requirements of the new regulations imposed by the International Maritime Organization. The first objective is to reveal the relevant measures undertaken by shipowners to support the decrease in greenhouse gas and non-greenhouse gas emissions. The second objective concerns to what extent these measures might economically influence the organizations performance and which are the benefits of implementing the policy mechanisms within the current economic environment.

TI  - Application of controller performance assessment methods in a cogeneration power plant
AB  - Combined-cycle cogeneration power plants produce electricity with combustion turbine generators and steam from the exhaust heat with heat recovery steam boilers. The steam generated is used for heating, driving adsorption chillers for cooling, and drivign steam turbine generators to produce additional electricity. By capturing the waste heat, the fuel source is used more efficiently. With less fuel burned, fewer emissions are produced. The many benefits of cogeneration plants earn them recognition as a clean energy technology [I]. Because cogeneration plants must concurrently meet power, heating and cooling demands, the plant controls are rich with unique challenges. In particular, this study investigates the cogeneration plant at the University of Connecticut (UConn Cogen) which must meet the ever changing campus loads which fluctuate with the academic cycle and the New England climate without producing excess electricity because of grid regulations. As the demands and climate change, the plant must operate at a wide range of levels. UConn Cogen employs over 150 control loops to regulate and coordinate plant operation. The variation in the demands has multiple effects on the control loops. Nonlinearities in the unit operations and wear on the equipment can cause controller performance to degrade and reduce the efficiency of the plant. In this paper, we present a controller performance assessment method which is used to track controller behavior and identify underperforming loops. The key novel method is an automated adaption of the autocorrelation function (ACF). Without performing tests on the processes or waiting for large disruptions, the ACF tool uses regulatory (constant set point) data to classify the controller response patterns. The method not only identifies changes in controller performance, but also defines the manner in which the response has changed. Additionally, the ACF method includes a guide for retuning the controller to regain desired performance.

TI  - Beginning of the end
AB  - When Shellâ€™s 24,200-ton Brent Delta topsides is lifted IN 2017, it will be the heaviest lift ever conducted offshore using the worldâ€™s largest vessel by displacement. There has also been intense work to assess how to deal with the three massive gravity base structures (GBSs), and the 31,500-ton steel jacket. Shellâ€™s conclusion is that they would be best left in place, at least in part. Alternative uses, from offshore wind to carbon capture and storage, have also been assessed in detail. To remove the footings of the steel jacket would mean either boring down through the tops of the footings or excavating down through the seabed and doing a subsurface cut, followed by a lifting operation.

TI  - Modeling hybrid energy systems for marine applications: Hybrid electric ships
AB  - Nowadays, hybrid energy technologies are widely used for power generation in various transportation systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. In maritime transportation, due to the distance from the shore power system, there is a need for a stand-alone hybrid power system to meet the power demand and satisfy the environmental constraints of some ports. This study aims to model a hybrid shipboard power system (HSPS), which includes a diesel generator, renewable energy system (RES), energy storage system, electrical heat pump (EHP), and electrical boiler (EB) system to supply electrical and thermal demands of a cruise ship, simultaneously. It is noteworthy that the applied RES is composed of photovoltaic (PV) panels and a wind turbine (WT). In addition, the energy storage system includes both electrical and thermal storage to enhance the performance of the system. On the other hand, the connection facilities are also considered to connect the ship to the local power system during the stopping hours of the ship at the port to reduce the fuel consumption and emission arising from using diesel generators. Finally, the proposed HSPS has been implemented on a real ship to prove the effectiveness of the proposed structure in reducing fuel consumption, emission, and costs compared to other suggested structures.

TI  - A Novel Converter Control Strategy for a DFIM-Based Pumped Storage System in an Islanded Microgrid under Fault Conditions
AB  - As offshore wind power in microgrid has thrived over the years, Doubly-Fed-Induction-Machine (DFIM)-based pumped storage systems have been expected to provide ancillary service for such microgrid. However, the control strategy of a DFIM-based pumped storage system during a fault period has not yet been studied. This paper provides insights into the function of a pumped storage system in microgrid facing potential faulty events. A novel control strategy derived from the electromagnetic transient model of DFIM during a fault period is proposed. The proposed control strategy is accurate and flexible. It considers the relative importance of both the frequency and voltage variation during the fault period. The simulation results in dSPACE Simulator confirm that the proposed control improves the performance of the pumped storage system in microgrid. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Elastic properties of hydrate-bearing sandy sediment during CH4-CO2 replacement
AB  - CH4-CO2 replacement method can not only recover methane from natural gas hydrate, but also implement CO2 geological sequestration. The effect of CH4-CO2 replacement with gaseous or liquid CO2 from natural gas hydrates, and the stiffness evolution during the stages of CH4 hydrate formation, free methane gas release, gaseous or liquid CO2 flooding, and CH4-CO2 replacement were experimentally investigated by in situ measuring the compressional wave velocity of hydrate-bearing sediments. The measured results showed that the P-wave velocity and amplitude of the hydrate-bearing sediments behave in the same way and decrease slightly because of the dissociation of CH4 hydrate when free CH4 gas was released and CO2 gas was injected. At the stage of CH4-CO2 replacement, methane hydrate may be coated by newly-formed hydrate which prevents CH4 or CO2 molecules passing through. Both the P-wave velocity and the amplitude gradually decrease with the increase of replacement percentage owing to the different properties between CH4 hydrate and CO2 hydrate. The elastic modulus of hydrate-bearing sediments was found to decrease with the dissociation of CH4 hydrate and the formation of CO2 hydrate, indicating the CH4-CO2 replacement may weaken the rigidity of the sediment skeleton. However, the fluctuation of bulk stiffness is at a low level and the stiffness of hydrate-bearing sediments can still be maintained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Seasonal variation in nitrous oxide and methane emissions from subtropical estuary and coastal mangrove sediments, Australia
AB  - Mangrove sediments can act as sources of the greenhouse trace gases, nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Confident reporting of trace gas emissions from mangrove sediments at local levels is important for regional emissions inventories, since small changes in N2O and CH4 fluxes greatly influence greenhouse gas budgets due to their high global warming potentials. It is also important to identify the drivers of trace gas emission, to prioritise management for minimising emissions. We measured N2O and CH4 fluxes and abiotic sediment parameters at midday low tide in winter and summer seasons, at four sites (27Â°33'S, 152Â°59'E) ranging from estuary to ocean sub-tropical mangrove sediments, having varied anthropogenic impacts. At all sites, sediment N2O and CH4 emissions were significantly lower during winter (7-26 Î¼g N2O m-2.h-1; 47-466 Î¼g CH4 m-2.h-1) compared to summer (28-202 Î¼g N2O m-2.h-1; 247-1570 Î¼g CH4 m-2.h-1). Sediment temperature, ranging from 18 to 33 Â°C, strongly influenced N2O and CH4 emissions. Highest emissions (202 Î¼g N2O m-2.h-1, 1570 Î¼g CH4 m-2.h-1) were detected at human-impacted estuary sites, which generally had higher total carbon (&lt;8%) and total nitrogen (&lt;0.4%) in sediments and reduced salinity (&lt;16 dS.m-1). Large between-site variation highlights the need for regular monitoring of sub-tropical mangroves to capture short-lived, episodic N2O and CH4 flux events that are affected by sediment biophysico-chemical conditions at site level. This is important, particularly at sites receiving anthropogenic nutrients, and that have variable freshwater inputs and tidal hydrology.

TI  - Global technology learning and national policy-An incentive scheme for governments to assume the high cost of early deployment exemplified by Norway
AB  - In this paper it is argued that technology learning may be both a barrier and an incentive for technology change in the national energy system. The possibility to realize an ambitious global emission reduction scenario is enhanced by coordinated action between countries in national policy implementation. An indicator for coordinated action is suggested. Targeted measures to increase deployment of nascent energy technologies and increasing energy efficiency in a small open economy like Norway are examined. The measures are evaluated against a set of baselines with different levels of spillover of technology learning from the global market. It is found that implementation of technology subsidies increase the national contribution to early deployment independent of the level of spillover. In a special case with no spillover for offshore floating wind power and endogenous technology learning substantial subsidy or a learning rate of 20% is required. Combining the high learning rate and a national subsidy increases the contribution to early deployment. Enhanced building code on the other hand may reduce Norway's contribution to early deployment, and thus the realization of a global emission reduction scenario, unless sufficient electricity export capacity is assured.

TI  - A low-cost and effective seeding technique using protective core for restoration of Zostera marina habitats
AB  - In this study, a protective seed core method for planting seeds of the common eelgrass Zostera marina was developed and evaluated through laboratory and field experiments. We studied the suitable desiccation period of the protective seed cores, and their effect on seed germination and seedling establishment in a laboratory experiment. New patches established by seeds planted with the protective seed cores were evaluated through an 11-month-seed-sowing field experiment. Observations of the stability of the protective seed cores and the change in viability of Z. marina seeds placed in the protective seed cores demonstrated that the optimum desiccation period was 2 days. Seed germination and seedling establishment of Z. marina were promoted by the protective seed cores during the 90-day laboratory experiment. The field experiment showed that the seedling establishment of Z. marina seeds was significantly enhanced by the protective cores, ranging from 12\% to 64\%, with an average of 30\%, 6 months after seeding. New patches were successfully established by protective seed cores with a maximum shoot density of 367 shoots m(-2) 11 months after planting. The average planting cost per Z. marina seed was \$0.03; thus, \$14,820 would be incurred for planting 1 ha of Z. marina beds using this method. These results indicate that the protective seed core method is an efficient and cost-effective restoration technique with a potential in facilitating large-scale restoration projects.

TI  - The effects of including intricacies in the modelling of a small-scale solar-PV reverse osmosis desalination system
AB  - With the global demand for freshwater rising alongside the cost of power generation from fossil-based fuels, access to potable water in small (marginalised) or coastal communities can be alleviated using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind. Whilst large-scale renewably powered desalination systems have been the focus of much research, where smaller systems are concerned, there remains ambiguity as to the significance of modelling all system intricacies and the effects of Solar-Photovoltaics (solar-PV) scalability on total water yield.After detailing the methodology used to model such Reverse Osmosis (RO) systems, this paper presents the results of simulations used to investigate a small-scale, stand-alone, solar-PV powered (RO) system, with/without battery storage. Results indicate that system performance is affected differently when including power characteristics of RO devices and also by the temporal resolution used in simulations. The scale of the renewable energy conversion used (solar-PV) appears to be a factor in some cases. Parameters varied in the simulations include RO (unit) power characteristics, saline water concentration/temperature, PV panel power characteristics as well as the dynamic charging and discharging of batteries and the efficiency of power conditioning. Simulations are done using MATLAB and use laboratory-based data to establish device characteristics. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Allometric models to estimate above-ground biomass and carbon stocks in Rhizophora apiculata tropical managed mangrove forests (Southern Viet Nam)
AB  - Mangrove forests can fix and store high quantities of carbon both in their soil and in their biomass, the latter peaking in the equatorial regions and decreasing with latitude. In Vietnam, more than 80% of the mangroves develop either in the Mekong Delta or in the Can Gio Estuary, which are characterized by tropical monsoon climates. Most of these mangroves were planted and are dominated by Rhizophora apiculata Blume. The main objectives of this study were to determine forest structure, above-ground biomass and carbon conversion factors for each tree component in order to obtain allometric equations and to derive carbon stocks for managed Rhizophora stands of different ages developing within this context. Thirty-six trees, having a diameter at breast height (DBH) ranging from 7.0 to 36.2 cm, from a planted mangrove forest were harvested in Ca Mau (Mekong Delta) to determine allometric equations. In addition, thirteen plots were established in both Ca Mau and Can Gio mangrove forests, to determine above-ground carbon densities. We proposed the following specific allometric equation to estimate total above-ground biomass (kg) for managed R. apiculata mangrove stands in Southern Vietnam: WTotal = 0.38363 * DBH2.2348 (R2 = 0.976, SE = 1.17, F = 1401, P &lt; 0.001). The total above-ground biomass ranged from 135.4 to 523.6 Mg haâˆ’1 depending on forest age and tree density. Consequently, and taking into account a carbon conversion factor of 44.09%, carbon stocks in the above-ground biomass of R. apiculata mangrove forests in Southern Vietnam ranged from 59.7 to 230.9 Mg C haâˆ’1. The mean carbon partitioning in the tree biomass was: 77.11% for trunks, 11.87% for branches, 8.66% for prop roots, and 2.36% for leaves. However, this distribution, as well as annual height increments and biomass increase rates, also varied with forest age and tree densities. We suggested that tree density reduction through thinning activities allowed easier tree development, resulting in an increased biomass with enhanced allocation to branches and above-ground prop roots for the stability of the trees. Using the specific allometric equation and specific carbon conversion factor reduced the uncertainty in the estimation of above-ground biomass and carbon stocks. Â© 2018

TI  - STUDY ON ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION TECHNOLOGY OF MACROALGAE BASED ON SPORE ADHESION FUNCTION
AB  - To find an effective, economical and sustainable way of macroalgae artificial transplantation, a study based on the adhesive properties of spore tested several food additives in April, 2020. These adhesive mixtures were mixed with S. horneri spore and applied on the reef both inside and outside the laboratory. After observing the attachment, germination and growth situation of spore, the optimal adhesive was picked out. Meanwhile, the study of low temperature preservation of macroalgae spore extended the cycle of macroalgae artificial transplantation. Our results showed that: (1) algin[(C6H7O6Na)n] was a better adhesive. Higher viscosity and higher volume guaranteed better protection against current and dilution, which helps to better attachment of spore. Adhesive mixture of S. horneri spore applied on the reef survived well in subtidal zone, with a survival density of 278 ind./m2. However, only those sites with less exposure to wave and current had a good effect of transplantation in the intertidal zone. (2) Low temperature preservation of macroalgae spore prolonged the cycle of macroalgae artificial transplantation. Zygote of S. horneri preserved at (7Â±3)â„ƒ still have adhesive ability after 23 days. This adhesion had a better result against current scour. (3) The spore mucus technology can be widely used in macroalgae spore artificial breeding and transplantation. This technology covered lab spore mucus uniform spray skill, water surface spore mucus spray transplantation skill, tidal zone spore mucus uniform spray skill, subtidal zone spore mucus daub skill, and artificial reefs or algal reefs spore mucus uniform spray transplantation skill. The research provided a new way to transplant macroalgae, and will contribute to the development of adhesive exploit, spray method and facilities.

TI  - Estimation of Seagrass Biomass by In Situ Measurement and Remote Sensing Technology on Small Islands, Indonesia
AB  - As one of the major blue carbon ecosystems, studying, conserving, and monitoring seagrass meadows, especially on small populated islands, has become very important due to their vulnerability to anthropogenic and global environmental factors. In this study, we used satellite image analysis and biological data to map seagrass percent cover (SPC), above-ground biomass (AGB), and below-ground biomass (BGB) on the three most populated islands of the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia, i.e., Kodingareng Lompo, Barrang Lompo, and Barrang Caddi. Reflectance and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values of Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery were used to classify and calculate SPC and AGB. In situ biological data measurements were carried out from 3 to 14 of June, 2020, on the three islands to measure AGB and BGB. The result from image classification shows a total area of 126.37 Ha of seagrass, which was divided into three SPC categories: medium (30-59.9\%) with a total area of 78.38 Ha; low (0-29.9\%) with a total area of 13.1 Ha; and high (60-100\%) with a total area of 34.89 Ha. The highest SPC area was observed on Kodingareng Lompo Island with 61.07Ha, followed by Barrang Lompo Island with 53.18Ha, and Barrangcaddi Island with 12.12Ha. The total AGB on Barrang Lompo, Kodingareng Lompo, and Barrangcaddi in tons of dry weight/ha were 1.83, 1.05, and 2.38, respectively. The highest BGB was reported on Barrangcaddi Island with 8.61 tons of dry weight/ha, followed by Barrang Lompo Island with 6.78 tons of dry weight/ha, and Kodingareng Lompo Island with 2.78 tons of dry weight/ha. Regression analysis showed a linear correlation between NDVI value and in situ SPC with R-2 = 0.8255. The framework of this study can be applied to monitor temporal changes of seagrass meadows distribution on small islands to promote a more sustainable ecosystem.

TI  - Maximizing more barrels in brownfield rejuvenation through integrated collaboration
AB  - In today's business paradigm, early monetization of resources is a key competitive edge. This requires an effective development plan fostered via sound cost-benefit analysis followed by the systematic and timely implementation of said plan. The drive to obtain faster oil has led to a comprehensive collaboration between PETRONAS and PSC Contractors in one of its biggest oil fields. Daisy Field is situated 170km off the coast of Terengganu, Malaysia and the first oil was discovered in 1991. The field reached its peak production in 1999 (90,000 bopd) and has undergone steep decline since then, with current average production of âˆ¼25,000 bopd. Using extensive historical surveillance and production data, an initiative was taken to identify and unlock remaining reserves. A new approach to an existing engineering technique called Locating the Remaining Oil (LTRO) has been applied in Daisy Field as an alternative to time consuming static-dynamic modelling. This new approach integrates cased hole log information, production data and decline curve analysis in order to identify bypassed or undrained oil that can be monetized through behind casing or infill drilling. This paper is a case study on the utilisation of LTRO for brownfield rejuvenation. LTRO is a low-cost but effective solution for idle well reactivation; it may accelerate identification of opportunities, which could be exploitable even during low oil prices, as prevailing currently. Following its deployment within the collaboration, reserves addition has been realized, value created and the cycle time for brown field development plan approval was reduced significantly. This paper will also demonstrate how integrated collaboration between host government, operator and service provider can be a good synergy for effective brownfield rejuvenation.

TI  - A comparative CO2 emissions analysis and mitigation strategies of short-sea shipping and road transport in the Marmara Region
AB  - The Marmara is the most highly trafficked region in Turkey in terms of seaway and highway transport congestion. The transport mode-based CO2 emissions budget for the region needs to take more environmentally friendly measures. In this study, 13 ro-ro and ferry lines (RFLs) are evaluated in the Sea of Marmara to compare ship-generated CO2 emissions with road transport as if the carried vehicles had used the highway instead of transport by RFL. Additionally, this study revealed the management strategies for CO2 emissions reduction for both transport modes under current conditions. The total CO2 emissions budget of 13 RFLs in the Sea of Marmara is higher than the potential CO2 emissions of their carried vehicles. Using the methods of Entec UK Ltd and Trozzi and Vaccaro, the amount of CO2 emissions generated by the RFLs is 204,470.99 and 170,459.85 t/year, respectively. The potential CO2 emissions of road vehicles carried in 2017, 2018 and 2019 are computed by applying Tier 1 methods as 121,690.54, 106,844.89, and 100,921.95 t/year, respectively. It is observed that shifting trucks from the highway to the seaway contributes to a reduction of the yearly CO2 emissions budget generated from the transport sector to provide sustainable transportation management in the region.

TI  - Electron shuttling mediated by humic substances fuels anaerobic methane oxidation and carbon burial in wetland sediments
AB  - Key pathways for the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) have remained elusive, particularly in organic rich ecosystems. In this work, the occurrence of AOM driven by humus-catalyzed dissimilatory iron reduction was investigated in sediments from a coastal mangrove swamp. Anoxic sediment incubations supplied with both goethite (Î±-FeOOH) and leonardite (humic substances (HS)) displayed an average AOM rate of 10.7 Â± 0.8 Î¼mol CH4 cmâˆ’3 dayâˆ’1, which was 7 and 3 times faster than that measured in incubations containing only goethite or HS, respectively. Additional incubations performed with 13C-methane displayed Pahokee Peat HS-mediated carbonate precipitation linked to 13CH4 oxidation and ferrihydrite reduction (~1.3 Î¼mol carbonate cmâˆ’3 dayâˆ’1). These results highlight the role of HS on mitigating greenhouse gases released from wetlands, not only by mediating the AOM process, but also by enhancing carbon sequestration as inert minerals (calcite, aragonite and siderite).

TI  - Nearshore sediment transport as influenced by changing sea ice, north shore of Prince Edward Island, Canada
AB  - This study considers the influence of changing sea ice on nearshore sediment transport in the central north shore of Prince Edward Island, Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. It is widely accepted that changing climate is causing sea ice to decrease in the region. Sea ice attenuates wave energy thereby reducing sediment transport. The Delft3D hydrodynamic model is used to simulate waves, currents, and sediment transport in seven sea ice concentration scenarios that can be dif-ferentiated into four classes: open water (<10%), low ice (10% to 35%), moderate ice (36% to 60%), and high ice (>60%). If ice concentration decreases from high to moderate, sediment transport is expected to increase 23%. Similarly, if ice concentration decreases from moderate to low, sediment transport is expected to increase a further 24%. If ice concentration decreases from low to open water conditions, sediment transport is expected to abruptly increase a further 85%. The increase in sediment transport as sea ice decreases from high concentration to open water conditions is 180%. Linear and power-law fits of sediment transport and sea ice concentration intersect at an ice concentration of 30%, indicating this value may be a useful threshold in planning for increased coastal erosion and developing appropriate adaptation strategies, in particular, adapting to increased sediment transport near tidal inlets and navigation channels.

TI  - Understanding the full extent of the R&D capability within Brazilian Universities
AB  - E&P companies in Brazil are required to invest in R&D projects with Brazilian universities as part of the special participation fee. Industry wide, this levy is expected to be cumulatively worth USD 10 Billion by the year 2022 and therefore the need exists for E&P companies to maximise value obtained through these R&D investments by understanding the full extent of the R&D capability within Brazil. A comprehensive and independent analysis of the E&P research capabilities of leading Brazilian R&D institutions has been carried out. The resulting R&D Landscape Map can now help the decision making process by identifying and selecting R&D institutions with the capability and resource capacity to deliver world-class results. Three E&P companies have recently collaborated with a firm of consultants to develop this R&D Landscape Map, a unique undertaking which has never been completed to this level of detail. This paper highlights some of the key results and conclusions from this multi-operator project, which comprised three phases of work. These phases included the development of an international university benchmarking diagnostic, primary research amongst Brazilian universities, and subsequent analysis and benchmarking. In the first phase, seven 'world-class' oil and gas research universities were visited in the USA and Europe. The objective of these visits was to create a calibrated diagnostic for assessing world-class excellence for conducting research across three dimensions - quality of working together, quality of resources, and track record. In the second phase, detailed visits were made to 48 shortlisted E&P research departments in Brazil, in order to carry out an independent and comprehensive assessment of their R&D resources, including staff and facilities. Finally, an assessment was made of how well the Brazilian research groups compare to their US/ European counterparts using key performance indicators. Recommendations were made as to how value may be maximised from this huge investment in R&D, for the benefit of all stakeholders including the government, E&P companies, universities and research organisations, and the Brazilian people.

TI  - Decommissioning of Offshore Platforms in Adriatic Sea: The Total Removal Option from a Life Cycle Assessment Perspective
AB  - The international energy scenario to date is heavily based on fossil energy sources such as coal, oil or natural gas. According to the international ecological goals of the UNFCCC formalized in the legally binding treaty called the Paris Agreement, the next global challenges will be the decommissioning, dismantling or reconversion of the current fossil energy system into a new, more sustainable system that makes more efficient use of renewable energy technologies. Worldwide, there are about 6500 offshore oil and gas facilities and about 130 of them are located in the Mediterranean basin, mainly in the Adriatic and Ionian Seas: more than 110 offshore gas platforms have been installed in these areas since 1960. In this paper, using Life Cycle Assessment, the environmental and economic impacts of the total removal operations of an existing offshore platform in the context of the Adriatic Sea are assessed based on existing and registered decommissioning projects. In addition, the avoided impacts of primary steel production due to its recovery and recycling from the removed platform are assessed using the system boundary expansion method.

TI  - A futuristic least-cost optimisation model of CO2 transportation and storage in the UK/UK Continental Shelf
AB  - The owners of 8 power plants in the UK have announced interest in capturing and sequestering CO2. Using various criteria from the literature twenty fields in the UK Continental Shelf were selected as possible sinks for the captured CO2. Using a linear programming model, the study determined the least-cost transportation network under various constraints on the volumes of CO2 captured from the sources and the injection rates at the sinks. Four scenarios were developed to gauge the sensitivity of the results to these and to the availability of fields for EOR and Permanent Storage. Depending on the scenario, the optimal transportation CAPEX was found to range between Â£3.5 and Â£5.2 billion in real terms. With higher minimum injection rates at the fields, accelerating CO2-EOR investments was found to reduce unit transportation CAPEX compared to waiting for their cessation of production dates. On the other hand a combination of the later availability of the CO2-EOR fields plus a lower minimum injection rate yielded the minimum transportation network CAPEX. The modelling also unveiled the problem of CO2 supply overflows in the longer term. The modelling approach has wide applicability beyond the UK. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - High-Frequency Variability of Small-Particle Carbon Export Flux in the Northeast Atlantic
AB  - The biological carbon pump exports carbon fixed by photosynthesis out of the surface ocean and transfers it to the deep, mostly in the form of sinking particles. Despite the importance of the pump in regulating the air-sea CO2 balance, the magnitude of global carbon export remains unclear, as do its controlling mechanisms. A possible sinking flux of carbon to the mesopelagic zone may be via the mixed-layer pump: a seasonal net detrainment of particulate organic carbon (POC)-rich surface waters, caused by sequential deepening and shoaling of the mixed layer. In this study, we present a full year of daily small-particle POC concentrations derived from glider optical backscatter data, to study export variability at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP) sustained observatory in the Northeast Atlantic. We observe a strong seasonality in small-particle transfer efficiency, with a maximum in winter and early spring. By calculating daily POC export driven by mixed-layer variations, we find that the mixed-layer pump supplies an annual flux of at least 3.0 +/- 0.9 g POC.m(-2).year(-1) to the mesopelagic zone, contributing between 5\% and 25\% of the total annual export flux and likely contributing to closing a gap in the mesopelagic carbon budget found by other studies. These are, to our best knowledge, the first high-frequency observations of export variability over the course of a full year. Our results support the deployment of bio-optical sensors on gliders to improve our understanding of the ocean carbon cycle on temporal scales from daily to annual.

TI  - Long-term nitrogen enrichment accelerates soil respiration by boosting microbial biomass in coastal wetlands
AB  - Coastal wetlands are essential in terrestrial carbon balance because they act as natural ``blue carbon{''} sinks, influenced by anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment. N enrichment alters soil environment and plant growth, impacting carbon loss through soil respiration (Rsoil). However, the responses of Rsoil to N enrichment remain elusive in coastal wetlands, hindering the estimation of carbon fluxes. To bridge this knowledge gap, we used an 8-year field N fertilization platform in the coastal wetlands of the Yellow River Delta, China, to measure Rsoil composed of heterotrophic respiration and autotrophic respiration, and multiple indicators of soil properties, microbial activities, and plant growth. We found long-term N enrichment increased Rsoil by 26.6 +/- 1.2\% (mean +/- standard deviation) and quadrupled microbial biomass carbon, accounting for 26.9 +/- 1.2\% of the increase in heterotrophic respiration. In addition, N enrichment boosted plant growth, increasing the above-ground biomass by 28.7 +/- 6.9\% while inducing a cooling effect that partly offsets the increase in autotrophic respiration. In particular, N enrichment elevated soil temperature sensitivity of Rsoil with the increase of N levels, suggesting that the nutrient-related control of Rsoil responds to warming. The study indicates that N enrichment stimulates Rsoil in coastal wetlands by boosting microbial biomass carbon through interactions between soil environmental conditions and plant growth. These results have implications for predicting the carbon cycle with anthropogenic N enrichment.

TI  - Multicriteria Analysis of Alternative Marine Fuels in Sustainable Coastal Marine Traffic
AB  - Marine transportation is considered to be one of the most important aspects of global transportation services. Due to the increase in marine transportation, there are significant impacts on the marine environment. One of the possible measures for mitigation of the environmental impact could be switching to environmentally friendly fuel. However, the alternative fuel selection process is considered to be a problem due to various criteria to be considered and stakeholders that should be involved in the selection process. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the application of multicriteria analysis as a decision-support tool for the alternative marine fuel selection problem in coastal marine traffic. The suggested methodology takes into account environmental, technological, and economic aspects, and ensures the participation of different stakeholders in the selection process. The priority ranking of the alternatives is based on a combination of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW). The implementation of this method considers the involvement of relevant stakeholders through evaluation of the criteria weights and performance of each alternative with respect to each criterion. The method is applied for the case study of Croatia, where the results demonstrated that the best alternative for all stakeholders is electric propulsion, even though there are differences in opinions and perceptions with respect to the objectives and criteria. The findings of this analysis, likely the first of this type in this area, can serve as a solid basis for strategic planning.

TI  - Powering new frontier ultradeepwater: R & D, innovation or evolution?
AB  - The subsea portion of the oil industry began as small power consumers connected to a bulk power system provider (a topsides host). The growing demand for oil and gas worldwide coupled with the depletion of existing fields is driving production towards deepwater assets further away from the shore or a host facility. Such fields require ultra-reliable bulk long-distance power that will push AC power transmission/distribution (T&D) to its technical limit. The technology challenges that the oil industry will face in realizing economic power supplies for ultra-deepwater require focus in a number of strategic areas. Reconciling these challenges with the continued growth in energy demand (the advent of the Subsea Processing era) highlights the need for a diverse, industry-wide approach. For example, some estimates put the power need for subsea -pumping, -compression, - separation and -processing systems to as much as +30 MW (full field development). The aim of this paper is to review systems that can supply power to the New Frontier Ultra-Deepwater. The focus will be on the identification and evaluation of optimal system(s) for the generation and delivery of electrical power. In tandem with this is a comparison of the three (3) competing power system architectures: local micro-grid power; long-distance AC T&D; long-distance DC T&D (emergent solution). In making this comparison, we considered the key performance indicators (KPIs): cost, efficiency, reliability, potential for ancillary services, and technology readiness level (TRL). The paper concludes with recommendations for future investigations. Copyright 2010, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - An experimental study for flow assurance of the methane hydrate production test system
AB  - The world's first offshore methane hydrate production test was carried out in March 2013 in the Eastern Nankai Trough. The dissociation of methane hydrates in sediments was produced by depressurization. In this situation, flow assurance (FA) and prevention of hydrate re-formation in the wellbore is an important issue because water mixed with methane is transported through the well and seabed facilities, and subject to the well bore flowing pressure while being cooled-down by the surrounding seawater (around 4 C near the seabed). A particular concern results from incomplete downhole gas separation of methane and water: this leads to the methane production line containing a small amount of water, and the water production line containing a small amount of free methane gas. In this water dominant flow line there is then the possibility of flow blockage due to gas hydrate re-formation and accumulation, but knowledge about behavior of hydrates under such water dominant conditions was not well known. To investigate the potential for hydrate re-formation downstream of the downhole separator (including subsea pipes and equipment), Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) and Oilfield Production Technologies (OPT) developed a unique flow loop maintained at low temperature and high pressure. The flow loop was some 20 m in length. Notably, 6 m of the flow loop was constructed in optically clear cast acrylic, which allowed image capture in horizontal and vertical flow lines, and at flow stagnation points, of 1. methane/water flows outside the hydrate region 2. the formation, development and flow characteristics of hydrate slurries In this paper we describe the flow loop design, show images of flow taken by a high speed camera, and our measurements of temperature and pressure in this water dominant system, and the potential of FA problems caused by hydrate re-association. The results and observations were used in the design of the test plan and test procedures implemented in the East Nankai production testing. Copyright 2014, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - API Bulletin 2HINS - Guidance for post-hurricane structural inspection of offshore structures
AB  - Timely and cost effective inspection of offshore structures following a hurricane is critical in order to safely re-man the facilities and bring production back on-line. Recent hurricanes Ivan, Rita, Katrina and Ike in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) resulted in thousands of above and below water structural inspections of offshore structures to determine if they sustained damage. Severa of the API Recommended Practices (RPs) for offshore structures provide guidance for such "special" inspections, but the guidance is limited and general in nature. API Bulletin 2HINS (2HINS, short for Hurricane [NSpection) complements those publications and provides additional guidance specific to structural inspection following hurricanes The document is applicable to permanent fixed and floating structures in the Gulf of Mexico.

TI  - High quality water supply for the production of algae
AB  - Microalgae are unique photosynthetic organisms given that they accumulate storage lipids in substantial quantities and thrive in high salinity water. Algae cultivation is flexible on water quality. Many species of algae thrive in seawater, water from saline aquifers, or even wastewater from treatment plants. Photosynthesis, algae use solar energy to fix carbon dioxide (CO 2) into algal biomass, so the water used to cultivate algae must be enriched with CO 2. Microalgae can potentially be employed for the production of biofuels in an economically effective and environmentally sustainable manner. Microalgae have been investigated for the production of a number of different biofuels including biodiesel, bio-oil, bio-syngas, and bio-hydrogen. The production of these biofuels can be coupled with flue gas CO 2 mitigation, wastewater treatment, and the production of high-value chemicals. Â© Sila Science.

TI  - Post-Combustion Carbon Capture and Storage in Industry
AB  - Post-combustion CO2 capture as a form of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is currently the most promising technology to reduce CO2 emissions from the conversion of fossil fuels. Currently, in the form of amine scrubbing, it exists at the commercial scale; a number of other CCS technologies also exist at the commercial or near-commercial scale, in the form of pre-combustion capture from gasification processes, oxy-fuel combustion for CO2 separation, and chemical and calcium looping. While the utility market is an evident focus of CCS technology, there are some doubts about whether or not this market will be largely dominated, in the next several decades, by renewable generation and the mass enrolment of energy storage devices, or if CCS technologies will be utilized to balance the supply-demand gap. However, there remain numerous opportunities in the industrial sector for CCS technology to contribute to reducing CO2 emissions. These opportunities include well-known industries such as cement and steel as well as sectors like marine transport. This chapter will evaluate the available technologies and focus on the many opportunities that now exist in the industrial sector for CCS.

TI  - Optimization of CO2 bio-mitigation by Chlorella vulgaris
AB  - Biofixation of CO2 by microalgae has been recognized as an attractive approach to CO2 mitigation. The main objective of this work was to maximize the rate of CO2 fixation (RCO2) by the green microalga Chlorella vulgaris P12 cultivated photoautotrophically in bubble column photobioreactors under different CO2 concentrations (ranging from 2% to 10%) and aeration rates (ranging from 0.1 to 0.7vvm). Results showed that the maximum RCO2 (2.22gL-1d-1) was obtained by using 6.5% CO2 and 0.5vvm after 7days of cultivation at 30Â°C. Although final biomass concentration and maximum biomass productivity of microalgae were affected by the different cultivation conditions, no significant differences were obtained in the biochemical composition of microalgal cells for the evaluated levels of aeration and CO2. The present study demonstrated that optimization of microalgal cultivation conditions can be considered a useful strategy for maximizing CO2 bio-mitigation by C. vulgaris. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Methodology for impact assessment of ocean CO2 sequestration on deep-sea organisms
AB  - In order to assess the biological impact of ocean CO2 sequestration, we present a methodology to quantify impacts of elevated CO2 concentration on marine organisms using existing biological data and discuss required research work for the future. For a quantitative assessment of deep-sea CO2 injection (mid-depth type) impacts on marine organisms, we estimated No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC) of CO2 for copepods. Our preliminary analysis indicated that the NOECco(2) for copepods including deep-sea species is approximate to Delta 3,000 ppm. However, further data are needed on acute, chronic and ecosystem impacts for applying reduced Assessment Factor (AF) which is essential for reliable estimation of Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNECco(2)). For an acute impact assessment, careful consideration on differences in Sensitivities to CO2 between shallow and deep-sea species is required. For the purpose of accurate chronic impact assessment, long-term experiments on sub-lethal impacts are required. However, ecosystem impacts would be difficult to predict based only on laboratory experiments and field experiments are necessary for confirming expected consequences from laboratory experiments and for lessening the uncertainties of extrapolation.

TI  - Novel low-temperature stable paraffin inhibitors for subsea application
AB  - One of the most serious flow assurance challenges encountered during oil and gas production is the deposition of paraffins on formation surfaces, flowlines, as well as on other processing equipment. Paraffin deposition can cause problems in the production system that includes blocked pipelines, lower production rates, solids-accumulation, and increased remediation time and costs. Several thermal, mechanical, and chemical methods are used to mitigate these challenges, and, of the chemical techniques available, paraffin inhibitors are deployed to mitigate the deposition problem. Several classes of polymers have been developed into paraffin inhibitors to delay the onset of paraffin precipitation and alter the crystal morphology of the precipitated paraffin particles - these combined phenomena reduce the extent of deposition. While these polymers control wax deposition, several challenges remain for their use in both cold and deep-water environments. Many of these polymers exhibit reduced solubility in common solvents used to formulate treatment products, and, as a consequence can only be blended at low concentrations for use in harsh environments. A real demand exists for new paraffin inhibitors that have enhanced formulation-stability at much higher concentrations suitable for use under low-temperature and high pressure environmental conditions. This paper describes the developmental work and performance evaluation of a novel series of polymers specifically developed for use in low-temperature environments.

TI  - Numerical Analysis of Soil Deformation and Collapse Due to Hydrate Decomposition
AB  - Natural gas hydrates are an ideal alternative clean energy source. Many countries are currently attempting the trial production of gas hydrates. Japan became the first country to achieve offshore hydrate trial production in 2013, and China conducted 60 days of continuous trial exploitation in 2017. This study analyzes the changes in the internal stress of the hydrate zone and hydrate saturation of the soil throughout the monitoring period and calculates the failure stress of the hydrate deposit layer. The Mohr-Coulomb model is used to simulate Japan's test exploitation conditions to verify the feasibility of the method. Finally, the hydrate decomposition range, the difference in the soil dip angle in the test exploitation area, and the bearing capacity of the hydrate reservoir are numerically simulated to evaluate the stability of the soil. Through the sensitivity analysis of the hydrate decomposition range and the inclination angle of the hydrate sediment layer, it can be found that the hydrate decomposition range has the greatest impact on the deformation, and the soil around the decomposition area may be sheared and collapsed. Within 1 week of decompression and exploitation, the hydrate decomposition radius is approximately 3 m. When the inclination angle increases from 3 degrees to 9 degrees, the sediment deformation increases by 12 times. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the critical value of the decomposition range during the exploitation process.

TI  - Compliance and port air quality features with respect to ship fuel switching regulation: a field observation campaign, SEISO-Bohai
AB  - Since 1 January 2017, ships berthed at the core ports of three designated ``domestic emission control areas{''} (DECAs) in China should be using fuel with a sulfur content less than or equal to 0.5 \%. In order to evaluate the impacts of fuel switching, a measurement campaign (SEISO-Bohai) was conducted from 28 December 2016 to 15 January 2017 at Jingtang Harbor, an area within the seventh busiest port in the world. This campaign included meteorological monitoring, pollutant monitoring, aerosol sampling and fuel sampling. During the campaign, 16 ship plumes were captured by the on-shore measurement site, and 4 plumes indicated the usage of high-SF (SF refers to the sulfur content of marine fuels). The average reduction of the mean Delta NOx/Delta SO2 ratio from high-sulfur plumes (3.26) before 1 January to lowsulfur plumes (12.97) after 1 January shows a direct SO2 emission reduction of 75 \%, consistent with the sulfur content reduction (79 \%). The average concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 mu m), NOx, SO2, O-3 and CO during campaign were 147.85 mu g m(-3), 146.93, 21.91, 29.68 ppb and 2.21 ppm, respectively, among which NOx reached a maximum hourly concentration of 692.6 ppb, and SO2 reached a maximum hourly concentration of 165.5 ppb. The mean concentrations of carbonaceous and dominant ionic species in particles were 6.52 (EC-elemental carbon), 23.10 (OC-organic carbon), 22.04 (SO24-), 25.95 (NO3-) and 13.55 (NH4+) mu gm(-3). Although the carbonaceous species in particles were not significantly affected by fuel switching, the gas and particle pollutants in the ambient air exhibited clear and effective improvements due to the implementation of low-sulfur fuel. Comparison with the prevailing atmospheric conditions and a wind map of SO2 variation concluded a prompt SO2 reduction of 70\% in ambient air after fuel switching. Given the high humidity at the study site, this SO2 reduction will abate the concentration of secondary aerosols and improve the acidity of particulate matter. Based on the enrichment factors of elements in PM2.5, vanadium was identified as a marker of residual fuel ship emissions, decreasing significantly by 97.1\% from 309.9 ng m(-3) before fuel switching to 9.1 ng m(-3) after regulation, which indicated a crucial improvement due to the implementation of low-sulfur fuels. Ship emissions were proven to be significantly influential both directly and indirectly on the port environment and the coastal areas around Bohai Bay, where the population density reaches over 650 people per square kilometer. The results from this study report the positive impact of fuel switching on the air quality in the study region and indicate a new method for identifying the ship fuel type used by vessels in the area.

TI  - Negative emissions technologies and carbon capture and storage to achieve the Paris Agreement commitments
AB  - How will the global atmosphere and climate be protected? Achieving net-zero CO2 emissions will require carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce current GHG emission rates, and negative emissions technology (NET) to recapture previously emitted greenhouse gases. Delivering NET requires radical cost and regulatory innovation to impact on climate mitigation. Present NET exemplars are few, are at small-scale and not deployable within a decade, with the exception of rock weathering, or direct injection of CO2 into selected ocean water masses. To keep warming less than 2 degrees C, bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) has been modelled but does not yet exist at industrial scale. CCS already exists in many forms and at low cost. However, CCS has no political drivers to enforce its deployment. We make a new analysis of all global CCS projects and model the build rate out to 2050, deducing this is 100 times too slow. Our projection to 2050 captures just 700 Mt CO2 yr(-1), not the minimum 6000 Mt CO2 yr(-1) required to meet the 2 degrees C target. Hence new policies are needed to incentivize commercial CCS. A first urgent action for all countries is to commercially assess their CO2 storage. A second simple action is to assign a Certificate of CO2 Storage onto producers of fossil carbon, mandating a progressively increasing proportion of CO2 to be stored. No CCS means no 2 degrees C. This article is part of the theme issue `The Paris Agreement: understanding the physical and social challenges for a warming world of 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels'.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration at a Forested Wetland Receiving Treated Municipal Effluent
AB  - Secondarily treated municipal effluent has been discharged since 2006 into a 1439Â ha cypress-tupelo forested wetland in coastal Louisiana. Changes in carbon stocks of trees and soils as well as emissions of methane and nitrous oxide were measured over a one-year period and compared to baseline conditions derived from the scientific literature. Methods and equations were applied from the American Carbon Registry (ACR) wetland carbon offset methodology â€˜Restoration of Degraded Deltaic Wetlands of the Mississippi Deltaâ€™. The cumulative carbon sequestered in the Project scenario was 4090 mt CO2e/y by trees and 13,752 mt CO2e/y by soils, while 32,982 mt CO2e/y of greenhouse gasses were emitted. The Baseline scenario sequestered 3790 mt CO2e/y by trees and 2435 mt CO2e/y by soils while emitting 70,870 mt CO2e/y in greenhouse gasses. The net difference between the Project and Baseline emissions was 11,617 mt CO2e/y if greenhouse gasses were omitted and 49,505 mt CO2e/y if greenhouse gasses were included. This study demonstrates the potential of using forested wetlands receiving treated municipal effluent for the net sequestration of carbon. Â© 2017, Society of Wetland Scientists.

TI  - Managing fuel efficiency and emissions
AB  - Fuel prices and environmental concerns are a high priority for shipowners. The International Maritime Organization's (IMO) Maritime Environment Protection Committee adopted guidelines for the voluntary CO2 indexing of ships in July 2005. In association with Lloyd's Register (LR), studies have recently been undertaken to investigate how to reduce ships' fuel consumption and emissions while remaining cost-neutral. Adopting advanced technologies and best-practice operation management indicated significant potential for consumption reduction. For newbuilds, the proposed operating profile and tailoring the selection of the plant should be taken into account, whereas for existing ships, ship energy management should harmonize the ship's operations with the efficient use of the installed plant.

TI  - Improving service reliability for drilling and evaluation operations using an optimized RCM strategy
AB  - Drilling and evaluation services require repair and maintenance (R&M) programs to ensure that assets are returned to the fit-for-purpose state before their next application. R&M costs constitute a large percentage of the cost of service for an oil field services company. Consequently, there is a continuous "tactical" push to reduce R&M costs by increasing intervals, inspections, etc. To optimize a maintenance strategy, the cost of an on-rig failure or cost of failure (CoF) must be included. These costs include unplanned maintenance, lost asset utilization, transportation costs, variable labor costs, etc. The CoF indirectly includes the impact on the operator in terms of non-productive time (NPT) or unplanned downtime on the rig that could result in concessions or loss of contract. A reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) strategy provides a cost model that allows the service provider to consider internal cost reduction and customer impact. This paper presents the RCM-based maintenance strategy currently being developed at Baker Hughes, and reviews the model and the tradeoffs that must be made between product costs (R&M costs) and the cost of a downhole failure (cost of failure) to the operator and the service company. As the applications become more difficult (deeper, hotter, higher pressures, etc.), and the cost of operations continues to rise, there is increasing pressure on the service companies to reduce the downhole failure rates and extend the useful lives of the rental assets to keep the R&M costs at a minimum. Not only is tracking individual part conditions and history important for implementing a traditional condition-based maintenance (CBM) strategy, but also the Cost of Failure for the service provider and operator is important.

TI  - Eco-efficiency assessment of shrimp aquaculture production in Mexico
AB  - Globally, human society faces the challenge of providing food to a growing population, at the same time that the effects of climate change and resource depletion must be addressed. Aquaculture allows to ensure a safe supply of different marine species and is a major technological and biological undertaking. Taking into account that in Sonora (Mexico), there are more than 200 aquaculture plants, the analysis of this sector implies a joint and harmonized assessment, considering not only life cycle assessment (LCA), but also data envelopment analysis (DEA). This study focuses on the application of LCA + DEA methodology to assess the ecoefficiency of 38 semiintensive shrimp farms located in the state of Sonora. LCA results showed that feed management and electricity consumption are the main critical points in almost all the impact categories. Further improvement actions were evaluated, the replacement of wheat meal for Dried Distiller Grains with Solubles (DDGS) resulted in environmental impact reductions ranged from 2\% to 57\%, depending on the impact category. On the other hand, the installation of photovoltaic panels in the area was evaluated, looking for a shift towards a less carbon-intensive energy production. Overall, the implementation of these improvement measures will contribute to increased environmental protection and resource efficiency.

TI  - Mixed-layer carbon cycling at the Kuroshio Extension Observatory
AB  - Seven years of data from the NOAA Kuroshio Extension Observatory (KEO) surface mooring, located in the North Pacific Ocean carbon sink region, were used to evaluate drivers of mixed-layer carbon cycling. A time-dependent mass balance approach relying on two carbon tracers was used to diagnostically evaluate how surface ocean processes influence mixed-layer carbon concentrations over the annual cycle. Results indicate that the annual physical carbon input is predominantly balanced by biological carbon uptake during the intense spring bloom. Net annual gas exchange that adds carbon to the mixed layer and the opposing influence of net precipitation that dilutes carbon concentrations make up smaller contributions to the annual mixed-layer carbon budget. Decomposing the biological term into annual net community production (aNCP) and calcium carbonate production (aCaCO(3)) yields 7 +/- 3 mol Cm-2 yr(-1) aNCP and 0.5 +/- 0.3 mol Cm-2 yr(-1) aCaCO(3), giving an annually integrated particulate inorganic carbon to particulate organic carbon production ratio of 0.07 +/- 0.05, as a lower limit. Although we find that vertical physical processes dominate carbon input to the mixed layer at KEO, it remains unclear how horizontal features, such as eddies, influence carbon production and export by altering nutrient supply as well as the depth of winter ventilation. Further research evaluating linkages between Kuroshio Extension jet instabilities, eddy activity, and nutrient supply mechanisms is needed to adequately characterize the drivers and sensitivities of carbon cycling near KEO.

TI  - Green energy from marine algae: Biogas production and composition from the anaerobic digestion of Irish seaweed species
AB  - Marine algae have emerged as an alternative feedstock for the production of a number of renewable fuels, including biogas. In addition to energy potential, other characteristics make them attractive as an energy source, including their ability to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2), higher productivity rates than land-based crops and the lack of water use or land competition. For Ireland, biofuels from marine algae can play an important role by reducing imports of fossil fuels as well as providing the necessary energy in rural communities. In this study, five potential seaweed species common in Irish waters, Saccorhiza polyschides, Ulva sp., Laminaria digitata, Fucus serratus and Saccharina latissima, were co-digested individually with bovine slurry. Batch reactors of 120 ml and 1000 ml were set up and incubated at 35Â°C to investigate their suitability for production of biogas. Digesters fed with S. latissima produced the maximum methane yield (335 ml g volatile solids -1 (gVS-1)) followed by S. polyschides with 255 ml gVS-1. L. digitata produced 246 ml gVS -1 and the lowest yields were from the green seaweed Ulva sp. 191 ml gVS-1. The methane and CO2 percentages ranged between 50-72% and 10-45%, respectively. The results demonstrated that the seaweed species investigated are good feedstocks candidates for the production of biogas and methane as a source of energy. Their use on a large-scale process will require further investigation to increase yields and reduce production costs. Â© 2013 Taylor &amp; Francis.

TI  - Implementation of Battery Energy Storage System for an Island Microgrid with High PV Penetration
AB  - This article presents the innovative integrated control strategies of the battery energy storage system (BESS) to support the system operation of an offshore island microgrid with high penetration of renewable energy. An intelligent energy management system (iEMS) was implemented to perform the supervisory control and data acquisition of diesel generators, distribution feeders, photovoltaic (PV) systems, and the BESS. An expert system was designed and embedded in the iEMS to derive the decision making for fast power discharging of BESS to improve the system transient stability for the severe contingency of large disturbances caused by the tripping of generators and PV farm. To mitigate the impact of PV generation fluctuation and to maintain the stable operation of diesel generators, the adaptive control of power charging and discharging of the BESS is applied to reduce the ramping rate of PV generation. To achieve the economic dispatch of the microgrid, the strategy of peak shaving and valley filling of the system net load curve by the BESS was derived considering the forecasting daily profiles of system loading and PV power generation. The computer simulation of actual diesel generator tripping and the field test of intentional PV system shutdown have been executed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies of the BESS system to improve the system operation and transient stability of the study microgrid with high penetration of renewable energy.

TI  - Long-term acclimation to near-future ocean acidification has negligible effects on energetic attributes in a juvenile coral reef fish
AB  - Increased levels of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) drive ocean acidification and have been predicted to increase the energy use of marine fishes via physiological and behavioural mechanisms. This notion is based on a theoretical framework suggesting that detrimental effects on energy use are caused by plasma acid-base disruption in response to hypercapnic acidosis, potentially in combination with a malfunction of the gamma aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors in the brain. However, the existing empirical evidence testing these effects primarily stems from studies that exposed fish to elevated CO2 for a few days and measured a small number of traits. We investigated a range of energetic traits in juvenile spiny chromis damselfish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus) over 3months of acclimation to projected end-of-century CO2 levels (similar to 1000 mu atm). Somatic growth and otolith size and shape were unaffected by the CO2 treatment across 3months of development in comparison with control fish (similar to 420 mu atm). Swimming activity during behavioural assays was initially higher in the elevated CO2 group, but this effect dissipated within similar to 25min following handling. The transient higher activity of fish under elevated CO2 was not associated with a detectable difference in the rate of oxygen uptake nor was it mediated by GABA(A) neurotransmitter interference because treatment with a GABA(A) antagonist (gabazine) did not abolish the CO2 treatment effect. These findings contrast with several short-term studies by suggesting that end-of-century levels of CO2 may have negligible direct effects on the energetics of at least some species of fish.

TI  - Seagrass tolerance to herbivory under increased ocean temperatures
AB  - Climate change is acknowledged as a major threat to marine ecosystems, but the effect of temperature on species interactions remains poorly understood. We quantified the effects of long-term warming on plant-herbivore interactions of a dominant seagrass, Zostera muelleri. Growth, herbivory and tolerance to damage were compared between a meadow warmed by the thermal plume from a power station for 30. years (2-3. Â°C above background temperatures) and three control locations. Leaf growth rates and tissue loss were spatially variable but unrelated to temperature regimes. Natural herbivory was generally low. Simulated herbivory experiments showed that the tolerance of Z. muelleri to defoliation did not differ between warm and unimpacted meadows, with damaged and undamaged plants maintaining similar growth rates irrespective of temperature. These results suggest that the ability of temperate Z. muelleri to tolerate herbivory is not strongly influenced by warming, and this species may be relatively resilient to future environmental change.

TI  - Nonlinear Finite-Volume Scheme for Complex Flow Processes on Corner-Point Grids
AB  - The numerical simulation of subsurface processes requires efficient and robust methods due to the large scales and the complex geometries involved. In this article, a nonlinear finite-volume scheme is presented and applied to non-isothermal two-phase two-component flow in porous media. The idea of the scheme and the model used for the simulations are outlined and a comparison to a standard scheme used in industrial codes is made. Large-scale offshore CO2 storage in the Johansen formation serves as a benchmark problem, where it is demonstrated that the new scheme can handle highly complex corner-point grids and reproduces the physical processes with a higher accuracy than the standard discretization scheme.

TI  - Current status and trends in extraction of bioactives from brown macroalgae using supercritical CO2 and subcritical water
AB  - Bioactive compounds from brown seaweeds, such as polysaccharides, phenolics and pigments, have shown a range of health-promoting properties that can be implemented in products like functional foods, cosmetics and medicine. Extraction is therefore crucial in recovering these bioactive compounds, but conventional methods today need to be more sustainable and efficient. In this review, the extraction of brown seaweeds using supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) and subcritical water (SCW) is discussed comprehensively. Previous studies have shown that these two extraction technologies enhance the overall extraction yield of brown seaweed bioactive compounds when process parameters are optimised. These technologies have also been combined, either together or with other extraction methods, to improve overall extraction yield. Although this review shows the research progress of these technologies for brown seaweeds, scale-up operations are still challenging owing to a variety of factors. Further research should focus on optimisation such that scale-up is less difficult. With the knowledge presented in this review and with further work, these eco-friendly extraction technologies could be commercialised within the seaweed industry. Â© 2022 The Authors.

TI  - A cold repair method for FPSOs
AB  - A series of joint industry projects and field trials was carried out to develop a bonded patch repair method for metallic load bearing structures on floating production, storage, and offloading vessels. The cold repair method replaces hot-work, thus avoiding any interruptions of production. Examples of successful use of bonded patch repair are put forward. This experience and the JIP project results have been summarized in a DNV Recommended Practice (RP) on bonded patch repair. The RP provides guidance for cold repair of noncritical defects and installation of secondary structures. It covers criticality assessment of defect, design of patch, qualification of materials and patch, fabrication on location and inspection. A method to predict the capacity of bonded patches is presented. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the Offshore Technology Conference 2012 (Houston, TX 4/30/2012-5/3/2012).

TI  - Drained capacity of a suction caisson in sand under inclined loading
AB  - Suction caissons have recently been considered as potential anchoring solutions for floating renewable devices (wind turbines and wave energy converters) in shallow waters, where-unlike for floating oil and gas applications in deep water-sandy seabeds are to be expected. This paper presents a simple framework to calculate the maximum drained capacity of a caisson under inclined loading in sand and the associated position of the padeye, as a function of the load inclination. The framework assumes critical-state conditions and is based on the establishment of yield envelopes in the horizontal and vertical loading space at the location of the padeye. The yield envelopes were established through numerical modeling and validated by centrifuge tests; they are described by a closed-form solution that enables the prediction of caisson capacity.

TI  - Seasonal variations in soil physicochemical properties and microbial community structure influenced by Spartina alterniflora invasion and Kandelia obovata restoration
AB  - Spartina alterniflora invasion has initiated one of the greatest changes to occur in coastal wetlands in China, and eco-logical replacement using mangrove species such as Kandelia obovata is an effective method for controlling these in-vasions. The effects of S. alterniflora invasions and subsequent K. obovata restorations on soil microbial community structures in different seasons are still not fully understood. In this study, soil samples were collected from six veg-etation types (unvegetated mudflat, invasive S. alterniflora stands, one-/eight-/ten-year K. obovata restoration areas, and native mature K. obovata forests) in summer and winter. The variations in the soil microbial community struc-ture between the vegetation types across two seasons were then characterized based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and the physicochemical properties that shaped the microbial communities were also determined. The invasion and restoration processes significantly influenced microbial community diversity, composition, and putative functions in different seasonal patterns. Microbial communities from a ten-year restoration area and a native mature K. obovata area shared more similarities than other areas. In both seasons, the key environmental factors driving microbial community included total carbon and nitrogen content, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen, and the soil pH. In addition, total sulfur and total phosphorus contents significantly contributed to structuring microbial communities in summer and winter, respectively. This study provides insights into microbial diversity, composition, and functional profiles in association with physicochemical impacts, with the aim of understanding microbial ecological functions during the invasion and restoration processes in wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Single-trip multizone gravel-packing case history improves anticipated production from the berantai field
AB  - The Berantai Field is a marginal sand-prone formation located offshore in the Malaysian Peninsula, and its development was chosen for Malaysia's first Risk Service Contracts (RSCs). A key performance requirement was to complete and produce the gas wells, sand free at a certain target production rate. However, during development of the field, up to twenty multilayered, unconsolidated sand formations that had not been considered in the FDP were discovered, increasing the challenges for the completion strategy. The dual-string single-trip multi zone (STMZ) system was selected for the completions, as this technology had been proven to provide cost-effective, single-trip gravel-pack applications that could reduce overall cost, since the gravel packing for multiple zones could be performed in a single trip. Although completing long intervals has unique challenges for fixed-interval spacing, and the initial campaign presented other challenges, the completion plan developed by the operator and service company enabled all seven wells to be successfully delivered. A total of thirty-one zones were treated. One of the wells not only had six gravel-packed zones installed in one trip, but it also had the world's longest concentric wash pipe used to date in any dual-string STMZ completion. This paper will show how proper completion planning and dual-string STMZ technology enabled the operator to deliver the committed gas production, saved ~150K USD per gravel-packed zone, and reduced approximately 2.67 days in average rig time per well. The challenges addressed during this campaign, the methodology followed in the completion design, the detailed completion and pumping strategy success factors, and the production results obtained from this marginal field development will be presented.

TI  - Nondestructive natural gas hydrate recovery driven by air and carbon dioxide
AB  - Current technologies for production of natural gas hydrates (NGH), which include thermal stimulation, depressurization and inhibitor injection, have raised concerns over unintended consequences. The possibility of catastrophic slope failure and marine ecosystem damage remain serious challenges to safe NGH production. As a potential approach, this paper presents air-driven NGH recovery from permeable marine sediments induced by simultaneous mechanisms for methane liberation (NGH decomposition) and CH4-air or CH4-CO2/air replacement. Air is diffused into and penetrates NGH and, on its surface, forms a boundary between the gas and solid phases. Then spontaneous melting proceeds until the chemical potentials become equal in both phases as NGH depletion continues and self-regulated CH4-air replacement occurs over an arbitrary point. We observed the existence of critical methane concentration forming the boundary between decomposition and replacement mechanismsin the NGH reservoirs. Furthermore, when CO2 was added, we observed a very strong, stable, self-regulating process of exchange (CH4 replaced by CO2/air; hereafter CH4-CO2/air) occurring in the NGH. The proposed process will work well for most global gas hydrate reservoirs, regardless of the injection conditions or geothermal gradient.
