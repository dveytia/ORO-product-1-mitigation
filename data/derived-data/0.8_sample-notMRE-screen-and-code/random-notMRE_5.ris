TI  - Towards the electromechanical design of an autonomous robotic sailboat
AB  - Due to numerous influencing factors such as climate change, water quality, population growth, and geopolitical disputes over territory, among others, the world never looked so closely to our oceans. With the recent development of unmanned craft, demands such as water and marine borders monitoring can now be met with relatively low cost. A problem yet be solved in this kind of mission is the supply of power for the robotic systems given the difficulty of continuous supplying hundreds of vessels in the ocean. Therefore, this work proposes techniques and tools for the development of an automated sailboat driven primarily by wind power combined with a power system that is capable of generating electricity through photovoltaic cells located on the deck of the boat and stored in a bank of nautical batteries. Both the electronics and the electromechanical parts present in the aquatic vehicle are autonomous and therefore do not require the boat to return to land for a systematically refueling.

TI  - A novel approach to evaluate potential risk of organic enrichment in marine aquaculture farms: a case study in Sanggou Bay
AB  - A novel approach was proposed to evaluate the potential risk of organic enrichment in marine aquaculture farms without obvious environmental degradation. The approach was based on historical environmental records preserved in sediment cores, and potential risk of organic enrichment can be effectively evaluated by comparing burial fluxes of marine organic carbon (OCM) during times before and after large-scale aquaculture. A case study was conducted in Sanggou Bay. The change trends on burial fluxes of organic carbon in sediment over the past 150 years were rebuilt. OCM burial fluxes have greatly increased since the beginning of large-scale aquaculture in 1980s, reaching 16.0 similar to 16.5 times higher than that before large-scale aquaculture. The results indicate that aquaculture activities have resulted in obvious accumulation of aquacultural organic matters, although sedimental environment has not degraded seriously. Besides, if the OCM burial fluxes further increase to 3.5 similar to 7.0 times higher than that in present, sedimental environment may degrade obviously. Therefore, potential risks of organic enrichment still exist with aquaculture development in Sanggou Bay.

TI  - At what pressure shall co2 be transported by ship? An inâ€depth cost comparison of 7 and 15 barg shipping
AB  - The pipeline has historically been the preferred means to transport CO2 due to its low cost for short distances and opportunities for economies of scale. However, interest in vesselâ€based transport of CO2 is growing. While most of the literature has assumed that CO2 shipping would take place at low pressure (at 7 barg and âˆ’46 Â°C), the issue of identifying best transport conditions, in terms of pressure, temperature, and gas composition, is becoming more relevant as shipâ€based carbon capture and storage chains move towards implementation. This study focuses on an inâ€depth comparison of the two primary and relevant transport pressures, 7 and 15 barg, for annual volumes up to 20 MtCO2/year and transport distances up to 2000 km. We also address the impact of a number of key factors on optimal transport conditions, including (a) transport between harbours versus transport to an offshore site, (b) CO2 pressure prior to conditioning, (c) the presence of impurities and of purity constraints, and (d) maximum feasible ship capacities for the 7 and 15 barg options. Overall, we have found that 7 barg shipping is the most costâ€efficient option for the combinations of distance and annual volume where transport by ship is the costâ€optimal means of transport. Fur-thermore, 7 barg shipping can enable significant cost reductions (beyond 30%) compared to 15 barg shipping for a wide range of annual volume capacities. Â© 2021 by the authors.

TI  - The effectiveness of marine CO2 disposal
AB  - We consider the relative effectiveness of engineered systems for collection and marine disposal of CO2 from fossil-fuel-fired power plants using comparisons of the trend with time of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere from systems with and without marine disposal. Since the retention time for CO2 increases rapidly with depth of disposal, from a few years in the mixed layer up to several centuries as the depth increases beyond 1000 m, deep oceans have been considered as potential storage sites for CO2. However, CO2 collection and disposal consumes energy and produces extra CO2. We show that some of this extra CO2 reaches the atmosphere, so that atmospheric concentrations from systems with marine disposal ultimately exceed those from systems without controls. In some circumstances, they do so rapidly, making marine disposal less favorable than direct atmospheric release. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) can be used to compare different systems, but results for GWP highlight the difficult issue of determining what time scales are important in considering options to reduce concerns about global warming.

TI  - Analysis and optimization of the power cycle based on the cold energy of liquefied natural gas
AB  - Liquid natural gas (LNG) delivered by sea-ships contains considerable cryogenic energy which can be used for power generation before its evaporation and introduction into the system of pipe line. Electric power generation utilizing LNG cold energy is a major research direction. There are two kinds of LNG cold energy utilization in electric power generation, that is, independent thermal cycle with natural gas direct expansion and close-loop Rankin cycle. However, the efficiency of LNG cold energy utilization is low. Recently, many efforts have been dedicated to improve the efficiency of LNG cold energy utilization. Different optimizing process has been proposed to improve the utilization of LNG cold energy. However, the optimizing target and methods needed to be further decided. In this paper a new methodology combining the energy level analysis and the pinch analysis is determined. A so-called T-Î©-H diagram is introduced, where T is temperature, Î© states the energy level and H indicates the amount of energy. The proposed method can promise modifications quickly for improving a base cycle design. Utilizing this method to analysis the normal Rankin power cycle with LNG cold energy as heat sink, the results show that the thermodynamic imperfection in heat exchanger is the main position for improvement. Based on which two cascading power cycle with LNG cold energy recovery is proposed and the analytical results show that the longitudinal cascading cycle has the high performance than transverse cascading cycle. The simulating results showed that this new method is effective for improving thermodynamic cycle of power generation.

TI  - What evidence exists on the links between natural climate solutions and climate change mitigation outcomes in subtropical and tropical terrestrial regions? A systematic map protocol
AB  - Background: Natural climate solutions (NCS)-actions to conserve, restore, and modify natural and modified ecosystems to increase carbon storage or avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-are increasingly regarded as important pathways for climate change mitigation, while contributing to our global conservation efforts, overall planetary resilience, and sustainable development goals. Recently, projections posit that terrestrial-based NCS can potentially capture or avoid the emission of at least 11 Gt (gigatons) of carbon dioxide equivalent a year, or roughly encompassing one third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the Paris Climate Agreement goals by 2030. NCS interventions also purport to provide co-benefits such as improved productivity and livelihoods from sustainable natural resource management, protection of locally and culturally important natural areas, and downstream climate adaptation benefits. Attention on implementing NCS to address climate change across global and national agendas has grown-however, clear understanding of which types of NCS interventions have undergone substantial study versus those that require additional evidence is still lacking. This study aims to conduct a systematic map to collate and describe the current state, distribution, and methods used for evidence on the links between NCS interventions and climate change mitigation outcomes within tropical and sub-tropical terrestrial ecosystems. Results of this study can be used to inform program and policy design and highlight critical knowledge gaps where future evaluation, research, and syntheses are needed. Methods: To develop this systematic map, we will search two bibliographic databases (including 11 indices) and 67 organization websites, backward citation chase from 39 existing evidence syntheses, and solicit information from key informants. All searches will be conducted in English and encompass subtropical and tropical terrestrial ecosystems (forests, grasslands, mangroves, agricultural areas). Search results will be screened at title and abstract, and full text levels, recording both the number of excluded articles and reasons for exclusion. Key meta-data from included articles will be coded and reported in a narrative review that will summarize trends in the evidence base, assess gaps in knowledge, and provide insights for policy, practice, and research. The data from this systematic map will be made open access.

TI  - Simulating the Earth system response to negative emissions
AB  - Natural carbon sinks currently absorb approximately half of the anthropogenic CO2 emitted by fossil fuel burning, cement production and land-use change. However, this airborne fraction may change in the future depending on the emissions scenario. An important issue in developing carbon budgets to achieve climate stabilisation targets is the behaviour of natural carbon sinks, particularly under low emissions mitigation scenarios as required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. A key requirement for low carbon pathways is to quantify the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies which will be strongly affected by carbon cycle feedbacks. Here we find that Earth system models suggest significant weakening, even potential reversal, of the ocean and land sinks under future low emission scenarios. For the RCP2.6 concentration pathway, models project land and ocean sinks to weaken to 0.8 Â±0.9 and 1.1 Â±0.3 GtC yr-1 respectively for the second half of the 21st century and to -0.4 Â±0.4 and 0.1 Â±0.2 GtC yr-1 respectively for the second half of the 23rd century. Weakening of natural carbon sinks will hinder the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies and therefore increase their required deployment to achieve a given climate stabilisation target. We introduce a new metric, the perturbation airborne fraction, to measure and assess the effectiveness of negative emissions. Â© 2016 Crown copyright and IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Inventory Routing for Ammonia Supply in German Ports
AB  - Following the International Maritime Organization (IMO), in order to safeguard the realization of the Paris Agreement on climate protection, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have to be reduced by 50% by the year 2050. This objective shall be reached by decarbonization of maritime traffic, which is why ship operators currently increasingly search for alternative fuels. Moreover, since the start of the Ukrainian war in February 2022, this issue of alternative fuels has gained central importance in political agendas. A promising candidate for clean shipping that meets the IMO goals is ammonia since it is a carbon-free fuel. Ammonia (NH3) shows good advantages in handling and storage, and it ensures long sea voyages without any significant loss in cargo space for a reasonable price. Hence, ammonia has the potential to improve the environmental footprint of global shipping enormously. Induced by the introduction of stricter regulations in the so-called emission control areas (ECAs) in Northern Europe in 2015 as well as the renewed global sulfur cap, which entered into force in 2020, ship operators had to decide between different compliance methods, among which the most popular solutions are related to the use of expensive low-sulfur fuel oils, newbuilds and retrofits for the usage of liquefied natural gas (LNG) or the installation of scrubber technology. A change to ammonia as a marine alternative fuel represents an additional novel future option, but the successful implementation depends on the availability of NH3 in the ports, i.e., on the installation of the maritime NH3 infrastructure. Currently, the single German NH3 terminal with maritime access is located in BrunsbÃ¼ttel, the western entrance to Kiel Canal. The distribution of NH3 from the existing NH3 hub to other German ports can be analyzed by the mathematical model of an inventory routing problem (IRP) that is usually solved by combinatorial optimization methods. This paper investigates the interrelated research questions, how the distribution of marine NH3 fuel can be modeled as an IRP, which distribution mode is the most economic one for the German ports and which modal mix for the NH3 supply leads to the greenest distribution. The results of this paper are empirically validated by data that were collected in several EU projects on sustainable supply chain management and green logistics. The paper includes a special section that is dedicated to the discussion of the economic turbulences related to the Ukrainian war together with their implications on maritime shipping.

TI  - Bakken flare mitigation field trial
AB  - The recent implementation of regulations on well site flaring in North Dakota has left operators struggling to find ways to manage produced gas. The Environmentally Friendly Drilling Program (EFD) and Gulf Coast Green Energy (GCGE) teamed up early this year to field trial the Power+ Generator. This technology utilizes the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) to convert waste heat into electricity that can be purposed for onsite power needs or sold back to grid. This technology can be implemented in any situation where waste heat is generated (Produced hot water, flare gas etc.) Produced gas, that would otherwise be flared, is sent to a low NOx, hot water boiler. The gas is burned inside the hot water boiler and the generated hot water will then enter a heat exchanger that excites a working fluid in the ORC generator. This in turn drives a twin screw expander to create the electricity. The Power+ System, which consists of the ORC Generator and the Boiler, was installed at a well site in the Bakken Shale region in North Dakota and ran continuously, with minimal interruption, for 90 straight days. The EFD team monitored the technology during the field trial in order to validate its ability to produce electricity from produced gas, prove that the technology could work without interfering with well operations and to determine the environmental impacts associated with the flare gas reduction. The field trial successfully demonstrated the ability of the ORC generator to produce onsite power from wasted flare gas. The generator had a cumulative runtime of 1937 hrs, generating roughly 104,000 kWh of electricity. An emissions study conducted by The Texas A&M Institute for Renewable Natural Resources (IRNR) studied the effect on the environmental impact of the ORC system. This emissions study concluded that the Power+ System reduced CO by 89%, NOx by 48%, and VOCs by 93%. This system was able to reduce key air pollutants by factors ranging from half to less than 10%. The emissions study showed that the Power+ generator would meet the goals of the US EPA and North Dakota Department of Health- Air Quality by reducing emissions and providing useful energy through the reuse of the produced natural gas.

TI  - Temporary carbon sequestration cannot prevent climate change
AB  - Storing carbon in biosphere sinks can reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the short term. However, this lowers the concentration gradient between the atmosphere and the oceans and other potential carbon reservoirs, and consequently reduces the rate of CO2 removal from the atmosphere. If carbon is released again from that temporary storage, subsequent atmospheric CO2 concentrations will, therefore, be higher than without temporary carbon storage. It is thus important to analyse whether temporary carbon storage in biosphere sinks can mitigate climate-change impacts. To analyse that, climate-change impacts need to be quantified explicitly. Impacts can be quantified: [(1)] as the instantaneous effect of increased temperature [(2)] through the rate of temperature increase [(3)] as the cumulative effect of increased temperatures. The analysis presented here shows that temporary carbon storage only reduces climate-change impacts related to the cumulative effect of increased temperature and could even worsen impacts mediated via the instantaneous effect of temperature or the rate of temperature change. This applies under both high and low greenhouse-gas emission scenarios. Because temporary carbon storage improves some, but worsens other, climate-change impacts, it achieves very little on average. For greenhouse mitigation, it is, therefore, not warranted to provide policy incentives for temporary carbon storage. Â© 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

TI  - HEADING OFFSHORE: Introducing cold water oil
AB  - â€œHeading Offshoreâ€ situates Cold Water Oil as a timely intervention at a moment of intense uncertainty. In the wake of the social and economic upheavals prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world are making crucial choices about whether to seize opportunities to build greener economies or to maintain the fossil fuel status quo. The Introduction builds a case for paying particular attention in this contex to the past, present, and future of offshore oil and gas production in the North Atlantic and Arctic regionsâ€“regions that are expensive to develop, ecologically fragile, and already disproportionately affected by climate change. Polack and Farquharson note that scholars have made only sporadic efforts to examine socio-cultural figurations of offshore oil and gas to date and position Cold Water Oil as an attempt to redress this gap. They also outline how the volume engages with the interdisciplines of environmental humanities, energy humanities, and critical ocean studies. The Introduction concludes with brief summaries of contributions to the volume and details their respective engagements with the oceanic territories of Canada, Norway, the UK, Russia, the US, and the IÃ±upiat of Alaska.

TI  - Risk Retirement-Decreasing Uncertainty and Informing Consenting Processes for Marine Renewable Energy Development
AB  - Marine renewable energy (MRE) is under development in many coastal nations, adding to the portfolio of low carbon energy sources that power national electricity grids as well as off-grid uses in isolated areas and at sea. Progress in establishing the MRE industry, largely wave and tidal energy, has been slowed in part due to uncertainty about environmental risks of these devices, including harm to marine animals and habitats, and the associated concerns of regulators and stakeholders. A process for risk retirement was developed to organize and apply knowledge in a strategic manner that considered whether specific environmental effects are likely to cause harm. The risk retirement process was tested against two key MRE stressors: effects of underwater noise from operational MRE devices on marine animals, and effects of electromagnetic fields from MRE electrical export cables on marine animals. The effects of installation of MRE devices were not accounted for in this analysis. Applying the risk retirement process could decrease the need for costly investigations of each potential effect at every new MRE project site and help move the industry beyond current barriers.

TI  - Climate Change and Agriculture: Mitigation and Adaptation
AB  - Human activities have changed the composition of the atmosphere resulting in rising global temperatures and sea levels. Agriculture contributes significantly to climate change through the emission of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Continuation of the trends of greenhouse gas emissions will result in a further increase of global warming in the coming decades. The most recent projections indicate a global warming of 1.1-6.4 degrees C by the year 2100, but in North Western Europe warming is expected to be even higher. This will result in a sea-level rise of up to 0.8 m by the year 2100. Field vegetable production systems contribute to climate change through emission of the greenhouse gases CO2 and N2O. Since field vegetables like all other plants fix atmospheric CO2, the net emission of CO2 from vegetable production systems will be insignificant, especially when high-yielding varieties are used, crop residues are not removed from the field, inorganic fertilizers are replaced by organic manures and reduced tillage is applied. N2O emission can be reduced by increasing the efficiency of N use by the vegetables. Field vegetable production systems will have to adapt to changing weather conditions, such as dryer summers and wetter winters. This implies that crops or varieties have to be used that are more stress tolerant to drought and salinity.

TI  - Saving energy with the high efficiency super boiler
AB  - The super boiler was developed to reduce emissions and increase efficiency, thus lessening the environmental impact of steam generation. It achieves high efficiency by two approaches: a staged combustion technique which allows lower excess air in combustion, and a novel heat recovery system that recovers both sensible and latent heat from the flue gas stream as well as the water vapor itself. At the current stage of development, up to 94 percent fuel-to-steam efficiency on a higher heating value (HHV) basis can be achieved. The super boiler has the potential to save U.S. industry $4 billion annually in fuel and facility costs while preventing over 140,000 tons of NOx and 20 million tons of greenhouse gases per year. A 300-horsepower (10,000-lb/h steam) boiler is being demonstrated at a manufacturing site in Alabama, and another 300-horsepower boiler field demonstration is scheduled to begin in November, 2007, at a food processing site in California.

TI  - A Marine Oil Terminal Trestle Repair and Replacement Project
AB  - This paper discusses the repair and replacement of an existing 90-yr old timber berth and trestle to meet the operational and seismic demands mandated by the Marine Oil Terminal Engineering and Maintenance Standards (MOTEMS). Many older marine oil terminals in California have been required to meet the MOTEMS regulations. However, many operators are looking for innovative ways to achieve the regulation requirements with restricted capital budgets. This terminal meets the MOTEMS requirements and capital constraints by replacing and repairing portions of the trestle. The strengthened structures meet the present demands for operational and seismic conditions as well as climate change issues. The author and his colleagues have recently completed the design and permitting of the first timber structure in the San Francisco Bay Area that includes operational, seismic, and sea level impact design requirements. The paper discusses the geotechnical and operational constraints, design criteria, permitting coordination, climate change adaptive measures, instrumentation requirements, early construction issues, and path forward for future waterfront structures. This paper also discusses the various alternative replacement and repair designs, the selection of the most cost effective options, lessons learned and some pitfalls to avoid for future rehabilitation projects.

TI  - Acoustic Impedance Inversion for Offshore CO2 Storage: South Georgia Embayment
AB  - The Southeast Offshore Storage Resource Assessment (SOSRA) research project funded by U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is focused on assessing the Atlantic offshore resources for CO2 storage. Although the storage capacity of offshore reservoirs is expected to be substantial, and despite having a number of significant advantages over onshore sites, no comprehensive assessment of the offshore storage capacity in the southeastern U.S. has been performed, previously (Franklin, 2009). Based on a study by Smyth et al. (2008) two potential CO2 reservoirs were identified in geologic strata below the Atlantic continental shelf in Upper and Lower Cretaceous layers. This study focuses on development of offshore prospective storage resource assessment of the Upper Cretaceous section within the Southeast Georgia Embayment (SGE; Figure 1) where the storage capacity in the Upper Cretaceous strata was originally estimated at around 9 GT (Almutairi et al., 2017). Using legacy industry 2-D seismic reflection and well data, this assessment is the first application of multiple seismic inversion techniques in this area. This work provides a reliable and replicable workflow of model-based inversion which provides the tools to discriminate lithology and predict porosity. The inversion results indicate that distinct porosity and permeability regimes within the Upper Cretaceous strata of the SGE. The impedance and porosity relationships show well founded and reliable correlations. These relationships reveal low seismic impedance to coincide with high porosity intervals identified on well logs and which are proposed as potential CO2 storage reservoirs. The acoustic impedance results show that the Upper Cretaceous strata have two main potential reservoirs that are overlain by a thick impermeable interval, mostly shale which has high seismic impedance, low porosity, and low permeability. The extracted values of porosity, ranging from 15 to 36 %, and permeability, ranging from 1 to 100 mD, are close to the measured values from the well core data at the Upper Cretaceous strata interval.

TI  - Enhanced dissolved organic carbon production in aquatic ecosystems in response to elevated atmospheric CO2
AB  - Although aquatic ecosystems are a major carbon reservoir, how their carbon dynamics will respond to increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 is not well understood. The availability of essential nutrients has the potential to modify carbon fluxes under elevated CO2 by altering carbon processing and storage in the biota. Here, we describe a semi-continuous culture experiment with natural phytoplankton and bacteria assemblages designed to investigate (1) how carbon dynamics in aquatic ecosystems respond to continuously elevated atmospheric CO2, and (2) whether carbon fluxes resulting from elevated CO2 are modified by changes in inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus availability. Our results showed that elevated CO2 led to significant increases in photosynthetic carbon uptake, despite a decrease in the algal chlorophyll a concentrations and no significant change in total algal biovolume. This enhancement of inorganic carbon uptake was accompanied by a significant increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production. Concurrent increases in the C/N and C/P ratios of dissolved organic matter also suggested that DOC stability increased. Nutrient availability, especially nitrogen availability, had strong effects on inorganic carbon uptake and biomass carbon pools. In contrast, CO2-enhanced DOC production was not significantly affected by varying concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. Our study underscores the importance of DOC as a potential carbon sink in aquatic ecosystems. The observed responses to changes in CO2 and nutrient availability could have important implications for long-term carbon cycling in aquatic ecosystems, and highlight the potential buffering capacity of aquatic ecosystems to future environmental change.

TI  - Use of surfactant in cement slurry to mitigate incompatibility with synthetic-based drilling fluids
AB  - In deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the use of synthetic-based drilling fluids (SBM) is common practice in all types of wells drilled by different operators. These fluids have been under constant development in past years. However, even with the latest in SBM technology, cementing operations can be adversely affected when this type of fluid is used, which can compromise the quality of the cement jobs. One of the challenges faced is the rheological incompatibility between the cement slurry and the SBM. This may lead to issues such as induced losses during primary cementing operations, due to higher friction pressures, or stuck pipe during plug placement, among others. The higher friction pressures during cement placement in primary jobs can also lead to an inaccurate or inconclusive post-job evaluation when attempting to match software-simulated pressures with actual pressures acquired during the jobs. Despite the use of mechanical separation and spacers, the post-job analysis of several recent cement jobs suggests that contact between cement slurry and drilling fluid is often still occurring. As expccted, this contact is most frequently occurring in the annular space wherein there is typically an absence of mechanical separation. In these jobs, laboratory test results using mixtures of slurry and SBM with various ratios have shown levels of incompatibility, which have been correlated to evidence of higher-Than-expected friction pressures in the same jobs. The solution proposed for this scenario is to add surfactant or surfactant-based chemical additives at low concentrations to the cement slurry. The addition of surfactant to cement slurries has been proven to reduce rheological incompatibility between the slurry and SBM and the impact of contamination on set cement properties. This paper presents the laboratory test results, operational concerns, mitigation, and a case study showing the application and effectiveness of this technique comparing similar strings that were cemented in different wells.

TI  - Response of Photosynthesis to Ocean Acidification
AB  - All phytoplankton and higher plants perform photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide is incorporated into biomass during cell growth. Ocean acidification (OA) has the potential to affect photosynthetic kinetics due to increasing seawater pCO(2) levels and lower pH. The effects of increased CO, are difficult to predict because some species utilize carbon concentrating mechanisms that buffer their sensitivity to ambient CO, levels and require variable energy investments. Here, we discuss the current state of knowledge about the effects of increased CO2 on photosynthesis across marine photosynthetic taxa from cyanobacteria and single-celled eukaryotes to marine macrophytes. The analysis shows that photosynthetic responses to OA are relatively small for most investigated species and highly variable throughout taxa. This could suggest that the photosynthetic benefits of high CO2 are minor relative to the cell's overall energy and material balances, or that the benefit to photosynthesis is counteracted by other negative effects, such as possible respiratory costs from low pH. We conclude with recommendations for future research directions, such as probing how other physiological processes respond to OA, the effects of multiple stressors, and the potential evolutionary outcomes of longterm growth under ocean acidification.

TI  - Simulation Study of CO2 EOR and Storage Potential in a North Sea Reservoir
AB  - A simulation study has been carried out using realistic model of a North Sea oil reservoir to assess the performance of CO2 flood in oil recovery compared to the base case water injection. The development strategy for this reservoir is based on one injector and a single producer. Various CO2 injection strategies were studied to define injection schemes that would outperform water injection. Pure CO2 injection, water flooding followed by CO2 injection, CO2 Water-Alternating-Gas (CO2 WAG) injection, and CO2 Simultaneous-Water-And-Gas (CO2 SWAG) injection are strategies that were studied. The latter one was chosen to study the mitigation of gravity segregation between water and gas. Various well locations and well configurations were also evaluated to determine the optimal arrangement. Simulation results showed that the increased recovery factors by the CO2 flooding varies in the range between 3 to 8 percent and is to a considerable extent dependent on well configuration and injection scheme. The flooding with SWAG (water above gas) shows very promising results due to the increased mobility control achieved. Regarding the storage potential, the analysis indicates that this method would result in highest CO2 retention in the reservoir. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Storage Readiness Levels: communicating the maturity of site technical understanding, permitting and planning needed for storage operations using CO2
AB  - A framework of Storage Readiness Levels (SRLs) is presented to communicate the entirety of technical appraisal, permitting and planning activities achieved at a potential CO2 storage site and what remains to be completed for CO2 storage operations. The schema, based on learning gained from the experience of researchers, regulators and industry from the 1990s, is described and assessed by application to 742 saline formation and hydrocarbon field sites, offshore the UK, Norway and The Netherlands. The framework is flexible to accommodate national differences in procedures and practise and the unique character of each site. It is applicable regardless of the timescale of appraisal or scale of assessment. The framework is consistent with and extends the industry commercial project development classification to include categories for sites with a lesser level of data and evaluation. Application to the phases of appraisal of three sites illustrates that investigations may advance understanding by different pathways and rates. The standardised framework enables comparison of the experience of permitting and planning activities completed within different jurisdictions, the level of investment and the duration required to achieve permitted or permit-ready sites. It is intended that the framework of SRLs should be widely applied.

TI  - Long-Term Redistribution of Residual Gas Due to Non-convective Transport in the Aqueous Phase
AB  - Geological CO2 sequestration is an effective approach to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by permanently trapping CO2 in the subsurface. A large portion of injected CO2 is trapped by capillary forces in pores and eventually dissolves into the reservoir brine due to convective mixing to achieve permanent entrapment. In regions where convective mixing is slow, non-convective transport can play an important role in redistributing residually trapped CO2, but the mechanisms and timescales for redistribution have yet to be explored thoroughly. In previous work, we have shown that capillary pressure difference among residually trapped gas ganglia can induce Ostwald ripening, thereby redistributing the separate-phase gas through diffusion despite the gas phase remaining trapped over the entire course of equilibration. In this study, we show from a thermodynamic point of view that other natural gradients in geologic formations- hydrostatic pressure, geothermal gradients and capillary heterogeneity-can also redistribute CO2 by non-convective transport. Mechanisms for resulting non-convective transport include molecular diffusion, the sedimentation effect and potentially the Soret effect. Results show that hydrostatic pressure dominates redistribution such that the separate-phase gas is transported upward through molecular diffusion and accumulates under the seal at the steady state. A typical timescale for gas phase redistribution is 10(5) years/m; for a 100-m-thick formation, redistribution is complete after similar to 10(7) years. Although non-convective transport is an extremely slow process, it causes local accumulation of the gas phase and in some settings may remobilize the trapped gas phase.

TI  - Responsible Practices for Minimizing and Monitoring Environmental Impacts of Marine Seismic Surveys with an Emphasis on Marine Mammals
AB  - Marine seismic surveys, which use loud, primarily low-frequency sound to penetrate the sea floor, are known to disturb and could harm marine life. The use of these surveys for conventional and alternative offshore energy development as well as research is expanding. Given their proliferation and potential for negative environmental impact, there is a growing need for systematic planning and operational standards to eliminate or at least minimize impacts, especially when surveys occur in sensitive areas. Mitigating immediate impacts is obviously critical, but monitoring for short-as well as long-term effects and impacts is also needed. Regulatory requirements for both mitigation and monitoring vary widely from one country or jurisdiction to another. Historically, most have focused on acute effects but share a common objective of minimizing potential adverse impacts. Specific examples in different areas are given to illustrate general approaches for predicting, minimizing, and measuring impacts for operations in essentially any marine environment. The critical elements of a robust mitigation and monitoring plan for responsibly conducting marine seismic surveys include obtaining baseline ecological data; substantial advance planning, communication, and critical review; integrated acoustic and visual monitoring during operations; and systematic analysis of results to inform future planning and mitigation.

TI  - Carbon cycling in mangrove ecosystem of western bay of bengal (India)
AB  - Carbon cycling in the mangrove ecosystem is one of the important processes determining the potential of coastal vegetation (mangroves), sediment, and adjoining waters to carbon absorption. This paper investigates the carbon storage capacity of five dominant mangrove species (Avicenia marina, Avicenia officinalis, Excoecaria agallocha, Rhizophora mucronata, and Xylocarpous granatum) on the east coast of the Indian mangrove along with the role they play in the carbon cycling phenomenon. Soil and water parameters were analyzed simultaneously with Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and Above Ground Carbon (AGC) values for 10 selected stations along. The total carbon (TC) calculated from the study area varied from 51.35 Â± 6.77 to 322.47 Â± 110.79 tons per hectare with a mean total carbon of 117.89 Â± 28.90 and 432.64 Â± 106.05 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). The alarm of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for reducing carbon emissions has been addressed by calculating the amount of carbon stored in biotic (mangroves) and abiotic (soil and water) compartments. This paper focuses on the technical investigations on the factors that control the carbon cycling process in mangroves. This blue carbon will help policymakers to develop a sustainable relationship between marine resource management and coastal inhabitants so that carbon trading markets can be developed, and the ecosystem is balanced.

TI  - The Impacts of Carbon Quotas on Supply Chain Management
AB  - Global warming has compelled us to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. To prevent climate change, in the coming future a carbon budget will be set for each country, and in turn the country will sell carbon quotas to companies. Companies can also buy or sell their quotas with each other. In other words, companies have to pay for the carbon dioxide emissions. In effect, it will deeply influence the whole supply chain of a company including sourcing, producing and distributing processes. Nowadays, with globalization, many multi-national companies deploy their manufacturing base in Asia where the production cost is low, and then transport products to major consuming markets viz U.S. and Western Europe either by sea or by air. Therefore this mode requires global oceangoing ships or long-haul flights, which consume fuel and generate carbon dioxide emissions. However, with the carbon quota or extra cost for consuming energy that will be further reflected in the corresponding price, the current mode will be significantly changed to adapt for the new constraint. Except the delivery cost adjusted by carbon quota, carbon charge will also affect the producing and storing processes, for both of them need energy consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions. In short, the supply chain of a company is forced. to be redesigned to conform to the carbon reduction obligation. This research aims to investigate the impacts of carbon quotas on supply chain management. Analytic models will be constructed to describe the trade-offs in supply chain when carbon quota is further considered. Numerical experiments will be conducted to examine the optimal solution to minimize the expected total cost.

TI  - It starts with a conversation: Achieving conservation goals in collaboration with the offshore energy industry
AB  - In many parts of the world, extensive areas of the marine environment critical for the long-term conservation of biodiversity are already impacted negatively by existing or leased-for-future offshore oil and gas extraction and the generation of renewable energy. Many of these areas are either under the jurisdiction of countries with limited ability and/or motivation to monitor and control industrial activities sustainably, or they are within international waters. To many in the conservation community, the ubiquity and massive political power of the offshore energy industry can make the idea of working collaboratively with them to forge shared solutions seem intimidating, antithetical, and possibly futile. One thing is irrefutable though-environmental risks are â€˜common groundâ€™. Environmental risks in the eyes of conservationists are operational and financial risks to industry. As much as conservationists do not want sensitive habitats or species disrupted, industry at least fears the loss of the â€˜social license to operateâ€™, and delays or full operation stoppages due to the discovery of an unknown or unidentified environmental sensitivity. Forward-thinking industrialists recognise that money invested upfront to limit environmental damage and engage stakeholders proactively and transparently, which are often conservation goals, can translate ultimately into net financial gains. Thus, although the motivations for achieving those outcomes-conservation, in one instance, and profit, in the other-are different, there can be shared goals that result in positive outcomes for conservation and for business.

TI  - Hydrodynamic and experimental analysis on a novel hybrid offshore renewable structure
AB  - Since the Kyoto Protocol in Japan in 1997, countries have been on a drive to reduce their carbon emissions but recently this drive has been given a new thrust. Security of energy supplies is now a high priority and one of the possible methods is by harnessing offshore renewable energy. It is proposed, that the use of a hybrid or a combination of two sources of renewable energy that utilizes a single floating structure can effectively reduce the cost of delivering renewable energy. Cost reduction is of key importance, however, it will not be the focus of this paper as it is a well proven concept. However, the motion characteristics of such a novel structure as the one that is presented here has never been fully examined and the literature is very limited on the subject. A scaled model of a conceptual structure was fabricated and subjected to regular waves for a range of wave heights and periods. The effect of wave-current interaction was noted and mooring line forces were measured. Conventional hydrodynamic analysis and rules used in ship structures and semi-submersible design were merged into one cohesive analysis and a comparison was made with the experimental results. There are two operational states that are mentioned, the 'hybrid mode' i.e. acting as a barge and a semisubmersible by virtue of the volume of the structure below the Mean Water Level (MWL). The second state is the 'semisubmersible mode', which has the pontoon and 75% column of the structure only below the MWL. Copyright Â© 2009 by ASME.

TI  - C Stock of Top Soil and It Spatial Distribution in Mangrove Community of Trimulyo, Semarang City
AB  - Mangrove ecosystem plays important role as carbon sink, not only on mangrove community but also on the top soil. The purposes of this research were 1) to estimates and compare C-stocks in vegetation and non-vegetation mangrove soils (represented by aquaculture ponds and mudflats); 2) modeling the spatial distribution of soil C-stocks in the study area. The purposive sampling method was used to determine 16 sample plots representing vegetation and non-vegetation mangroves. In each plot, the soil samples were taken on top soil layer (0-10 cm). For general display of spatial distribution maps of soil C-stocks, spatial interpolation is used by the Ordinary Kriging method. The result showed that total of soil C-stocks in coastal area of Trimulyo was 148.53 MgC ha(-1), with composition of 53.59\% in mangrove vegetation, 38.82\% and 7.57\% in cultivation pond and mudflat, respectively. Statistical analysis with ANOVA test showed no significant difference (p = 0.972) between soil C stock in vegetation and non-vegetation mangrove. It shows that the water column on the coast of Trimulyo has great potential as a carbon store.

TI  - Origin of organic carbon in the topsoil of Wadden Sea salt marshes
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems, including salt marshes, play an important role in the global carbon cycle because of their high-efficiency storage of organic carbon (OC) in soils. Few studies focus on the origin of OC stored in salt-marsh soils, which is either allochthonous or autochthonous. The origin, however, has important implications for carbon crediting approaches because the alternative fate of allochthonousOC(AllOC), i.e. if it had not accumulated in the blue carbon ecosystem, is unclear. Here, we assessed the origin of OC in 2mainland salt-marsh sites of the EuropeanWadden Sea, analyzing Î´13C of topsoil (0-5 cm) samples, freshly deposited sediment (allochthonous source), and aboveground and belowground biomass of vegetation (autochthonous sources). We tested for effects of geomorphological factors, including elevation and the distance to sediment sources, and of livestock grazing, as the most important land-use form, on the relative contributions of allochthonous versus autochthonous sources to the topsoilOCstock.Anegative effect of distance to the creek on the relative contribution of AllOC was found at only 1 of the 2 saltmarshes, probably due to differences in micro-topography between the 2 salt marshes. Additionally, the relative contribution of AllOC increased with increasing distance to the marsh edge in areas without livestock grazing, while it decreased in grazed areas. Our findings demonstrate that spatial factors such as surface elevation and distance to a sediment source, which have been found to determine the spatial patterns of sediment deposition, are also important factors determining the relative contribution of AllOC to topsoil OC stocks of salt marshes. Furthermore, we provide the first evidence that livestock grazing can reduce the relative contribution of AllOC to the soil OC stock. These findings thereby yield important implications for carbon crediting and land-usemanagement. Â© Inter-Research 2019.

TI  - Screening of conventional ionic liquids for carbon dioxide capture and separation
AB  - CO2 capture and storage could efficiently mitigate CO2 emissions, wherein CO2 capture is a crucial energy-intensive process. Ionic liquids (ILs) have been proposed as potential liquid absorbents for CO2 separation. The CO2 absorption capacity and selectivity of ILs have also been investigated extensively. Although ILs have been screened for CO2 separation, only specific ILs have been examined in terms of energy consumption. In this study, 76 conventional ILs were collected and screened in terms of energy consumption to establish potential ILs for CO2 separation. Seventeen ILs were screened according to the CO2 dissolution enthalpy and CO2 working capacity criteria obtained from the Henry's law constant in the preliminary screening. Seven ILs were then screened from the 17 ILs according to the CO2 working capacity from the measured CO2 solubility in the final screening. The energy consumptions of the seven screened ILs (i.e., {[}Emim]{[}NTf2], {[}Bmim]{[}BF4], [}Bmim]{[}PF6], {[}Bmim]{[}NTf2], {[}Bmim]{[}NTf2], {[}Bmpy]{[}NTf2], and {[}Hmpy]{[}NTf2]) were calculated, and the corresponding gas solubility selectivities were discussed. The energy consumptions and properties of the seven screened ILs were compared with those of the commercial CO2 absorbents of 30 wt\% MEA, 30 wt\% MDEA, and dimethyl ethers of polyethylene glycol (Selexol (TM) or Coastal AGR (R)). The results showed that the energy consumptions of the seven screened ILs were lower than those of the commercial CO2 absorbents. {[}Hmpy]{[}NTf2] showed the lowest energy consumption among the seven screened ILs under the operating conditions set in this study.

TI  - Commercialization of stranded gas with a combined oil and GTL FPSO
AB  - As most stranded fields are located in deep water, a floating gas-to-liquids (GTL) production platform with storage capacity is required. From this specification, a concept evolved that merged GTL technology with a floating production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) capable of oil and condensate production. A feasibility study conducted by Bluewater Energy Services BV and Syntroleum, supported by Amec Oil & Gas, has determined the viability of combining these two technologies. The synergy between FPSO and GTL utilities has resulted in a steam-dominated plant with maximized heating and cooling integration. Virtually, all GTL by-products (heat, steam, low-Btu gas, and process water) are used by the FPSO systems, requiring only minor additional fuel gas consumption. For the GTL FPSO, the constant supply of natural gas to the GTL plant may be of higher priority. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the Offshore Technology Conference 2006: New Depths, New Horizons (Houston, TX 5/1-4/2006).

TI  - Petrophysical and numerical seismic modelling of CO2 geological storage in the E6 structure, Baltic Sea, offshore Latvia
AB  - Time-lapse numerical seismic modelling based on rock physics studies was for the first time applied to analyse the feasibility of CO2 storage monitoring in the largest Latvian offshore geological structure E6 in the Baltic Sea. The novelty of this approach was the coupling of the chemically induced petrophysical alteration effect of CO2-hosting rocks measured in laboratory with time-lapse numerical seismic modelling. Synthetic seismograms were computed for the E6 structure, where the sandstone reservoir of the Deimena Formation of Cambrian Series 3 (earlier Middle Cambrian) was saturated with different concentrations of CO2. The synthetic seismograms obtained after CO2 injection were compared with the baseline. The following four scenarios were considered: (1) a uniform model without the alteration effect; (2) a uniform model with the alteration effect; (3) a plume model without the alteration effect; and (4) a plume model with the alteration effect. The presence of CO2 in the reservoir layers can be detected by direct comparison and interpretation of plane-wave synthetic seismic sections, and is clearly observed when one displays the difference between the baseline and post-CO2 injection synthetics. The normalized root-mean-square imaging techniques also clearly highlight the time-lapse differences between the baseline and post-injection seismic data. The laboratory-conducted alteration of the petrophysical properties of the reservoir had a strong influence on the reflected signals in the seismic sections. The greatest difference was revealed on seismic sections with 1% CO2 saturation, increasing the detectability of the stored CO2. The difference decreased with an increase in CO2 content. The saturation of CO2 could be qualitatively estimated up to a value of 5%. Higher saturation produced a strong signal in the repeatability metrics but the seismic velocity varied so slightly with the increasing gas content that the estimation was challenging. A time shift or push-down of the reflectors below the CO2 storage area was observed for all scenarios. According to changes in the amplitude and two-way travel times in the presence of CO2, reflection seismics could detect CO2 injected into the deep aquifer formations even with low CO2 saturation values. Our data showed the effectiveness of the implemented time-lapse rock physics and seismic methods in the monitoring of the CO2 plume evolution and migration in the E6 offshore oil-bearing structure. The new results obtained could be applied to other prospective structures in the Baltic region. Â© 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Solar driven interfacial steam generation (SISG) is a desirable strategy to enhance solar to steam efficiency by transferring sunlight into heat and inspiring seawater vaporization at interface between liquid and gas. SISG has been recognized as a promising strategy to solve water shortages in an eco-friendly and low-cost way, due to the fact that it just utilizes sea water and solar energy, both of which are considered as inexhaustible resources on the earth. However, there still are many challenges, including low evaporation rate, difficulty in collecting vapor and poor antibiofouling. Recent advances in SISG and the unique advantages of fiber based evaporator in this area were reviewed and demonstrated. The structure-function relationship between fiber based floating structure and light absorber were analyzed from the perspectives of design and fabrication of light absorber and floating structure, water transportation, as well as thermal management and their mechanisms. Then, pure organic fiber with photothermal properties for SISG was focused on, and future development and challenges of the SISG was discussed. It is believed that the fiber-based evaporation system will play its role in seawater desalination without causing further carbon emission. Â© 2022, Periodical Agency of Journal of Textile Research.

TI  - An adaptable water-based mud system for multiple applications while drilling
AB  - Due to significant variation of the subsurface geology from the surface to the top of reservoir and requirement of different fluid characteristics for drilling various hole sections such as a simple spud mud for surface hole section, an inhibitive drilling fluid for reactive shale section, a salt water-based mud for salt diapirs and salt formations, a high lubricating mud for deviated hole section or for a vertical borehole with a high dogleg severity, there is a need to change the mud system while drilling to overcome the technical challenges associated with these formations and wellbore profiles. The change over from one mud system to another is very important to overcome specific drilling challenges associated with different hole sections of a borehole. There is also a need to clean the mud circulation system adequately before a mud change over to avoid any contamination of the new mud system, especially for displacing a water-based mud by an oil-based mud or an oil-based mud by a water-based mud. It is very important as the contamination of the new mud by the old mud could be the source of major problems due to partial or complete loss of functional ability of the new mud system. An adaptable drilling mud system that can easily be transformed from a spud mud system to an inhibitive or a high lubricating or a salt water mud can provide the industry a versatile fluid system with multiple hole section applications to overcome the NPT associated with mud change over, extra mud cost associated with a totally new mud system and eliminate the scope of mud contamination associated with mixing of the new mud with the old mud during the displacement process. This paper describes a volcanic ash-based drilling mud that can be used as an spud mud to drill the surface hole, can easily be converted to an inhibitive mud system to drill reactive shale sections of a borehole, a salt water-based mud to drill the salt sections and also a high lubricating water-based drilling mud to reduce torque and drag problems in deviated and horizontal boreholes. The fully flexible and easily convertible nature of the base volcanic ash-based drilling mud will reduce total drilling cost significantly due to the elimination of a significant portion of non-productive drilling time associated with mud changeover, cleaning of mud circulation system, new mud preparation, incorporation of the new mud in the circulation system and displacement of the old mud from the borehole by the new mud, etc. Â© 2016, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Conversion of carbon dioxide into several potential chemical commodities following different pathways - a review
AB  - This article reviews the literature related to the direct uses of CO2 and its conversion into various value added chemicals including high energy density liquid fuels such as methanol. The increase in the direct uses of CO2 and its conversion into potential chemical commodities is very important as it directly contributes to the mitigation of CO2 related global warming problem. The method being followed at present in several countries to reduce the CO2 associated global warming is capturing of CO2 at its major outlets using monoethanolamine based solution absorption technique followed by storing it in safe places such as, oceans, depleted coal seams, etc., (i.e., carbon dioxide capturing and storing in safe places, CCS process). This is called as CO2 sequestration. Although, the CCS process is the most understood and immediate option to mitigate the global warming problem, it is considerably expensive and has become a burden for those countries, which are practicing this process. The other alternative and most beneficial way of mitigating this global warming problem is to convert the captured CO2 into certain value added bulk chemicals instead of disposing it. Conversion of CO2 into methanol has been identified as one of such cost effective ways of mitigating global warming problem. Further, if H-2 is produced from exclusively water using only solar energy instead of any fossil fuel based energy, and is used to convert CO2 into methanol there are three major benefits: i) it contributes greatly to the global warming mitigation problem, ii) it greatly saves fossil fuels as methanol production from CO2 could be an excellent sustainable and renewable energy resource, and iii) as on today, there is no better process than this to store energy in a more convenient and highly usable form of high energy density liquid fuel. Not only methanol, several other potential chemicals and value added chemical intermediates can be produced from CO2. In this article, i) synthesis of several commodity chemicals including poly and cyclic-carbonates, sodium carbonate and dimethyl carbonate, carbamates, urea, vicinal diamines, 2-arylsuccinic acids, dimethyl ether, methanol, various hydrocarbons, acetic acid, formaldehyde, formic acid, lower alkanes, etc., from CO2, ii) the several direct uses of CO2, and iii) the importance of producing methanol from CO2 using exclusively solar energy are presented, discussed and summarized by citing all the relevant and important references.

TI  - Natural gas pressurized liquefaction process adopting cascade refrigeration and CO2 removal by anti-sublimation
AB  - To reduce the area of offshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant, a novel natural gas pressurized liquefaction process combined with CO2 removal is put forward in this paper. Taking off CO2 pretreatment facility, the process uses a crystallizer to remove CO2 from natural gas by anti-sublimation during liquefaction process. The process adopts a cascade refrigeration cycle to obtain cooling energy and produce pressurized liquefied natural gas (PLNG), with dry ice as by-product. Because of higher liquefaction temperature in PLNG process, the three-stage cascade refrigeration cycle commonly used in conventional process is replaced by a CH 4/C2H4 two-stage cycle in the proposed process. The natural gas with high CO2 content is firstly cooled at the pressure of about 1.5MPa, until the CO2 fraction is lowered to 0.5%. In this way, most of the CO2 in the feed gas is separated by anti-sublimation. To avoid further freeze-out in the following process, the remaining natural gas is compressed to a higher pressure, and then cooled down until it is liquefied. The performance of the process is simulated with HYSYS software. Taking unit product power consumption as the major index for analysis, the optimum parameters of the process are worked out in this paper. Besides, the effects of CO2 content on power consumption are also investigated, and the results indicate that higher CO2 content in feed gas leads to higher unit product power consumption. Moreover, the optimal values of unit product power consumption show that the novel process can liquefy natural gas at an acceptable energy cost, usually under 0.35 kWh/Nm 3. Therefore, the novel process is a good option for offshore natural gas liquefaction.

The operation of the platform will be based mainly on renewable energy technologies, such as photovoltaics and wind turbines. In order to utilize properly the renewable energy potential, the sea platform will also include batteries and diesel generator, whereas the option of grid interconnection with Crete Island is also examined, in order to purchase and sell its electricity when needed. The alternative options that are examined include different battery autonomy, various funding options, and sensitivity analysis of the results regarding different lending parameters. The financial indices used in this analysis are: net present value, internal rate of return, discounted payback period, and weighted average cost of capital. The results show that the operation of the sea platform can be economically viable if annual incomes of a few hundred thousand euros exist, provided by platforms research activities.

TI  - Determining and optimizing design loads for mobile offshore drilling units using fuel air explosion modeling scenarios
AB  - A study was performed to provide develop guidance regarding design basis blast loads for mobile offshore drilling units (MODU). Release of flammable materials may result in a vapor cloud explosion (VCE) which can apply damaging blast loads to critical areas of the MODU. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modeling was used to perform a dispersion and explosion analysis. This analytical technique is ideally suited to account for offshore geometries and wind patterns. The analysis showed that the controlling loads for the critical areas were from releases on the main deck. The screening level load developed from this study will assist MODU design by providing a defined load case at the initiation of the design process. Â© 2017, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - A Review of Desalination Potential in Greek Islands Using Renewable Energy Sources, a Life Cycle Assessment of Different Units
AB  - The scarcity of water is a long-standing problem in Greek islands. The government, as a temporary solution adopted the transportation of water using tanker ships. This type of water is of low quality non-potable and in some cases inappropriate for any use. Apart from that water transportation increases the carbon footprint of the islands that it is already stained due to the big thermal power plants that feed the grid using fossil fuels (mainly diesel). Apart from the environmental issues the economic consequences are extremely high. The cost of transported water in Dodecanese and Cyclades reached a total of 73,5 million (sic) from 2002 to 2010. The aim of this paper is to bring forward the proposed solutions for desalination of sea water using renewable energy sources, as Greek islands have a great wind and solar potential that is hard to find in any other place on Europe. A Life Cycle Assessment is been conducted between two different desalination technologies (RES and Diesel operating desalination) to fully understand the impact these units have to the environment.

TI  - Sir John Collins looks to the future
AB  - The views of Sir John Collins, President (Elect) of the Energy Institute (EI), on the future of the energy markets and his contribution towards marketing are discussed. He believes that the challenge is to balance the traditional energy policy requirements of security of supply and fuel diversity with the need to have a policy that delivered on emissions targets to ensure that threats from climate change are minimized. Another challenge is to find investors in the new capacity which would require imaginative solutions. He felt that there is a need for fiscal encouragement to stretch out of the North Sea supplies which would enable it to cooperate with others from a position of strength.

TI  - Large diameter steel catenary riser solutions for semi-submersible platforms in offshore northwest Australia
AB  - The offshore northwest Australian sector is dominated by large gas plays and as the sector matures there is an increasing move towards deepwater developments. Riser solutions are key concept selection drivers and often high gas throughputs have led to a drive towards large riser diameters to limit the associated subsea infrastructure. The need for high availability in LNG projects leads to a requirement for high reliability, permanently moored Offshore Facilities. A representative development scenario employs large diameter (18" to 24") import and export Steel Catenary Risers (SCRs) supported by a Semi-submersible platform in 1,400 m water depth. This is potentially the deepest development offshore Australia. It is a relatively novel solution for the region given that the riser solution in the region has been primarily limited to flexible risers. SCR designs are governed by their fatigue performance in the touch down zone (TDZ). Feasibility of the large diameter SCRs is challenged by the Australian sea conditions dominated by southern ocean swells. Several options are considered to enhance the fatigue life of the SCRs. These include increasing the Semi draft to reduce heave motions, aligning the riser plane in a direction normal to the predominantly northeastern swell environment, using upset ends at critical locations to reduce curvature response, lazy wave configuration to decouple vessel motions from TDZ response, and weighted SCR to reduce TDZ response. These options are considered either individually or in a combination thereof. The technical feasibilities of and the challenges associated with these options are discussed. Some of the possible challenges include the manufacturability of upset ends, feasibility of top end terminations and installation of buoyancy modules. A relative cost comparison is also made between the different options. The metocean conditions in offshore Australia are compared with US Gulf of Mexico (GoM), where SCRs have been widely used. Their implications for SCR fatigue and extreme response are explored. Findings that are critical to the riser design include riser porch vertical velocity at extreme conditions, relative contribution of surge/sway versus heave motions to fatigue damage, contribution of vortex induced motions (VIM) to fatigue damage, and effect of long term currents on riser VIV response. Given the relative novelty of SCR applications with a Semi-submersible in offshore Australia, and the challenges associated with fatigue performance of large diameter SCRs in that harsh environment, this paper will serve as a valuable guide for future riser design and field development in the region.

TI  - Carbon Capture, Utilisation & Storage in Offshore Facilities
AB  - A group of technological procedures known as "carbon capture and storage" involve transferring and injecting carbon dioxide (CO2) that has been captured from industrial waste gases into geological formations. The acronym CCUS, or carbon capture, utilization, and storage, is a key technique for reducing emissions that can be used across the energy system. Meeting the fluctuating need for energy while reducing the harmful effects on the environment are two challenges faced by oil and gas production in floating, production, storage, and offloading (FPSO)units. The most crucial operational parameters to reduce energy demand, boost efficiency, and enhance production are identified in this study through the integration of screening analysis and thermodynamic analysis of oil and gas processing plants. Therefore, the primary objectives of this work are to determine how much the operational parameters of an FPSO with carbon capture, use, and storage (CCUS) contribute to the overall effect. The input parameters for the sensitivity analysis are chosen from some thermodynamic and structural design variables. To accomplish the objectives, four machine learning-based screening analysis algorithms-Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) are used. The impact of three actual crude oil compositions with different GORs and CO2 contents is evaluated. The optimal operating pressure settings of CCS greatly minimize the energy consumption and exergy destruction of the main and utility plants, according to a combination of thermodynamic and screening evaluations. The findings also showed that while the total oil output is solely affected by the GOR content, the total power consumption, CCS efficiency, and CCS power consumption are all significantly more sensitive to the fluid reservoir's CO2 content than GOR. The impact of design variable interactions is also critical in affecting the separation efficiency and/or compression unit performance for situations with high CO2 or GOR content.

TI  - Recent advances in offshore pipeline technology
AB  - Since the pioneering construction of the TRANSMED pipeline system across the Sicily channel in the early 80's, offshore pipeline technology has been progressing towards more and more difficult environments. Now the projects envisaged for the 90's are venturing far beyond the challenges of the recent past. The scope of this paper is to present the recent research efforts aimed at tackling the main design aspects of the new challenges. Particular attention will be given to the experiences and achievements on the last few years in transmission pipelines across the European Continental Shelf, e.g. in the Central and Southern North Sea and across the Mediterranean Sea. Technologies, tools and purpose developed criteria will be discussed. The performance of current operating pipeline systems will be reviewed and incentives to rationalize design criteria and guidelines will illustrated.

TI  - CO2 storage potential of basaltic rocks in Iceland and the oceanic ridges
AB  - Iceland is the largest landmass found above sea level at the mid-ocean ridges, about 103,000 km(2) mostly made of basaltic rocks (similar to 90\%). Theoretically much of Iceland could be used for injection of CO2, fully dissolved in water. Most of the pore space in the older rocks is filled with secondary minerals, thus the young and porous basaltic formations, found within the active rift zone and covering about one third of Iceland, are the most feasible for carbon storage onshore. Studies on mineral storage of CO2 in basaltic rocks are still at an early stage. Therefore, natural analogues are important for gaining a better understanding of CO2 fixation in basaltic rocks. Volcanic geothermal systems serve as an applicable analogue since the systems receive considerable amounts of CO2 from magma in the roots of the systems. Wiese et al. {[}1] quantified the amount and spatial distribution of CO2 stored as calcite within the bedrock of three active geothermal systems in Iceland. The results from this study reveal a large storage potential of basaltic rocks and can be used as a guideline for the theoretical potential of CO2 storage in basaltic formations. The largest storage potential lies offshore, with long-term advantages for safe and secure CO2 storage in the mid-ocean ridges. The theoretical mineral CO2 storage capacity of the ocean ridges, using the Icelandic analogue, is orders of magnitude larger than the anticipated release of CO2 caused by burning of all fossil fuel on Earth.

TI  - Automatic tuning of vessel models offshore: A feasibility study usinghigh-precision data from model test
AB  - sufficiently high quality. To test the potential of automaticmodel tuning an established numerical vessel model is subjected to tuning with high-precision data from amodel test with wave disturbance only. This may give information of how well modelling can be achievedusing tuning under favourable conditions and serve as a benchmark for tuning under noisy conditions.In addition the results may give suggestions for improvement of the mathematical model. A prototypetuning software is written in Matlab. The tuning principle is to minimize the output error, i.e. the differencebetween measured and simulated response, by adjusting the model's parameters. For the minimization aquasi-Newton method is used. The tuning software is tested with data from the model test and found tofunction as intended. Examples of tuning are given.,Model-based prediction of vessel response is valuable for planning and execution of marine operations.Response-based operation criteria are expected to give less downtime and cheaper and safer operationsthan criteria based on wave height and wave period. At least this holds if the response model has sufficientaccuracy. The accuracy can in principle be improved by tuning the model using measured inputs and outputs.It is envisioned that an advisory system for planning and execution of marine operations will contain amodule for continuous model improvement based on on-site measurements of excitation and response. Apremise for this is that the measurements be of ,. Â© 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Long-term trends and resilience of seagrass metabolism: A decadal aquatic eddy covariance study
AB  - Seagrass meadows are valued for their ecosystem services, including their role in mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions through `blue carbon' sequestration and storage. This study quantifies the dynamics of whole ecosystem metabolism on daily to interannual timescales for an eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadow using in situ benthic O-2 flux measurements by aquatic eddy covariance over a period of 11 yr. The measurements were part of the Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research study, and covered a relatively stable period of seagrass ecosystem metabolism 6-13 yr after restoration by seeding (2007-2014), a die-off event likely related to persistently high temperatures during peak growing season in 2015, and a partial recovery from 2016 to 2018. This unique sequence provides an unprecedented opportunity to study seagrass resilience to temperature stress. With this extensive data set covering 115 full diel cycles, we constructed an average annual oxygen budget that indicated the meadow was in metabolic balance when averaged over the entire period, with gross primary production and respiration equal to 95 and -94 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), respectively. On an interannual scale, there was a shift in trophic status from balanced to net heterotrophy during the die-off event in 2015, then to net autotrophy as the meadow recovered. The highly dynamic and variable nature of seagrass metabolism captured by our aquatic eddy covariance data emphasizes the importance of using frequent measurements throughout the year to correctly estimate trophic status of seagrass meadows.

TI  - Dredging Intensity: A Spatio-Temporal Indicator for Managing Marine Resources
AB  - The sustainability of offshore sand reserves and the impact of their exploitation for coastal resilience can be assessed by resource managers via GIS. The GIS model to do this requires monitoring of the dredger location (including speed and displacement, if available). The designated borrow area is divided into grid cells, in this example, 100x100m. The aggregate count of positions in each cell can be displayed in a graphic image called a heat map (or density map or timeprint) where various intensities of colors represents the number vessel locations in each designated cell over the entire time period of interest as a surrogate for dredging intensity. Because sand dredging using a trialing hopper dredge is done at slow speeds, the aggregate time that a dredger spends in each cell can be modified by dredger speed to discriminate time spent actually removing sand from time spent in transit. If vessel displacements is also monitored, increases in displacement will also identify times and locations of active extraction. In this way, areas of disturbed benthic habitat can be identified, even if changes in bathymetry are not resolved.

TI  - Hydrate management for hydrate deposition in gas-filled vertical pipes
AB  - Deadlegs are defined as pipe sections in intermittent use for production or special services in oil/gas production systems. Deadlegs often pose hydrate control challenges to gas and oil production systems as the fluid inside is close to stagnant and therefore can be rapidly cooled by the environment without proper insulation or heat tracing. Water vapor can condense in the deadleg, resulting in a potential hydrate risk. Over time the deadleg may be blocked completely by hydrates. The hydrate challenges, if not properly managed, can cause severe consequences in terms of safety and cost for oil/gas productions. A systematic study has been performed to better understand the process and mechanism of hydrate deposition in deadlegs. To study hydrate deposition in deadlegs experimentally, laboratory scale deadleg systems were designed and built to consider pipe sizes of 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-in. inner diameter and approximately 50 in. long. The pipes were gas-filled and saturated with water from a reservoir at the bottom of the pipe. The experimental work focused on measuring hydrate deposition, and in some cases, plugging, for different water reservoir temperatures (30 to 80 Â°C), pipe wall temperatures (-10 to 15 Â°C), and duration (1 to 84 days). The results from measurements provided insights into the dynamic process of hydrate deposition, such as the mechanism for hydrate deposition, plugging, and distribution along the pipe.

TI  - Energy, Exergy, and Thermo-Economic Analysis of Renewable Energy-Driven Polygeneration Systems for Sustainable Desalination
AB  - Reliable production of freshwater and energy is vital for tackling two of the most critical issues the world is facing today: climate change and sustainable development. In this light, a comprehensive review is performed on the foremost renewable energy-driven polygeneration systems for freshwater production using thermal and membrane desalination. Thus, this review is designed to outline the latest developments on integrated polygeneration and desalination systems based on multi-stage flash (MSF), multi-effect distillation (MED), humidification-dehumidification (HDH), and reverse osmosis (RO) technologies. Special attention is paid to innovative approaches for modelling, design, simulation, and optimization to improve energy, exergy, and thermo-economic performance of decentralized polygeneration plants accounting for electricity, space heating and cooling, domestic hot water, and freshwater production, among others. Different integrated renewable energy-driven polygeneration and desalination systems are investigated, including those assisted by solar, biomass, geothermal, ocean, wind, and hybrid renewable energy sources. In addition, recent literature applying energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental analysis is reviewed to establish a comparison between a range of integrated renewable-driven polygeneration and desalination systems.

TI  - Feasibility of using hindcast data for fatigue assessment of permanently moored offshore units in west-Africa
AB  - To register the wave loads acting on offshore floating structures, wave buoys have been the generally accepted as the most accurate method. However, over the last couple of years, hindcast data has become increasingly accurate. The availability of this data allows assessment of the response of offshore floating structure without the need of local wave buoys. The accuracy when using hindcast data to assess fatigue accumulation on FPSO hulls is assessed in this paper. For this analysis, calculations have been executed for multiple spread-moored production units in the West-Africa region. The purposely deployed wave buoys provide a full wave spectrum including multiple wave components and directional variation of the wave energy. This data is used to derive statistical data description of the sea state. In this paper, we consider the use of WaveWatch III, ERA-5 and Copernicus hindcast models. These are all models which provide sea state descriptions on a global scale. The statistical data from the hindcast models is compared against the reference data provided by the wave buoys. Overall, the three models provide decent results in this mild environment. However, it is found that Copernicus provides more accurate estimates for the larger wave heights. Fatigue analyses have been executed. The full spectral data provided by the wave buoys is used to conduct a spectral fatigue assessment. The hindcast models generally provide more limited details of the sea state, information such as spectral shapes and directional spreading may be missing. Understanding the influence of these missing characteristics is vital for reliable long term fatigue assessment. Multiple fatigue analyses have been executed to examine the sensitivity to these missing characteristics. It has been shown that the multi-modality of the sea state and spectral shape are the most important parameters driving the deviation between the fatigue assessment based on hindcast data and wave buoy data. These differences can accumulate to a factor of 2 on lifetime consumption. The influence of the accuracy of the statistical parameters provided by the hindcast models and wave spreading is considerably less with a typical contribution of around 30% on lifetime consumption.

TI  - New Structural Seismic Isolation for Nuclear Containment Structures
AB  - The new Structural Seismic Isolation System (SSIS) intends to provide high safety for important structures such as nuclear power plants, offshore oil platforms, and high-rise buildings against near-fault and long-period earthquakes. The presented SSIS structure foot base and foundation contact surfaces have been designed as any curved surfaces (spherical, elliptical, etc.) depending on the earthquake-soil-superstructure parameters, and these contact surfaces have been separated by using elastomeric (lead core rubber or laminated rubber bearings with up to 4-second period) seismic isolation devices. It would allow providing inverse pendulum behavior to the structure. As a result of this behavior, the natural period of the structure will possess greater intervals which are larger than the predominant period of the majority of the possible earthquakes including near-fault zones. Consequently, the structure can maintain its serviceability after the occurrence of strong and long-period earthquakes. This study has investigated the performance of the SSIS for the nuclear containment (SSIS-NC) structure. The finite element model of SISS-NC structure has been developed, and nonlinear dynamic analysis of the model has been conducted under the strong and long-period ground motions. The results have been presented in comparison with the conventional application method of the seismic base isolation devices for nuclear containment (CAMSBID-NC) and fixed base nuclear containment (FB-NC) structures. The base and top accelerations, effective stress, and critical shear stress responses of the SSIS-NC structure are 48.67%, 36.70%, and 32.60% on average lower than those of CAMSBID-NC structure, respectively. The result also confirms that the SSIS-NC structure did not cause resonant vibrations under long-period earthquakes. On the other hand, there is excessive deformation in the isolation layers of CAMSBID-NC structure. Â© 2020 Azer A. Kasimzade et al.

TI  - CO2-Driven Ocean Acidification Alters and Weakens Integrity of the Calcareous Tubes Produced by the Serpulid Tubeworm, Hydroides elegans
AB  - As a consequence of anthropogenic CO2-driven ocean acidification (OA), coastal waters are becoming increasingly challenging for calcifiers due to reductions in saturation states of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) minerals. The response of calcification rate is one of the most frequently investigated symptoms of OA. However, OA may also result in poor quality calcareous products through impaired calcification processes despite there being no observed change in calcification rate. The mineralogy and ultrastructure of the calcareous products under OA conditions may be altered, resulting in changes to the mechanical properties of calcified structures. Here, the warm water biofouling tubeworm, Hydroides elegans, was reared from larva to early juvenile stage at the aragonite saturation state (Omega(A)) for the current pCO(2) level (ambient) and those predicted for the years 2050, 2100 and 2300. Composition, ultrastructure and mechanical strength of the calcareous tubes produced by those early juvenile tubeworms were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nanoindentation. Juvenile tubes were composed primarily of the highly soluble CaCO3 mineral form, aragonite. Tubes produced in seawater with aragonite saturation states near or below one had significantly higher proportions of the crystalline precursor, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) and the calcite/aragonite ratio dramatically increased. These alterations in tube mineralogy resulted in a holistic deterioration of the tube hardness and elasticity. Thus, in conditions where Omega(A) is near or below one, the aragonite-producing juvenile tubeworms may no longer be able to maintain the integrity of their calcification products, and may result in reduced survivorship due to the weakened tube protection.

TI  - Modelling of a novel hydro-pneumatic accumulator for large-scale offshore energy storage applications
AB  - Despite the ability of accumulators to smooth out fluctuations in small-scale hydraulic circuits, their use in multi-megawatt power transmission systems remains limited. This is due to the large pressure variations that they experience as their state-of-charge changes when their energy capacity is large. The present work highlights an approach whereby the pressure fluctuations are absorbed by a larger external volume of compressed air. This system has been integrated into a novel floating platform for offshore applications. A thermodynamic model of the gas compression process is developed in order to observe temperature and pressure fluctuations. A brief parametric analysis is undertaken to illustrate the effect of critical system dimensions. This comprises the effect of the external volume with respect to the accumulator volume and the diameter of the umbilical connecting the two components. The system is also simulated in different climates to observe the interaction between the external seawater temperature and the internal gas thermodynamics. A full charge-discharge cycle is simulated and results indicate that around 95% of the energy can be recovered after being stored for a 24-h period. The operational efficiency for a stochastic energy input was also computed and found to be relatively high. Electrical round-trip efficiency was found to be comparable to adiabatic and near-isothermal CAES, but the system can be more advantageous when integrated into the generation-side. The key attribute is the minimization of pressure fluctuations, which results in minimal deviations from the equilibrium temperature. This reduces thermal losses to the surroundings and results in a highly efficient energy storage system. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Time synchronization and data transfer method for towed electromagnetic receiver
AB  - Deep marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) prospecting has attracted extensive interest because it enables high efficiency and high horizontal-resolution prospecting of gas hydrate and oil. However, the elimination of time errors between the transmitter and the receiver and realization of long-distance high-speed real-time data transmission (submarine towed body status information and raw electromagnetic field data stream) are worthwhile challenges that require continuous effort. We developed a novel towed CSEM system using double-vessels that have high time synchronization accuracy and real-time data transmission. The near-seafloor-towed CSEM receiver contains a deck user terminal, master node, slave nodes, tail buoy, and neutrally buoyant towed cable. The deck user terminal generated and transmitted a pulse per second to the master node through a fiber converter and optical fiber. The RS-485 transceiver then turned the pulse signal into a differential signal and transmitted it to each slave node for error-free synchronization. The time information was also transmitted from the deck user terminal to various nodes through ethernet switches, optical fibers, and serial to ethernet converters. The deck user terminal can conveniently communicate with each node cascaded by the ethernet switch through ethernet and fiber optic communication technology. During an offshore experiment involving oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea, the towed CSEM receiver continuously acquired all electromagnetic components and status information, which achieved a preliminary prospecting result. The maximum transfer rate of real-time data can reach 10 Mbps with 300 m distance between each slave node, and the time synchronization error between transmitter and receiver is less than Â±3 Î¼s.

The calcined CaO can be easily dissociated to Ca2+ cation and CO32- anion by hydrolysis and gas-liquid carbonation reaction and converted to precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) in algae-containing water. The calcium hydroxide and carbonation combination in algae-containing water significantly contributed to improving water quality which is very dependent on the addition amount of calcined powders.

TI  - A Gas Path Fault Contribution Matrix for Marine Gas Turbine Diagnosis Based on a Multiple Model Fault Detection and Isolation Approach
AB  - To ensure reliable and efficient operation of gas turbines, multiple model (MM) approaches have been extensively studied for online fault detection and isolation (FDI). However, current MM-FDI approaches are difficult to directly apply to gas path FDI, which is one of the common faults in gas turbines and is understood to mainly be due to the high complexity and computation in updating hypothetical gas path faults for online applications. In this paper, a fault contribution matrix (FCM) based MM-FDI approach is proposed to implement gas path FDI over a wide operating range. As the FCM is realized via an additive term of the healthy model set, the hypothetical models for various gas path faults can be easily established and updated online. In addition, a gap metric analysis method for operating points selection is also proposed, which yields the healthy model set from the equal intervals linearized models to approximate the nonlinearity of the gas turbine over a wide range of operating conditions with specified accuracy and computational efficiency. Simulation case studies conducted on a two-shaft marine gas turbine demonstrated the proposed approach is capable of adaptively updating hypothetical model sets to accurately differentiate both single and multiple faults of various gas path faults.

TI  - Seagrass meadows improve inflowing water quality in aquaculture ponds
AB  - Water quality is critical for fish health in aquaculture production. In flow-through systems, the inflowing water normally requires quality controls and treatments for being supplied from coastal water bodies that can be polluted by nutrients, suspended solids, and microorganisms. Here we assess how seagrass meadows benefit aquaculture systems through the provision of ecosystem services (water filtration, biological control, and regulation of dissolved gasses) in the water reservoir that supplies earthen ponds in an aquaculture system in southern Portugal. In the 1.45-ha reservoir, seagrasses retained daily an estimate of 0.8-1.8 kg d(-1) of nitrogen, 0.04-0.07 kg d(-1) of phosphorus in their biomass, and 0.7-1.1 kg dw d(-1) of suspended total particulate matter, bringing benefits in terms of nutrient and particle removal from the water column. Diel and spatial variation in faecal coliforms levels (Escherichia coli) in the reservoir suggested that seagrasses, in combination with light exposure, may reduce the levels of this pathogen. Furthermore, the seagrass-dominated system oxygenated the water through photosynthesis at a faster rate than the respiratory oxygen consumption, maintaining the system above the aquaculture minimum oxygen. This study demonstrates that seagrasses can be used as a nature-based solution to overcome water quality challenges in flow-through aquaculture ponds.

TI  - MoC-Based modeling and simulation of foam EOR processes in multi-layered system
AB  - Foam injection is a promising means to improve field-scale displacement efficiency, especially when a reservoir consists of multiple geological layers, the connectivity of which is minimal or absent due to the shale layers embedded in between. This study is devoted to investigating how foam EOR processes work in such heterogeneous and layered reservoir systems overcoming subsurface heterogeneity by using fractional flow analysis. This study first shows how to interpret theoretically the injection of surfactant pre flush and following foams into a single-layer system at pre-specified rock and fluid properties, and then extends the knowledge gained into multi-layer systems where the properties vary in different layers. The results in general show that the mechanisms of foam displacement strongly depends on foam properties such as gas-phase mobility reduction factors (MRF), limiting water saturation (Swâˆ—), and critical oil saturation (S0âˆ—) as well as petrophysical properties of individual layers such as porosity (Ï†), permeability (k), relative permeability, capillary pressure (Pc) and so on. The overall sweep efficiency in a multi-layer system is very difficult to predict because of the complexity, but the mathematical framework presented in this study is shown to handle the problem successfully and reliably. A ID foam simulator developed in this study is used for verification purpose. Copyright Â© (2015) by the Offshore Technology Conference All rights reserved.

TI  - Potential climate-driven changes to seabird demography: implications for assessments of marine renewable energy development
AB  - Europe has set ambitious green energy targets, to which offshore renewable developments (ORDs) will make a significant contribution. Governments are legally required to deliver ORDs sustainably; however, they may have detrimental impacts on wildlife, especially those already experiencing declines due to climate change. Population viability analysis (PVA) is the standard method for forecasting population change in ORD assessments, but PVAs do not currently account for climate effects. We quantified climate effects on seabird breeding success for 8 UK species breeding in the North Sea. We assessed the potential for seabirds to mitigate climate-driven changes in breeding success by accessing wider resources through increased foraging ranges around colonies. We demonstrate strong links between breeding success and climate in 5 species. In 4 of these species, future climate projections indicated large declines in breeding success relative to current rates. Only one species was predicted to increase breeding success under future climate. In all 5 species, there was limited opportunity for species to increase breeding success by expanding foraging ranges to access more suitable future climatic conditions. Climate change will have significant ramifications for future breeding success of seabirds breeding in the North Sea, an area undergoing extensive and rapid offshore renewable energy development. We recommend 3 methods for including climate-driven changes to seabird breeding success within ORD assessments: development of predictive climate-driven habitat use models to estimate ORD-wildlife interactions; delivery of a new ORD assessment framework that includes dynamic predictions of climate-driven habitat use and demography of wildlife populations; and consideration of climate-driven changes in the implementation of compensatory measures.

TI  - Climate impact of biofuels in shipping: Global model studies of the aerosol indirect effect
AB  - Aerosol emissions from international shipping are recognized to have a large impact on the Earth's radiation budget, directly by scattering and absorbing solar radiation and indirectly by altering cloud properties. New regulations have recently been approved by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) aiming at progressive reductions of the maximum sulfur content allowed in marine fuels from current 4.5% by mass down to 0.5% in 2020, with more restrictive limits already applied in some coastal regions. In this context, we use a global bottom-up algorithm to calculate geographically resolved emission inventories of gaseous (NOx, CO, SO2) and aerosol (black carbon, organic matter, sulfate) species for different kinds of low-sulfur fuels in shipping. We apply these inventories to study the resulting changes in radiative forcing, attributed to particles from shipping, with the global aerosol-climate model EMAC-MADE. The emission factors for the different fuels are based on measurements at a test bed of a large diesel engine. We consider both fossil fuel (marine gas oil) and biofuels (palm and soy bean oil) as a substitute for heavy fuel oil in the current (2006) fleet and compare their climate impact to that resulting from heavy fuel oil use. Our simulations suggest that ship-induced surface level concentrations of sulfate aerosol are strongly reduced, up to about 40-60% in the high-traffic regions. This clearly has positive consequences for pollution reduction in the vicinity of major harbors. Additionally, such reductions in the aerosol loading lead to a decrease of a factor of 3-4 in the indirect global aerosol effect induced by emissions from international shipping.

TI  - IEA calls for global action on climate change
AB  - According to International Energy Agency (IEA) new estimates, global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2012 increased by 1.4% increase globally, reaching a record high of 31.6 Gton. This indicates the failure of national and international pledges to limit a rise in global temperature increases over the long term. If greenhouse gas emitted continue to such high levels, the global temperatures are likely to rise between 3.6Â° and 5.3Â°C, according to IEA executive director Maria van der Hoeven. This could have disastrous environmental consequences, such as rising sea levels, and would extract a huge economic and social cost. The four main ways to stop the growth of global GHG emissions by 2020 at no net economic cost, which are set in IEA's "4-for-2 degree Celsius", are discussed.

TI  - High-Pressure CO2 Excess Sorption Measurements on Powdered and Core Samples of High-Rank Coals from Different Depths and Locations of the South Wales Coalfield
AB  - The experimental analysis aimed at investigating the high-pressure (sub- and supercritical) CO2 sorption behavior on two high-rank coals of different sizes is presented in this paper. Coals from the same seam (9 ft seam) but from depths of 150 m {[}black diamond (BD) coal] and 550 m [}Aberpergwm (AB) coal] and different locations of the South Wales (UK) coalfield, known to be strongly affected by tectonically developed fracture systems, are employed for that purpose. Hence, the sorption behavior of powdered (0.25-0.85, 2.36-4.0 mm) and core samples obtained from locations associated with the deformation-related changes is analyzed in this paper to assess the CO2 storage potential of such coals. The results show that the coals exhibit maximum adsorption capacities up to 1.93 mol/kg (BD coal) and 1.82 mol/kg (AB coal). No dependence of the CO2 maximum sorption capacity with respect to the sample size for the BD coal is observed, whereas for the AB coal the maximum sorption capacity is reduced by more than half between the powdered and core samples. The CO2 sorption rates on the BD coal decrease by a factor of more than 9 from 0.25-0.85 to 2.36-4.0 mm and then remain relatively constant with further increase in sample size. The opposite is observed for the AB coal where sorption rates decrease with increasing sample size, that is, reducing by a factor of more than 100 between the 0.25-0.85 mm and core samples. The differences in behavior are interpreted through the structure each coal exhibits associated with the burial depths and sampling locations as well as through the minor variations in ash contents. This study demonstrates that anthracite coals, having experienced sufficient deformation, resulting in changes in fracture frequency, can adsorb significant amounts of CO2, offering great prospect to be considered as a CO2 sequestration option.

TI  - Integration of energy storage technology and wind generator for power stabilization
AB  - The conventional energy sources are depleting drastically. The engineers and practitioners have to overcome challenge for fulfillment of tremendous growth in the demand of electrical power. The option is to think about the renewable energy sources, providing the clean output. The renewable includes solar energy sources, wind energy, pumped storage scheme, tidal energy etc. The major drawbacks of the renewable are the variable and intermittent output. The output depends upon the naturally available uncontrolled input. Due this major drawbacks in integrating such a sources with a grid while fulfilling the grid specification, the upcoming research uses various energy storage technologies to smooth the output of renewable before injecting in to the grid. This paper includes the energy storage technologies as fuel cell and super capacitor for mitigating the output fluctuation of wind power farm. In this paper the simulation with hybrid ESS (energy storage system) for smoothing the power output in wind farm is discussed. The system is validated with simulation in MATLAB 7. Â© 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Integration of wearable technology for inspection tasks
AB  - Greater complexity in offshore assets has introduced operational changes that impact the ways in which services are provided. Keeping pace with this evolution has led to an increased interest in emerging technologies that can be used in inspection tasks. Implementation of wearable technologies provides a way to capture and visualize information more efficiently, streamline inspection services, and integrate onsite, real-time information capture, thus allowing for more informed and rapid decision-making as well as alternative approaches to planning, execution, and reporting. Wearable devices can both collect and deliver data in the field, creating a synergy that enables the focus to remain on the task at hand while being able to automatically obtain access to relevant resources. Wearable technology allows field personnel to immediately and effectively capture, share, and collaborate with real time information, hands free. Wearables can also bridge time and distance constraints imposed by having a worldwide enterprise, and enable more informed, real-time decision making. With advanced visualization and augmentation, contextual data can be super-imposed on reality providing interactive job aids, ease of access to asset history, and current state asset health with digital capture of records/narratives. This technology can provide faster, more dynamic intelligence and direction to help quickly identify specific areas of interest for targeted inspection applications. Incorporation of wearable technologies follows a phased approach. The first step is to look at ways of improving current systems and identifying what processes can be adjusted for increased efficiency and safety. The second phase leverages the use of sensor technology in collecting and analyzing data to improve processes by enhancing data capture and providing additional connectivity. The third phase focuses on creating new processes and developing broader capabilities by building a knowledge base from collected and analyzed data. This phase requires datato be collected, categorized and indexed to identify patterns. The end result of following a structured implementation process is the ability to incorporate ambient intelligence and augmented reality to enable risk-informed decision-making and support efficient execution of inspection tasks. This paper will primarily address phase 1 activities as well as discuss the driving factors for the use of wearable technology in the offshore industry, the current and future capabilities and use cases for wearable technology, as well as experience, lessons learned, and next steps in the implementation process.

TI  - Effect of Forest Structural Change on Carbon Storage in a Coastal Metasequoia glyptostroboides Stand
AB  - Forest structural change affects the forest's growth and the carbon storage. Two treatments, thinning (30\% thinning intensity) and underplanting plus thinning, are being implemented in a coastal Metasequoia glyptostroboides forest shelterbelt in Eastern China. The vegetation carbon storage significantly increased in the underplanted and thinned treatments compared with that in the unthinned treatment (P < 0.05). The soil and litterfall carbon storage in the underplanted treatment were significantly higher than those in the unthinned treatment (P < 0.05). The total forest ecosystem carbon storage in the underplanted and thinned treatments increased by 35.3\% and 26.3\%, respectively, compared with that in the unthinned treatment, an increase that mainly came from the growth of vegetation aboveground. Total ecosystem carbon storage showed no significant difference between the underplanted and thinned treatments (P > 0.05). The soil light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) was significantly higher at the 0-15 cm soil layer in the thinned and underplanted stands compared with that in the unthinned stand (P < 0.05). The soil respiration of the underplanted treatment was significantly higher than that of the unthinned treatment only in July (P < 0.05). This study concludes that 30\% thinning and underplanting after thinning could be more favorable to carbon sequestration for M. glyptostroboides plantations in the coastal areas of Eastern China.

TI  - High integrity pressure protection systems for production applications
AB  - Through the use of a High Integrity Pressure Protection System (HIPPS) the flare capacity of a wellhead platform can be reduced to theflowrate required for depressurisation. The HIPPS may also be used to reduce the flare capacity of a process plant. By the use of HIPPS, the discharge of hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide due to venting/flaring is reduced. This paper describes the development of HIPPS for the Sleipner B-platform offshore Norway. A 20" multiphase pipeline is protected against overpressure by two 20" quick acting shut down valves (QSV) installed in series, instead of pressure safety valves. The valves have been qualified for operation in wellstream at a shut-in pressure of 336 bar, and have a closing time of 2 seconds. Each of the QSVs has independent, fail safe instrumentation cirquits. A parallel train of QSVs has been installed due to the testing requirements. The estimated saving using HIPPS on SLB was 5 25 mill. The paper also discuss existing and new applications of the HIPPS. Â© 1995, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Enhancement of CO2 Mineralization in Ca2+-/Mg2+-Rich Aqueous Solutions Using Insoluble Amine
AB  - The potential for using concentrated seawater to fix CO2 by adding insoluble amine extractant was tested and verified. The experimental results showed that over 90\% of Ca2+ ions could be converted to precipitation. Ammonia was chosen as regenerant to regenerate the extracting agent; the regeneration rate can reach 95\%. On the basis of the analysis of MgCO3 precipitation properties, a new CO2 mineralization process was proposed in which CaO is employed to react with Mg2+ in solution. Mg(OH)(2) precipitation and Ca2+-rich aqueous solutions were produced, and both performed well in CO2 mineralization. This new process can produce different kinds of byproducts such as MgCO3, CaCO3, and NH4Cl. Since there is no energy consumption from phase separation, nor is there a heat requirement, it is therefore definitely less energy intensive. This approach has great application potential.

TI  - Mangrove sinkholes (cenotes) of the Yucatan Peninsula, a global hotspot of carbon sequestration
AB  - Mangroves are among the most carbon-dense ecosystems on the planet. The capacity of mangroves to store and accumulate carbon has been assessed and reported at regional, national and global scales. However, small-scale sampling is still revealing `hot spots' of carbon accumulation. This study reports one of these hotspots, with one of the largest-recorded carbon stocks in mangroves associated with sinkholes (cenotes) in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We assessed soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, sequestration rates and carbon origin of deep peat soils (1 to 6 m). We found massive amounts of SOC up to 2792 Mg C ha(-1), the highest value reported in the literature so far. This SOC is primarily derived from highly preserved mangrove roots and has changed little since its deposition, which started over 3220 years ago (+/- 30 BP). Most cenotes are owned by Mayan communities and are threatened by increased tourism and the resulting extraction and pollution of groundwater. These hot spots of carbon sequestration, albeit small in area, require adequate protection and could provide valuable financial opportunities through carbon-offsetting mechanisms and other payments for ecosystem services.

TI  - Remote community electrification
AB  - Small remote communities often lack basic utilities such as electricity supply for lighting, refrigeration, communications etc. It is usually uneconomic to provide mains power, even when high voltage lines pass by a village. Diesel-powered generators require fuel which is expensive and difficult to bring into remote areas. They are noisy and they require maintenance which is neglected in remote area. Neither wind nor sun provide reliable power in humid tropical regions where there is a lot of still, overcast weather, even when wind turbines or solar panels can be located above the trees. Towers attract lightning strikes which can destroy electronic controls, fungus grows on solar panels, and the multiple electrical connections on photovoltaic arrays corrode away in hot, humid climates. Micro-hydro is an attractive option in mountainous areas, and author 1 has built a 30 kw high head and a 3 kw low head plant, using village labor, surplus and discarded materials. Both are operating satisfactorily. However conventional micro-hydro is not possible in flat country where there is little elevation, and work is now in progress (by the team) to evaluate suitable hydrokinetic turbines on rivers in the humid tropics. Numerous companies around the world are now developing hydrokinetic turbines to harvest tidal and river flows, but a major problem with most designs is clogging by floating debris, which could be worst when used in tropical rivers.

TI  - The production and processing of marginal and/or difficult fields: North morecambe onshore terminal
AB  - The North Morecambe Area Development is located in the Irish Sea approximately 38 km South-West of Barrow. It consists of three separate fields with estimated recoverable reserves of 1 Tcf. Utilization of North Morecambe gas required a wide range of processes due to significant quantities of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. The overall philosophy on the North Morecambe project was to minimize plant and processing facilities offshore such that the platform could be considered 'not normally manned'. In order to locate the majority of equipment onshore, a wet sea line was required with methanol acting both as a hydrate inhibitor and as a carrier for a corrosion inhibitor. To meet National Transmission specifications, the gas required the removal of all the carbon dioxide, some of the nitrogen as well as the more conventional conditioning requirements of separation, condensate stabilization and sweetening, hydrocarbon and water dewpoint control, compression and methanol recovery, making it the most complex gas processing terminal in Europe. The paper will review the overall process route, the choice of processing facilities, taking into account declining field pressures/flows and the development of new satellite fields with varying gas compositions feeding the terminal, as well as the commissioning of the plant in 1994 and its current operability.

This innovative public-private collaboration will help in reducing diesel emissions along the US west coast. West Coast Collaborative partners have implemented more than 80 projects in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, California, Nevada, Arizona, and Hawaii. The collaborative partners have contributed US$40 million to enlarge their projects and achieve significant reductions in diesel emissions.

TI  - Global carbon stocks and potential emissions due to mangrove deforestation from 2000 to 2012
AB  - Mangrove forests store high densitie of organic carbon, which, when coupled with high rates of deforestation, means that mangroves have the potential to contribute substantially to carbon emissions. Consequently, mangroves are strong candidates for inclusion in nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and payments for ecosystem services (PES) programmes that financially incentivize the conservation of forested carbon stocks. This study quantifies annual mangrove carbon stocks from 2000 to 2012 at the global, national and sub-national levels, and global carbon emissions resulting from deforestation over the same time period. Globally, mangroves stored 4.19 Pg of carbon in 2012, with Indonesia, Brazil, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea accounting for more than 50\% of the global stock. 2.96 Pg of the global carbon stock is contained within the soil and 1.23 Pg in the living biomass. Two percent of global mangrove carbon was lost between 2000 and 2012, equivalent to a maximum potential of 316,996,250 t of CO2 emissions.

TI  - The greenhouse gas offset potential from seagrass restoration
AB  - Awarding CO2 offset credits may incentivize seagrass restoration projects and help reverse greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from global seagrass loss. However, no study has quantified net GHG removal from the atmosphere from a seagrass restoration project, which would require coupled C-org stock and GHG flux enhancement measurements, or determined whether the creditable offset benefit can finance the restoration. We measured all of the necessary GHG accounting parameters in the 7-km(2) Zostera marina (eelgrass) meadow in Virginia, U.S.A., part of the largest, most cost-effective meadow restoration to date, to provide the first seagrass offset finance test-of-concept. Restoring seagrass removed 9,600 tCO(2) from the atmosphere over 15 years but also enhanced both CH4 and N2O production, releasing 950 tCO(2)e. Despite tripling the N2O flux to 0.06gm(-2) yr(-1) and increasing CH4 8-fold to 0.8gm(-2) yr(-1), the meadow now offsets 0.42 tCO(2)e ha(-1) yr(-1), which is roughly equivalent to the seagrass sequestration rate for GHG inventory accounting but lower than the rates for temperate and tropical forests. The financial benefit for this highly successful project, \$87K at \$10 MtCO(2)e(-1), defrays similar to 10\% of the restoration cost. Managers should also consider seagrass co-benefits, which provide additional incentives for seagrass restoration.

TI  - Fucoid brown algae inject fucoidan carbon into the ocean
AB  - Brown algae annually convert gigatons of carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, including the complex extracellular matrix polysaccharide fucoidan. Due to its persistence in the environment, fucoidan is potentially a pathway for marine carbon sequestration. Rates of fucoidan secretion by brown algae remain unknown due to the challenge of identifying and quantifying complex polysaccharides in seawater. We adapted the techniques of anion exchange chromatography, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and biocatalytic enzyme-based assay for detection and quantification of fucoidan. We found the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus at the Baltic Sea coast of south-west Finland to secrete 0.3% of their biomass as fucoidan per day. Dissolved fucoidan concentrations in seawater adjacent to algae reached up to 0.48 mg L-1. Fucoidan accumulated during incubations of F. vesiculosus, significantly more in light than in darkness. Maximum estimation by acid hydrolysis indicated fucoidan secretion at a rate of 28 to 40 mg C kg-1 h-1, accounting for 44 to 50% of all exuded dissolved organic carbon. Composed only of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur, fucoidan secretion does not consume nutrients enabling carbon sequestration independent of algal growth. Extrapolated over a year, the algae sequester more carbon into secreted fucoidan than their biomass. The global utility of fucoidan secretion is an alternative pathway for carbon dioxide removal by brown algae without the need to harvest or bury algal biomass. Â© 2022 the Author(s).

TI  - A novel ocean bathymetry technology based on an unmanned surface vehicle
AB  - In ocean bathymetry, the instantaneous depth measured by survey ships or by unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) cannot be directly taken as the chart depth because of the effect of waves and the tide. A novel ocean bathymetry technology is proposed based on the USV, the aim is to evaluate the potential of the USV using a real-time kinematic (RTK) and a single beam echo sounder for ocean bathymetry. First, using the RTK height of the USV with centimeter-level precision, the height of the sea level is obtained by excluding wave information using a low pass filter. Second, the datum distance between the reference ellipsoid and the chart depth is obtained by a novel method using tide tables and the height of the sea level from the USV. Previous work has usually achieved this using long-term tidal observation from traditional investigations. Finally, the chart depth is calculated using the transformation between the instantaneous depth of the USV measurement and the datum of the chart depth. Experiments were performed around the Wuzhizhou Island in Hainan Province using the unmanned surface bathymetry vehicle to validate the proposed technology. The successful results indicate the potential of the bathymetry technology based on the USV.

TI  - Desalination technology waste streams: Effect of pH and salinity on metabolism of marine microbial assemblages
AB  - Effluents from desalination technologies may influence natural bacterial assemblages due to changes in salinity, pH, dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC), DOC quality and cellular hydrostatic pressure. Salinity, pH, and pressure change effects on heterotrophic bacterial production (as measured by leucine incorporation) were examined in experiments with surface water from the Delaware Bay, Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean. Bacterial production decreased by 57-67\% when salinity of Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay surface water samples were increased from ambient to 60 PSU. Decreasing ambient seawater pH from 8.0 to below 5.0 with CO2 gas reduced production by 96-100\%. Decreasing seawater pH by 1.5 units at 33 PSU caused equivalent inhibition to increasing salinity by 27 PSU (pH 8.0). Bacterial production in Pacific Ocean surface water pressurized for 72 h was decreased 40\% by increasing salinity, when measured I h after decompression. However, production increased 43\% with increasing salinity when, measured 24 h after decompression. One explanation for these divergent effects between the 1- and 24-h sampling at ambient pH may be community adaptation. Strains amongst the natural assemblage that survived the pressurization by saturating their membrane phospholipids would likely be better adapted to compete for available nutrients under elevated salinity.

TI  - Recent developments of titanium dioxide materials for aquatic antifouling application
AB  - Biological fouling is undesirable accumulation of various organisms on submerged artificial surfaces. Combating biological fouling on watercrafts and immersed infrastructures is an eternal pursuit since ancient times. Traditionally, toxins, such as arsenic, mercury and tributyltin, were used as antifoulants on ship hulls but they are very harmful to both human and environment. Therefore, worldwide ban on these toxins has been implemented and other toxins with relatively lower environmental impact were used in antifouling coatings along with copper compounds. Unfortunately, these materials still pose a threat to various marine organisms. To completely eliminate this threat, coatings with complete absence of toxic materials have been developed. Nevertheless, these coatings have their own deficiencies, for instance, foul release coatings cannot protect stationary objects. In the past decade, many articles reported that titanium dioxide (TiO2) opens up new possibilities for antifouling materials. This article reports the current development of TiO2 containing materials for antifouling applications.

TI  - The economic evaluation of carbon storage and sequestration as ecosystem services of mangroves: A case study from southeastern Brazil
AB  - Although mangroves are recognized by high capacity of carbon storage and sequestration, few studies have been dedicated to determine the monetary value of this ecosystem service. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to assign monetary values to this service in a protected area (Southeastern Brazil). This economic valuation was performed considering preexisting estimates of carbon storage and sequestration in the aboveground biomass of these forests and average transaction values of carbon credits. The mean values of the service of carbon sequestration varied according to the physiographic type from 19.00 Â± 10.00 US$ ha-1 yr-1 (basin forests, high intertidal) to 82.28 Â± 32.10 US$ ha-1 yr-1 (fringe forests, low intertidal). Considering the area occupied by each physiographic type, the service of carbon sequestration may be worth up to 455,827 US$ yr-1. In regard to carbon storage, 3,477,041 US$ are stored in these forests, and values between 104,311 and 208,622 US$ ha-1 yr-1 can be considered as the annual maintenance cost of this service.

TI  - Impact of wood harvesting on mangrove forest structure, composition and biomass dynamics in India
AB  - Mangrove forest are used widely for meeting fuelwood needs of local communities in the tropics. However, the implications of fuelwood extraction on mangrove ecology has received very little attention. In this study, we investigated the impact of such small-scale fuelwood harvesting practices on mangrove forest structure, composition, regeneration, and biomass and carbon stocks in a protected area on the east coast of India. We sampled vegetation plots in areas where harvesting was practised and where no harvesting was observed. We found that species composition differed across forest categories with Exoecaria aggalocha and Heriteria fomes dominating non-harvested forest types and Sonneratia apetela, Sonneratia caseolaris, Avicennia officinalis along with mangrove associates comprising a large proportion of harvested mangrove forests. Similarly, tree, sapling and seedling densities, basal area, and biomass and carbon stocks were also found to vary across forest categories, with overall lower values observed in harvested areas. Lastly, total aboveground (11%) and belowground (18%) biomass and carbon stocks were also lower in harvested forests than non-harvested forests. However, large DBH size-class trees were found in harvested areas implying selective cutting practices that conserved old-growth trees and contributed to larger mean carbon pools. As harvesting is selective, mainly for cooking fuel demands, integrated management plans are required to accommodate local cultural and economic needs of the communities in this region.

TI  - Retiring environmental risks of marine renewable energy devices: The â€œhabitat changeâ€ case
AB  - The installation, presence, operation, and decommissioning of marine renewable energy (MRE) devices inevitably alters the surrounding ocean habitats. These changes may include direct effects on the benthos from the installation or removal of foundations and anchors, changes in community composition on and near devices, artificial reef effects, and indirect effects such as alteration of the food web or facilitation of non-native, invasive species dispersal. Although there is no expectation that MRE devices affect marine environments differently than other anthropogenic ocean uses, regulators and stakeholders continue to have questions about potential negative impacts to species and habitats from development. The objective here was to lay a path to advance toward risk retirement for potential habitat changes caused by MRE devices. Research studies and survey reports that inform our understanding of habitat changes were compiled into an evidence base, sorted into categories of effects, and evaluated by a group of international experts to assess potential risk to habitats and biota from small numbers of MRE devices, as well as to identify knowledge gaps. These gaps were organized by category and divided up by relevance to consenting, research, or project development and monitoring responsibilities. Identifying these â€œknown unknownsâ€ allows for study design and collaboration from various perspectives to fill the knowledge gaps. Distribution of the evidence base and remaining uncertainties and knowledge gaps to the MRE community, coupled with new research, will help advance the MRE industry while resolving concerns about the potential risks of habitat change for small numbers of devices.

TI  - Wave basin tests of innovative offshore fish farm concept
AB  - Wave basin tests have been performed on an innovative fish farm concept at scale 1:40. The concept consists of a refitted semi submersible equipped with four cages for a production of 15000 tons of salmon. In order to understand the hydrodynamic performance of the concept a generic semi submersible (70m x 70m) was developed and 4 cages representing a volume of approximately 73500 m3 (full scale) were constructed. The semi submersible and the cage were interconnected through a patented hinge system. Furthermore a scaled down net structure has been developed. In order to evaluate the performance of such a system MARIN has developed a two-step approach which requires towing tests of the net structure and wave basin tests of the full concept. Due to scaling laws hydrodynamic behavior of the net structure is examined separately through a towing test campaign. With the knowledge gained in the towing test campaign the results of the wave basin tests are interpreted more accurately and can be related to perceived loading and current velocity reduction due to the net structure. The results demonstrated that the interconnected cages have a strong influence on hydrostatic stability of the semi submersible. Significant stiffness is added to the system when cages are connected. The cages also provided significant damping in all degrees of freedom. In order to understand the behavior in current and waves several metocean conditions have been simulated at a water depth of 200m varying from benign waves of Hs 3m up to extreme conditions with sea states of Hs 11m with currents up to 1 m/s. The tests revealed favorable hydrodynamic behavior of the farm and provided valuable insights in loading mechanism at the hinge points and the current flow within the cages (which is a relevant parameter for the well-being of the fish). After the model test campaign a third phase is introduced in which a numerical model is tuned on basis of the model tests. The validated model will serve as a basis for design validation, detailed design and redesigns assessments. Â© 2019 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

TI  - Updated case study: The pursuit of an ultra-low manned platform pays dividends in the North Sea
AB  - The use of a unique, data-driven approach to remote condition monitoring of equipment maintenance has enabled a major offshore E&P producer to build and operate a a low-manned platform - a key step in its strategic goal to reduce per-barrel production costs to below $7. The field is 112 miles (180 km) off Norway's coast, with the platform drawing first oil in December 2016. In January 2019 - after operating identical offshore and onshore platform control rooms - the company started conducting remote condition monitoring of platform machinery exclusively from its control room onshore in Trondheim, Norway, 620 miles (1,000 km) away. With the remote equipment condition monitoring done onshore, the operator is better able to optimize maintenance work and schedules. At the same time, it has contributed to a big reduction in the number of offshore personnel otherwise required, reducing operating costs and personnel risks substantially. In May 2018, Siemens entered into a long-term partnership with the operator to continue developing digital solutions in a closed-loop lifecycle approach, utilizing the digital twin concept from pre-FEED and FEED stages through construction, commissioning, and operations, with operations expected to continue for a minimum of 20-years. This paper will provide an update to a 2018 OTC conference presentation when this use case was introduced. Last year's paper was based on operations and observations during 2017, the platform's first full year of operation. Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - LargeCO(2)release and tidal flushing in salt marsh crab burrows reduce the potential for blue carbon sequestration
AB  - Abundant crab burrows in carbon-rich, muddy salt marsh soils act as preferential water flow conduits, potentially enhancing carbon transport across the soil-water interface. With increasing recognition of blue carbon systems (salt marshes, mangroves, and seagrass) as hotspots of soil carbon sequestration, it is important to understand drivers of soil carbon cycling and fluxes. We conducted field observations and flow modeling to assess how crab burrows drive carbon exchange over time scales of minutes to weeks in an intertidal marsh in South Carolina. Results showed that continuous advective porewater exchange between the crab burrows and the surrounding soil matrix occurs because of tidally driven hydraulic gradients. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon in crab burrow porewater differ with that in the surrounding soil matrix, implying a diffusive C flux in the low-permeability marsh soil. Gas-phase concentrations of CO(2)in similar to 300 crab burrows were approximately six times greater than ambient air. The estimated total C export rate via porewater exchange (1.0 +/- 0.7 g C m(-2)d(-1)) was much greater than via passive diffusion transport (6.7 +/- 2 mg C m(-2)d(-1)) and gas-phase CO(2)release (1.8 mg C m(-2)d(-1)). The burrow-related carbon export was comparable to the regional salt marsh DIC export, groundwater-derived DIC export, and the net primary production previously estimated using ecosystem-scale approaches. These insights reveal how crab burrows modify blue carbon sequestration in salt marshes and contribute to coastal carbon budgets.

TI  - A Streamlined Product Development Process for Permanent Downhole Gauge: Key to High Operational Reliability in HPHT Wells
AB  - A permanent downhole gauge (PDG) in an intelligent completion provides real-time data concerning downhole conditions that can be used to assess the well environment and make informed decisions regarding reservoir and well integrity management. These gauges are permanently installed in severe downhole environments and rarely retrieved to surface for analysis or maintenance. Despite harsh conditions, the gauge is designed to achieve high operational reliability at temperatures of up to 200Â°C and pressures that reach 30,000 psi. The scope of this paper includes successful application of design for reliability (DfR) principles to streamline the product development process for high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) environments. Equipment and material reliability is critical to success in HP/HT environments. This paper discusses a reliability focused product development approach and highlights the application of DfR techniques used to qualify a downhole gauge for an operator's prelude floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) project offshore northwestern Australia. In this major well development project, downhole gauges are used for real-time permanent monitoring at high temperature downhole conditions. High operational reliability of a downhole gauge is important to ensure functionality throughout facility commissioning, startup, and operations after a well suspension period. Reliable recording of well integrity data during the well suspension period also helps improve operational simplicity. The DfR process is a systematic, streamlined, and concurrent engineering program designed to meet system reliability targets. This paper examines establishing a reliability specification for a downhole gauge, managing design risk using design failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) followed by design robustness testing using highly accelerated life tests, leading to a reliability demonstration test program to achieve target system reliability. This paper highlights an application of optimized DfR strategy along with an efficient reliability qualification test that resulted in successful product development. Improvements to the quality process to ensure reliability consistency between testing and the final commercial deployed gauges are also addressed in this paper. Additionally, this paper highlights strategic application of a powerful DfR process that aided design de-risking and helped attain system reliability targets, thereby, helping the operator meet its needs. Also demonstrated is how an efficient DfR process led to streamlined product development of a permanently installed downhole gauge resulting in cost and time-to-market improvements while establishing reliability.

TI  - Experimental study on methane hydrate formation in quartz sand under tri-axial condition
AB  - Methane hydrate (MH) has been considered as one of the cleanest energy resources. Its huge resource reserve and high energy density have attracted widespread attention in the scientific field. The dynamic behavior of MH formation and the resulting hydrate saturation are greatly influenced by the conditions of the formation process, such as water-gas ratio (WGR), pressure (P), temperature (T), and the mass fraction of NaCl (X-NaCl). To gain a better understanding of the kinetic behavior of the in-situ MH deposits, a novel trTaxial horizon fixed bed reactor was set up to synthesize MH samples under typical marine conditions. A series of MH formation experiments were conducted under similar initial stress conditions (initial trTaxial stress of 16.50 MPa to simulate the overburden stress of marine MH) while perturbing the other key factors (WGR, P, T, and X-NaCl) to investigate their effects. The results show that MH saturation attained at the end of formation from an initial water-gas mixing condition was negatively affected by initial WGR, T, and the existence of NaCl. MH formation in the fixed bed reactor increases initial X-NaCl = 3.0 wt\% to a maximum of X-NaCl = 5.29 wt\% and shifts the MH equilibrium curve to a more stringent condition for MH formation. Higher pressure promotes CH4 conversion to MH and increases MH saturation from the start of gas injection to the time when the pressure of the reactor was stable (Delta P < 20 kPa/h). Larger initial WGRs (above MH hydration number = 5.75) and higher pressures result in a reduction of the induction time. Increasing temperature and the presence of NaCl increase the induction time.

TI  - Energy metabolism and regeneration are impaired by seawater acidification in the infaunal brittlestar Amphiura filiformis
AB  - Seawater acidification due to anthropogenic release of CO2 as well as the potential leakage of pure CO2 from sub-seabed carbon capture storage (CCS) sites may impose a serious threat to marine organisms. Although infaunal organisms can be expected to be particularly impacted by decreases in seawater pH, as a result of naturally acidified conditions in benthic habitats, information regarding physiological and behavioral responses is still scarce. Determination of P-O2 and P-CO2 gradients within burrows of the brittlestar Amphiura filiformis during environmental hypercapnia demonstrated that besides hypoxic conditions, increases of environmental P-CO2 are additive to the already high P-CO2 (up to 0.08 kPa) within the burrows. In response to up to 4 weeks exposure to pH 7.3 (0.3 kPa P-CO2) and pH 7.0 (0.6 kPa P-CO2), metabolic rates of A. filiformis were significantly reduced in pH 7.0 treatments, accompanied by increased ammonium excretion rates. Gene expression analyses demonstrated significant reductions of acid-base (NBCe and AQP9) and metabolic (G6PDH, LDH) genes. Determination of extracellular acid-base status indicated an uncompensated acidosis in CO2-treated animals, which could explain the depressed metabolic rates. Metabolic depression is associated with a retraction of filter feeding arms into sediment burrows. Regeneration of lost arm tissues following traumatic amputation is associated with significant increases in metabolic rate, and hypercapnic conditions (pH 7.0, 0.6 kPa) dramatically reduce the metabolic scope for regeneration, reflected in an 80\% reduction in regeneration rate. Thus, the present work demonstrates that elevated seawater P-CO2 significantly affects the environment and the physiology of infaunal organisms like A. filiformis.

TI  - Global patterns of aboveground carbon stock and sequestration in mangroves
AB  - In order to contribute to understand the factors that control the provisioning of the ecosystem service of carbon storage by mangroves, data on carbon stock and sequestration in the aboveground biomass (AGB) from 73 articles were averaged and tested for the dependence on latitude, climatic parameters, physiographic types and age. Global means of carbon stock (78.0 +/- 64.5 tC. ha(-1)) and sequestration (2.9 +/- 2.2 tC. ha(-1). yr(-1)) showed that mangroves are among the forest ecosystems with greater capacity of carbon storage in AGB per area. On the global scale, carbon stock increases toward the equator (R-2 = 0.22) and is dependent on 13 climatic parameters, which can be integrated in the following predictive equation: Carbon Stock in AGB = -16.342 + (8.341 x Isothermality) + (0.021 x Annual Precipitation) {[}R-2 = 0.34; p < 0.05]. It was shown that almost 70\% of carbon stock variability is explained by age. Carbon stock and sequestration also vary according to physiographic types, indicating the importance of hydroperiod and edaphic parameters to the local variability of carbon stock. By demonstrating the contribution of local and regional-global factors to carbon stock, this study provides information to the forecast of the effects of future climate changes and local anthropogenic forcings on this ecosystem service.

TI  - Safer Operations in Changing Ice-Covered Seas: Approaches and Perspectives
AB  - The last decades witnessed an increase in Arctic offshore operations, partly driven by rising energy needs and partly due to easing of sea ice conditions and improved accessibility of shipping routes. The study examines changes in sea ice and ocean conditions in the Arctic with their implications for off-shore safety. The objective of the research is to develop a basis for forecasting technologies for maritime operations. We assess loads on off-shore structures from sea ice and ocean in centennial climate future projections and implications for the accessibility and future Arctic shipping. As a test case, we calculate loads on a tubular structure of 100-m wide and 20-m tall, similar to installations in the Beaufort Sea in the 1980s. With sea ice retreating, loads are predicted to increase from ~0.1 Ã— 106Â N (MN) at present to ~50â€“200 MN in the 2090s, primarily due to wave loads. This study asserts the need for new approaches in forecasting to make marine operations in the Arctic safer. Â© 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Antifouling with Chloride Ion Electrolytic Recycling through a Momentum Boundary Layer
AB  - SeaLite Engineering, after a 10-yr research and development program, has produced an operational antifouling system for ocean sensors and instruments designed for low power consumption and long (> 1 yr) deployments. The important innovation is the replacement of pumps by gravity and external motion to significantly reduce energy consumption. Also, a prototype system for autonomous underwater vehicle control surfaces is now undergoing laboratory testing. The effectiveness of SeaLite's technology has been demonstrated year-round in northern estuaries and in the Gulf of Mexico, the latter by an independent agency. The process leading to this result was, first starting in 2010, an extensive laboratory evaluation of electrode alloys, calibration of chlorine production versus electric power input, and the location for attaching electrodes to various objects requiring protection from fouling. After 2015 the experimentation moved to the ocean, first in a Cape Cod estuary and then to the Gulf of Mexico. Comparisons with a mechanical antifouling system were done in situ, and with a UV antifouling system from AML Oceanographic, Ltd., by comparing the data. Starting in 2019, the development of biofilms, from their initial deposition through the extra polysaccharide substance stage, were experimentally investigated by taking samples from an estuary near SeaLite's laboratory. Biofilms on microscope slides and water column samples were collected. This was done in different seasons, from spring bloom, summer doldrums, autumn temperature decline, and the winter freeze. The objective was to determine the level of biofilm growth that would require antifouling, and its' seasonal, temperature, and solar radiation dependence, and thus to conserve power.

TI  - Coastal Evaluation and Planning for Development of Subsurface Intake Systems
AB  - The feasibility of using a subsurface intake system for a seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) water treatment plant is based on the site-specific hydrogeologic conditions which control the type of intake design that can be used and the capacity of the intake. Planning for future development of subsurface intake systems requires a careful analysis of the shoreline and shallow offshore area. Example regions, the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia and the shoreline of Florida (USA), were investigated to develop general feasibility criteria for possible development of SWRO intake systems. Within the Red Sea, it was found that various well intake systems could be feasible for low-capacity SWRO facilities and high capacity intake systems would be limited to seabed gallery intakes. Coastal Florida had more subsurface intake options available, including wells, beach galleries, and seabed galleries which could be used based on the required capacity and the specific site conditions. The presence of high transmissivity carbonate aquifers containing seawater in Florida would allow medium capacity SWRO systems to use conventional vertical wells. High capacity systems could be developed using beach gallery systems in many locations. The methods developed for shoreline and nearshore evaluation contained herein could be applied to any coastal region of the world for subsurface intake evaluation.

TI  - Old before your time: Ancient carbon incorporation in contemporary aquatic foodwebs
AB  - The current paradigm in trophic dynamic theory is that organisms will gain more energy from fresh, young organic materials because they contain the essential elements and chemical characteristics for enhancing growth, unlike more aged and thus conceptually degraded resources. However, a growing body of recent literature is raising exceptions to this resource-age paradigm and highlights that organisms present in diverse aquatic settings in fact incorporate old organic carbon into their biomass. This shift in resource utilization has the potential to alter foodweb stability, structure, and dynamics, but has yet to be integrated into ecological studies and conceptual frameworks. In this review, we first outline a number of recent studies providing direct evidence of the transport and incorporation of old organic carbon in aquatic food webs, and then discuss the ecological implications of this changing view in resource utilization. We ultimately highlight future research avenues that will provide new insights into the response of aquatic foodwebs to the increased mobilization and delivery of old organic carbon to aquatic settings following anthropogenic perturbations and ongoing climatic change.

TI  - Multiscale hybrid CNT and CF reinforced PEEK composites with enhanced EMI properties
AB  - Due to ever increasing use of telecommunication and electronic devices in offshore and stealth technology sectors, developing highly-efficient electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with good thermal resistance are urgently required. In this paper, the effect of MWCNTs incorporation on the mechanical, interlaminar bonding and EMI performance of MWCNT/CF/PEEK composites were firstly studied. The introduction of interlaminar MWCNTs did not affect the tensile strength and modulus significantly at low loadings whilst slight decrease in them was seen beyond a MWCNT content of 2.5 g/m2 due to the presence of CNT clusters. Improvement in the flexural strength and modulus as well as interlaminar bonding were achieved, reaching the peak values at an interlaminar MWCNT content of 1.5 g/m2. This is because the existence of inter-ply CNTs improves the stiffness and strength of the interlaminar region in shear when the material is subjected to bending moment. EMI shielding effectiveness of the laminates was markedly enhanced by 76% at an interlaminar CNT content as low as 2.5 g/m2 (equivalent to 0.53 wt.%). For the first time, this work has demonstrated the effectiveness and high efficiency of utilizing a multilayer structural design with the CNTs spray coated at the interlaminar region to improve the EMI shielding performance of CF/PEEK composites.

TI  - Life cycle assessment of hydrogen supply chain with special attention on hydrogen refuelling stations
AB  - The controversial and highly emotional discussion about biofuels in recent years has shown that greenhouse gas(2) (GHG) emissions can only be evaluated in an acceptable way by carrying out a full life cycle assessment (LCA) taking the overall life cycle including all necessary pre-chains into consideration. Against this background, the goal of this paper is it to analyse the overall life cycle of a hydrogen production and provision. A state of the art hydrogen refuelling station in Hamburg/Germany opened in February 2012 is therefore taken into consideration. Here at least 50\% hydrogen from renewable sources of energy is produced on-site by water electrolysis based on surplus electricity from wind (mainly offshore wind parks) and water. The remaining other 50\% of hydrogen to be sold by this station mainly to hydrogen-fuelled buses is provided by trucks from a large-scale production plant where hydrogen is produced from methane or glycerol as a by-product of the biodiesel production. These two pathways are compared within the following explanations with hydrogen production from biomass and from coal. The results show that - with the goal of reducing GHG emissions on a life cycle perspective - hydrogen production based on a water electrolysis fed by electricity from the German electricity mix should be avoided. Steam methane reforming is more promising in terms of GHG reduction but it is still based on a finite fossil fuel. For a climatic sound provision of hydrogen as a fuel electricity from renewable sources of energy like wind or biomass should be used. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

TI  - Ultra: Flow assurance coating technology - Product portfolio for distinct operating scenarios
AB  - ULTRAâ„¢ is a novel and advanced flow assurance coating technology recently introduced in the Brazilian market for upcoming, and challenging, offshore projects expected in the next years. This coating technology has been used for over 9 years, and has been designed, applied and installed in offshore projects worldwide. Particularly over the last year, this thermal insulation system has been applied for a major project in Brazil. It is a thermal insulation system composed of fusion bonded epoxy and styrenic materials. A base 3-layer coating, followed by one or more insulation layers of solid or foamed styrene, and a high ductility outer shield were engineered to outperform some of existing solutions in terms of hydrostatic pressure, subsea stability, overall insulation thickness and associated installation costs. Application trials have been successfully performed to validate plant capabilities for applying the wide range of styrene-based system solutions, for shallow and deep waters. Test results demonstrated that foam and solid versions have a sweet spot in which the system outperforms similar to the wet insulation solutions existing in the Brazilian market. Its solid and foam systems demonstrated capability of delivering lower U - values (Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient) due to their lower thermal conductivity. The benefit of lower thermal conductivity is reflected in a reduced coating thickness and opportunities for potential savings during the transportation and installation activities. In the coming years, the offshore industry in Brazil will demand wet insulation systems delivering improved thermal performance. Hence, lower U value with lower CAPEX and in deeper water depths. This insulation system is a proven flow assurance coating technology, addressing those challenges and now available in the Brazilian market. Â© Copyright 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Roadmap to sustainable carbon-neutral energy and environment: can we cross the barrier of biomass productivity?
AB  - The total number of inhabitants on the Earth is estimated to cross a record number of 9 x 10(3) million by 2050 that present a unique challenge to provide energy and clean environment to every individual. The growth in population results in a change of land use, and greenhouse gas emission due to increased industrialization and transportation. Energy consumption affects the quality of the environment by adding carbon dioxide and other pollutants to the atmosphere. This leads to oceanic acidification and other environmental fluctuations due to global climate change. Concurrently, speedy utilization of known conventional fuel reservoirs causes a challenge to a sustainable supply of energy. Therefore, an alternate energy resource is required that can maintain the sustainability of energy and environment. Among different alternatives, energy production from high carbon dioxide capturing photosynthetic aquatic microbes is an emerging technology to clean environment and produce carbon-neutral energy from their hydrocarbon-rich biomass. However, economical challenges due to low biomass production still prevent the commercialization of bioenergy. In this work, we review the impact of fossil fuels burning, which is predominantly used to fulfill global energy demand, on the quality of the environment. We also assess the status of biofuel production and utilization and discuss its potential to clean the environment. The complications associated with biofuel manufacturing using photosynthetic microorganisms are discussed and directed evolution for targeted phenotypes and targeted delivery of nutrients are proposed as potential strategies to increase the biomass production.

TI  - Progression through technology: Results of acid systems application to improve injectivity of horizontal wells in caspian offshore oilfield
AB  - Yuri Korchagin field, located in the Russian sector of the Caspian Sea, is one of the largest field on the Caspian shelf with proven reserves stand at 29 million tons of oil and 63 billion cubic meters of gas. Since the beginning of commercial operation, in the spring 2010, the field production passed eight million tons of oil. The operator company conducts development of Yu. Korchagin field by a system of horizontal wells with a length up to 8000 m, from a fixed offshore ice-resistant platform, installed in the dome area of the structure. The main challenges in the field development are associated with premature water and gas breakthroughs at high permeability intervals of horizontal wells. Currently, as a result of the sharp increase in the field water cut, the oil production is constrained due to the existing limitations on volume of produced water that can be utilized in the conditions of the offshore field. Two water-injection wells were drilled and commissioned to utilize produced formation water into the aquiferous zone of the carbonate reservoir. In order to restore and increase the injectivity factor, small-volume acid treatments are carried out yearly on the carbonate reservoirs in the lower horizontal sections of the water-injection wells. Since 2014, more than 20 matrix and hydrochloric acid treatments were performed with application of acid systems of different compositions and volumes. In some cases, the wells injectivity increase after matrix acidizing treatments with traditional acid systems was below expectation, demonstrating limited and short-term effect. Therefore, with constantly increasing volume of produced water at the field, it was required to increase the frequency of acid treatments to maintain the appropriate level of injectivity of the water-injection wells. The additional treatments are associated with significant time and financial costs because of the offshore platform standby and production suspension. The need exists to improve efficiency of acid stimulation treatments performed in the field to achieve sustainable increase in injectivity index of existing wells. The purpose of this study is to analyze acid stimulation treatments carried out on carbonate reservoirs of the horizontal water-injection wells in 2014-2017, evaluate the efficiency of the treatments with different acid systems to change the injectivity factor, discuss the prospects for their application in Yu. Korchagin field and formulate recommendations for further efficiency improvements of acid stimulation treatments in the field. Â© Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers

TI  - Typhoon energy utilization using mega-yacht system
AB  - Typhoon, hurricane or tropical cyclone are characterized by the release of large amounts of latent heat of condensation. Even if an average typhoon has 1018J energy which is enough for annual Japanese electric power. Therefore until now, none of human beings can utilize this huge ocean energy. If we could develop a system that drawn out power from the typhoon or as such high wind energy resources, we could obtain clean and abundant energy. In this research proposes the concept of a sailing type power plant, designed as a mega sailing yacht with some underwater power generators. This power plant operates under the high wind energy area with its hard sails and the underwater propeller generators yield electric power, which will be stored by batteries or H 2 conversion. Our feasibility study shows that using the 1000 mega yacht fleet, the annual power in Japan can be easily obtained with no CO 2 emission. In this paper discuss our concept with the mega-float wind power concept and the results of model test in the tank. Copyright Â© 2010 by ASME.

TI  - A new design of equilibrator to monitor carbon dioxide in highly dynamic and turbid environments
AB  - A new design of equilibrator for carbon dioxide monitoring in natural waters is described. It consists in a vertical tube filled with marbles through which water is flowing while equilibrating with a closed air circuit. It offers several advantages compared with classical equilibrators, among which is a fast response time (half-life constant approximate to 30 s) and the potential to work in very turbid water. The proposed equilibrator is of particular interest to monitor carbon dioxide in coastal ecosystems, such as estuaries, which are known to be turbid and highly dynamic. Two performance tests and some field results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed system. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Asset Management Strategy for a Coastal Revetment Exposed to Increased Wave Forcing: Grays Harbor, Washington, U.S.A
AB  - The Grays Harbor federal navigation project is on the southwest coast in Washington State, U.S.A. Recently, increased wave energy associated with the morphology of the harbor inlet throat has resulted in significant damages to the Point Chehalis revetment. Nearshore wave heights at the revetment have increased to the point where wave overtopping occurs routinely during a typical storm season (late October to late March). The high frequency of overtopping has resulted in progressive damage and subsidence of the structure over the past decade resulting in emergency repairs in 2010. This paper presents risk management tools utilized to help predict where future damages would occur as a result of the evolving nearshore wave conditions as well as a rehabilitation plan to mitigate future damages over the structures life cycle.

TI  - A comparison of Riley encased methodology and traditional techniques for planting red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle)
AB  - The effectiveness of encasement and traditional techniques for planting red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle) in moderate to high wave energy environments was assessed. The three encasement types were the half-length PVC pipes, full-length PVC pipes, and bamboo pipes. Plantings were conducted in August, 1997 at two locations in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida: Sebastian and Rocky Point. Furthermore, plantings were conducted in November, 1997 using full-length encasements and conventional planting. Results indicate that seedlings planted within full-length PVC encasements had the highest survivorship and growth because of their protection from waves and currents. Failure of seedlings within bamboo encasements seemed to be caused by insufficient light exposure. When comparing the two locations, a significantly greater growth was observed at the Sebastian location than at the Rocky Point location for the planting conducted in November, but not for those planted in August. No significant difference was observed in seedling survival when comparing those planted in August and November. However, there was significantly greater growth in mangroves planted in August. With the exception of width of surf zone, there was no significant difference in the selected environmental parameters between the two locations.

TI  - Mechanical and electrical performance analysis of high power subsea transmission cable
AB  - Some of the increasing demand for electricity is expected to be met offshore either by using renewable sources or by exploiting hydrocarbon reserves in stranded gas fields. This paper presents results from an investigation into transmission cable analysis for a floating offshore power station. Mechanical stresses experienced by high power cable in dynamic application are assessed with a view to determining fatigue life. In addition, large scale offshore power generation requires the development of new technologies for low-loss subsea electrical transmission systems. In order to investigate thoroughly the system electrical characteristics during the transmission process, there is a need for comprehensive analysis of its harmonic performance. The harmonic analysis of subsea power cable electrical performance can be demonstrated by mathematical models, the results of which are presented in this paper.

TI  - Carbon accumulation and vertical accretion in a restored versus historic salt marsh in southern Puget Sound, Washington, United States
AB  - Few comparisons exist between vertical accretion (VA) and carbon accumulation rates (CARs) in restored versus historic (i.e. reference) marshes. Here, we compare these processes in a formerly diked, sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh (Six Gill Slough, SG), whose surface is subsided relative to the tidal frame, to an adjacent, relatively pristine, historic salt marsh (Animal Slough, AS). Six sediment cores were collected at both AS and SG approximately 6 years after restoration. Cores were analyzed for bulk density (BD), \% loss of ignition, \% organic carbon, and Pb-210. We found that sharp changes in BD in surface layers of SG cores were highly reliable markers for the onset of restoration. The mean VA since restoration at SG (0.79 {[}SD = 0.29] cm/year) was approximately twice that of AS (0.41 {[}SD = 0.16] cm/year). In comparison, the VA at AS over 50 years was 0.30 (SD = 0.09) cm/year. VA consisted almost entirely of inorganic sediment at SG whereas at AS it was approximately 55\%. Mean CARs at SG were somewhat greater than at AS, but the difference was not significant due to high variability (SG: 81-210 g C m(-2) year(-1); AS: 115-168 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The mean CAR at AS over the past 50 years was 118 (SD = 23) g C m(-2) year(-1). This study demonstrates that a sparsely vegetated, restored salt marsh can quickly begin to accumulate carbon and that historic and restored marshes can have similar CARs despite highly divergent formation processes.

TI  - Hybrid EOR technology: Carbonated water and smart water improved recovery in oil wet carbonate formation
AB  - Search for an alternative, cheap and environmental friendly EOR method has resulted in the development and subsequent field implementation of Smart Water Injection (SWI) and CO2 injection (COI). Though miscible COI has multi-fold advantages, carbonated water injection (CWI) may surpass COI in terms of volume requirement and efficiency. This research work is focused on finding the benefits of combination of SWI &amp; CWI in terms of reduced residual saturations in oil wet carbonate formation. In order to measure the recovery efficiency, core flooding experiments are conducted with SWI as a tertiary recovery following sea water secondary recovery. This is followed by quaternary recovery using smart water saturated with CO2 (CSWI). Three high potential smart water compositions are screened and the best one is chosen for oil recovery studies. Effluent samples collected at pre-defined pore volume injection intervals are analyzed in ppm level using ICP-MS. The analysis is supported by NMR porosity distribution studies, interfacial tension and zeta-potential studies. Core flooding results showed that tertiary recovery with SWI resulted in 4.8 - 9.5% recovery, whereas the quaternary recovery with CSWI resulted in 5.7 % to 13.6% additional oil. The underlying physical processes and the pore-scale mechanisms of fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interactions during SWI-CWI are explained in terms of surface potential, electrical double layer, oil swelling factor, droplet coalescence, wettability alteration and flow diversion due to fluid redistribution within the pore network. From this study it is established that CSWI could be a novel and promising EOR technique among the latest EOR methods. CSWI has an advantage over COI due to the fact that it exists as a dissolved gas instead of free phase. It eliminates the requirement for high pressure system, the problems of gravity segregation and poor sweep efficiency. Combination of CWI with SWI can make it an effective EOR solution with significant cost advantage, higher oil recovery in addition to the environmental benefits of CO2 sequestration.

TI  - Short-term variability of carbon chemistry in two contrasting seagrass meadows at Dongsha Island: Implications for pH buffering and CO2 sequestration
AB  - The diurnal cycles of carbon chemistry parameters, i.e., dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), and pH, were investigated in two hydrodynamically contrasting seagrass meadows at Dongsha Island in the northern South China Sea in August 2015. The results show that the pH and TA were higher and that the pCO(2) was lower in the semi-enclosed inner lagoon (IL) than on the open north shore (NS). The analyses of carbon chemistry parameters vs. dissolved oxygen and TA vs. DIC relationships reveal that the CO2 dynamics was dominated by photosynthesis/respiration (P/R) alone on the NS but by the combined effect of P/R and sedimentary anaerobic pathways in the IL. We suggest that the observed divergent behaviors in carbon chemistry between the two sites could be attributed to differences in hydrodynamic regimes. The less energetic hydrodynamics and longer residence time in the IL would be favorable for the occurrence of sedimentary anaerobic TA generation and the subsequent TA accumulation in the overlying waters. The elevated TA may lead to a pH increase and a pCO(2) decrease, thus providing a buffering effect against ocean acidification (OA) and enhancing atmospheric CO2 sequestration at local scales. The present results demonstrate that hydrodynamic regime may play an important role in regulating biogeochemical processes in seagrass meadows, and thereby modulating their capacities in OA buffering and CO2 uptaking.

TI  - News industry: Cooperation in European CCS sector
AB  - Norwegian and French researchers have agreed to cooperate more closely on developing solutions for the capture and storage of CO2 following a seminar held in Oslo, Norway, in November 2007. A number of carbon capture and storage (CCS) project proposals were defined, all with the same goal-achieving a significant and urgent reduction in climate gas emissions. Norway's goal is to reduce such emissions by 30% by 2020, while France, like the rest of the EU, is aiming for a 20% reduction by 2020. By 2050, Norway intends to be climate neutral, while France aims to reduce its emissions to a quarter of its current level. Several research works are currently being carried out in both Norway and France, ranging from basic research to full-scale demonstration projects ? and more CCS projects are in the pipeline. A test facility for CO2 capture technologies will be built at the Mongstad gas power plant in western Norway and be in operation in 2010, to which Alstom will provide a capture plant. Gaz de France has experience from the K12-B CO2 injection project in the North Sea, while Total has been running a CCS program since 2001 and, in 2008, plans to start pumping CO2 into an empty gas reservoir in Lacq in southwest France.

TI  - Impact of Large-Scale Wind and Solar Power Integration on Operating Reserve Requirements of an Islanded Power System
AB  - Many nations have shown their support to a battle against environmental pollution by integrating large scale solar and wind energy resources, to their respective grids. Although these commendable efforts have paved the way for a greener future, it has to he noted that non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE) possess their own inherent drawbacks. Their availability is highly dependent on the prevalent weather conditions, which means that they are subjected to uncontrollable variability. With the rise of intermittent renewable resources, it is important to have appropriate amounts of operating reserves to provide backup to the system. This will ensure that the system will be stable under variable power conditions and thus, improve the reliability of the system. This paper is focused in quantifying additional operating reserves requirements to stabilize the system under intermittent conditions with the large penetration of renewables into an islanded power system. It assesses the spinning reserve requirement during the high wind and low wind seasons.

TI  - Partial recovery of infaunal communities during a fallow period at an open-ocean aquaculture
AB  - Open-ocean or offshore aquaculture has attracted recent controversy for its potential environmental impacts and proposed expansion in the USA. Organic enrichment of benthic marine communities has been documented extensively under nearshore fish farms-primarily from fish feces and feed pellets-but relatively few studies have examined the effects of deeper, offshore operations. In this study, we investigate the effects of a 6 mo non-operational fallow period on benthic invertebrate communities surrounding a commercial offshore fish farm. Polychaete species diversity and community structure were analyzed at distant reference sites and farm-adjacent affected sites before, during and after the fallow period. The relative abundances of 3 polychaete indicator species for organic enrichment were also analyzed. During the fallow period, community structure at affected sites became more similar to communities at distant reference sites. Additionally, the sudden disappearance of enrichment indicator species at previously affected sites during the fallow period further suggests the beginnings of a recovery. However, species diversity did not increase significantly during the fallow period, indicating that the affected communities had not been fully restored to pre-culture or distant reference conditions, This study demonstrates the potential environmental benefits of scheduled fallow periods or crop rotations in offshore aquaculture.

TI  - Subsea infrastructure inspection: A review study
AB  - Due to the increasing energy demands, the offshore energy business has boomed in recent decades. Sub-sea pipeline and power transmission cable installations are commonly applied worldwide. Any potential breakages can cause equipment damage and also damage the environment. The majority of the offshore pipeline inspections are currently committed using Towed or Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) systems. It is well-known that the ROVs are very time-consuming and expensive to operate, with respect to the fact that they require a relatively large support ship to accommodate the equipment as well as very skilled pilot and crews. The paper examines the existing challenges related to the subsea inspection in general, the ROVs, AUVs and semi-autonomous ROVs advantages and disadvantages in different subsea inspection applications. Replacing the ROVs with Semi or fully-Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (S-AUVs) can significantly change the inspections of infrastructure, as these vehicles could be much cheaper to deploy. S-AUVs can potentially conduct faster data collection and provide higher inspection data quality. However, there are still some technical challenges related to: Underwater wireless communication; battery and propulsion capacity; independent/supported navigation and localization; refueling and recharging, including underwater docking station feasibility; as well as the coordination and communication of a group of vehicles. In general, the offshore industry is conservative in the adoption of highly autonomous (not directly supervised) systems in general, and this seems to also be the case for S-AUV technology, in part due to regulatory requirements and certifications. This study concludes that semi-autonomous upgrades to existing ROV technology is a realistic first step towards the adaption of AUVs for the task of sub-sea infrastructure inspection. This opens the possibility to increase the capabilities of these existing solution the semi-autonomous way without a large increase in construction cost and without fully moving to an tether-less AUV solution.

TI  - Assessment of ship's emissions using recovery systems
AB  - In the shipping Industry, fuel consumption is becoming a critical issue with the increase in fuel prices and the pressure to reduce overall carbon emissions. Reduction in fuel consumption could be achieved by either recovering the heat from the engine exhaust or by using green technology to assist propulsion using direct wind power. The work presented is a comparative assessment of the three main types of ships, namely oil tankers, container carrier ships and LNG Carriers. Results of the study illustrate that, the CO 2 emission from a 3,60,000 m3 cargo capacity oil tanker using 10% heat recovery can achieve 11.07 % Energy Efficiency on the Design Index improvement and reduction of 16,358 tones of CO 2 emission per year. Using 32ton capacity Sail-kite (sky sail) can achieve 10.6 % EEDI improvement and 15,664 tons of CO 2 emission reduction per year. It is believed that the savings result from these add-on systems are both economical and attractive and will hopefully stimulate the shipping industry into selecting such solutions well into the foreseeable future.

TI  - Organic carbon isotope and pollen evidence for mangrove development and response to human activity in Guangxi (Southwest China) over the last 140 years
AB  - Mangrove degradation must reduce carbon sequestration in recent years, thereby aggravating global warming. Thus, short-term impacts of human activity on mangrove ecosystems are cause for concern from local governments and scientists. Mangroves sediments can provide detailed records of mangrove species variation in the last one hundred years, based on detailed 210Pb data. The study traced the history of mangrove development and its response to environmental change over the last 140 years in two mangrove swamps of Guangxi, Southwest China. Average sedimentation rates were calculated to be 0.48 cm/a and 0.56 cm/a in the Yingluo Bay and the Maowei Sea, respectively. Chemical indicators (delta 13C(org) and C:N) were utilized to trace the contribution of mangrove-derived organic matter (MOM) using a ternary mixing model. Simultaneous use of mangrove pollen can help to supplement some of these limitations in diagenetic/overlap of isotopic signatures. We found that vertical distribution of MOM was consistent with mangrove pollen, which could provide similar information for tracing mangrove ecosystems. Therefore, mangrove development was reconstructed and divided into three stages: flourishing, degradation and re-flourishing/re-degradation period. The significant degradation, found in the period of 1968-1998 and 1907-2007 in the Yingluo Bay and the Maowei Sea, respectively, corresponding to a rapid increase of reclamation area and seawall length, rather than climate change as recorded in the region.

TI  - A pre-feasibility study for electrification in Nijhum Dwip using hybrid renewable technology
AB  - Electricity being an integral part of modern age technology, is an imperative element for sustainable development. Using fossil fuel for the generation of electricity has been the norm but alarming reasons such as depletion of fossil fuel at an increased pace and their tremendous negative impact on environment have led to growing interest in using renewable resources for generating electricity which can ensure the fulfilment of energy demand both for us and our posterity. This paper has done a pre-feasibility study on a hybrid renewable power system in Nijhum Dwip of Bangladesh which is a detached island from national grid system. The prospect of Solar, Wind and Biomass as renewable components of a hybrid system has been explored with the inclusion of a diesel generator to compare the renewable vs. conventional system both economically and environmentally. Using HOMER the most efficient system was found to have an electricity generation cost of almost BDT 20/kWh for an average load of 5.5 MWh/day with a 950 kW peak. An assessment visit to the island contributed towards load calculation. An emission reduction of almost 3422 ton CO2 by replacing an equivalent diesel based plant with the optimized system is possible to be accomplished.

TI  - Preliminary design and performance assessment of an underwater compressed air energy storage system for wind power balancing
AB  - A key approach to large renewable power management is based on implementing storage technologies, including batteries, power-to-gas, and compressed air energy storage (CAES). This work presents the preliminary design and performance assessment of an innovative type of CAES, based on underwater compressed air energy storage (UW-CAES) volumes and intended for installation in the proximity of deep-water seas or lakes. The UW-CAES works with constant hydrostatic pressure storage and variable volumes. The proposed system is adiabatic, not using any fuel to increase the air temperature before expansion; a sufficient turbine inlet temperature (TIT) is instead obtained through a thermal energy storage (TES) system which recovers the compression heat. The system includes (i) a set of turbomachines (modular multistage compressor, with partial intercooling; expansion turbine); (ii) a TES system with different temperature levels designed to recover a large fraction of the compression heat, allowing the subsequent heating of air prior to the expansion phase; (iii) an underwater modular compressed air storage, conceived as a network of rigid but open tanks lying on the seabed and allowing a variable-volume and constant pressure operation. The compressor operates at variable loads, following an oscillating renewable power input, according to strategies oriented to improve the overall system dispatchability; the expander can be designed to work either at full load, thanks to the stability of the air flowrate and of the TIT guaranteed by the thermal storage, or at variable load. This paper first discusses in detail the sizing and off-design characterization of the overall system; then it simulates a case study where the UW-CAES is coupled to a wind farm for peak shaving and dispatchability enhancement, evaluating the impact of a realistic power input on performances and plant flexibility. Although the assessment shall be considered preliminary, it is shown that round-trip efficiency (RTE) in the range of 75-80% can be obtained depending on the compressor section configuration, making the UW-CAES a promising technology compared to electrochemical and pumped-hydrostorage systems. The technology is also applied to perform peak-shaving of the electricity production from an off-shore wind farm; annual simulations, based on realistic wind data and considering part-load operation, result in global RTE around 75% with a 10-15% reduction in the average unplanned energy injection in the electric grid. The investigated case study provides an example of the potential of this system in providing power output peak shaving when coupled with an intermittent and nonpredictable energy source.

AB  - The main wastes associated with well drilling activity are drilling fluids and cuttings. With regard to drilling fluids, the oil industry has invested in more environmentally friendly formulations to reduce environmental impact. For offshore operations, cuttings are generally disposal at sea after meeting environmental criteria of government agencies. This paper presents the lessons learned in the operation of the cuttings collector system and the collection of cuttings associated with water based mud in cutting boxes in Campos Basin wells. The main advances to reduce the non-productive time of the cuttings collector system were the use of hybrid boats and the increase of the screw conveyor reliability. To collect cuttings associated with water-based mud, the drilling fluid + cuttings mixture needs to be treated to prevent H2S generation. Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

There are two broad service categories for maritime, Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) and Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT). MSS is offered by the likes of Inmarsat and Iridium, and offer volume-based charging. VSAT requires the installation of more permanent equipment. Offshore oil and gas rigs can sometimes take advantage of microwave links to connect them to the shore, obviating the need to use satellite network services. Some companies are also building pioneering ship-to-shore Wi-Fi communications. Constant cargo monitoring requires the use of sensors placed on containers. The sensors register the location of the container, along with other environmental variables, and they then communicate the data to the receivers.

TI  - Optimizing capacity extensions in power systems: a case study of Bavaria and a comparison to Texas
AB  - As the German Energiewende policy enters the latter stages of its goal to dismantle the country's nuclear power plant fleet, the southern state of Bavaria must decide how it will replace its nuclear generation capacity. This study extends a renewable capacity expansion model that was initially developed to find optimal extensions of wind and solar generation and transmission for Texas, United States. Here, additional options for the development of the Bavarian electricity supply are added: combined-heat-and-power (CHP), improving transmission connections to the non-Bavarian German generator fleet, and constructing new natural gas combined cycle (CCGT) power plants within Bavaria. The model's solution suggests that an optimal mix includes 3.5 GW of transmission to the non-Bavarian generator fleet, 6.0 to 9.5 GW of new CCGT capacity, and 8.5 to 10.0 GW of transmission capacity to the on-shore wind resources of the Schleswig-Holstein state in northern Germany, depending on the CO2 price. Compared to the model results for Texas, Bavaria's system is less sensitive to a CO2 price in both the optimal system configuration and the resulting emissions. While Texas emissions can be reduced by 55\% with a CO2 price increase from 10 to 100 \$/ton, the reduction in Bavaria is only 28\% with a price increase from 0 to 100 EUR/ton.

TI  - Dynamics of wetlands and their effects on carbon emissions in China coastal region - Case study in Bohai Economic Rim
AB  - Wetlands are one of the largest carbon sinks in the world due to their large carbon storage, potential for carbon sequestration in peat formation, sediment deposition and plant biomass. However, rapid economic development is causing changes to wetland carbon storage. China has participated in the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and is decreasing its carbon emissions. Analyzing the carbon changes that are caused by wetland dynamics may provide some insights regarding decreasing carbon emissions. Therefore, wetland data from 1985, 1995 and 2005 were extracted from remote sensing images. Using spatial analysis and statistics, we determined that the water body area continued to increase, whereas the swamp, floodplain and shallow areas tended to decrease during the period from 1985 to 2005. Those changes caused wetland carbon stock to decrease. The conversion of other land use categories to wetland was the primary cause of carbon stock loss. Therefore, it is more beneficial for China to decrease per capita carbon emissions by decreasing carbon emissions from the conversion of other land use categories to wetlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Membrane compatibility and its characterization to determine the potential applicability for H2S separation
AB  - Development of new technology in the area of separation process is essential in order to deal with with product quality, environmental issues, energy efficiency, cost reduction and increasing safety. In membrane separation processes, membrane contactor has attained considerable attention due to the wide range of its applications. Since most of chemical separation processes are related to the contact of two different phases (liquid-liquid or gas/vapor-liquid), the operations such as gas absorption and stripping, liquidliquid extraction, distillation, heterogeneous reactions, emulsification, demulsification, humidification and dehumidification can be conducted through a membrane contactor system (Drioli et al. 2005). Development of membrane contactor for acid gas removal is an emerging technology recently especially to overcme the disadvantages of commercial packed towers and bubble columns. Physical solvents such as DEPG (Selexolâ„¢ or Coastal AGRÂ®), NMP or N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone (PurisolÂ®), Methanol (RectisolÂ®), and Propylene Carbonate (Fluor Solventâ„¢) are well known as commercial gas treating solvents, especially for acid gas removal. Physical solvents tend to be favored over chemical solvents when the concentration of acid gases or other impurities is very high (Burr and Lyddon 2008). Among the physical solvents, Selexol shows the highest H2S solubility. However, due to Selexol solvent is less hazard as compared to NMP, this compatibility study was conducted using Selexol as the solvent for H2S removal with various types of polymeric membrane material. The main objective of the study was to test the stability of potential porous membrane material with the selected physical absorbent for H2S removal. From the physical characterization consist of physical abservation, Fe-SEM, FTIR and contact angle that have been conducted on the membranes that have been immersed in the physical absorbent for 1 month, it is found that 3 membrane materials are most stable and compatible with the selected physical absorbent. The 3 shortlisted membrane material are PTFE, PP and PEEK membrane that could be further developed for H2S removal using membrane contactor technology. Â© 2018 Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Negative feedback in the cold: ice retreat produces new carbon sinks in Antarctica
AB  - Feedbacks on climate change so far identified are predominantly positive, enhancing the rate of change. Loss of sea-ice, increase in desert areas, water vapour increase, loss of tropical rain forest and the restriction of significant areas of marine productivity to higher latitude (thus smaller geographical zones) all lead to an enhancement of the rate of change. The other major feedback identified, changes in cloud radiation, will produce either a positive feedback, if high level clouds are produced, or a negative feedback if low level clouds are produced. Few significant negative feedbacks have been identified, let alone quantified. Here, we show that the loss of ice shelves and retreat of coastal glaciers around the Antarctic Peninsula in the last 50 years has exposed at least 2.4 x 104 km2 of new open water. We estimate that these new areas of open water have allowed new phytoplankton blooms containing a total standing stock of similar to 5.0 x 105 tonnes of carbon to be produced. New marine zooplankton and seabed communities have also been produced, which we estimate contain similar to 4.1 x 105 tonnes of carbon. This previously unquantified carbon sink acts as a negative feedback to climate change. New annual productivity, as opposed to standing stock, amounts to 3.5 x 106 tonnes yr-1 of carbon, of which 6.9 x 105 tonnes yr-1 deposits to the seabed. By comparison the total aboveground biomasses of lowland American tropical rainforest is 160-435 tonnes ha-1. Around 50\% of this is carbon. On this basis the carbon held in new biomass described here is roughly equivalent to 6000-17 000 ha of tropical rainforest. As ice loss increases in polar regions this feedback will become stronger, and eventually, over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, over 50 Mtonnes of new carbon could be fixed annually in new coastal phytoplankton blooms and over 10 Mtonnes yr-1 locked in biological standing stock around Antarctica.

TI  - Modelling the effects of climate change on the energy system-A case study of Norway
AB  - The overall objective of this work is to identify the effects of climate change on the Norwegian energy system towards 2050. Changes in the future wind- and hydro-power resource potential, and changes in the heating and cooling demand are analysed to map the effects of climate change. The impact of climate change is evaluated with an energy system model, the MARKAL Norway model, to analyse the future cost optimal energy system. Ten climate experiments, based on five different global models and six emission scenarios, are used to cover the range of possible future climate scenarios and of these three experiments are used for detailed analyses. This study indicate that in Norway, climate change will reduce the heating demand, increase the cooling demand, have a limited impact on the wind power potential, and increase the hydro-power potential. The reduction of heating demand will be significantly higher than the increase of cooling demand, and thus the possible total direct consequence of climate change will be reduced energy system costs and lower electricity production costs. The investments in offshore wind and tidal power will be reduced and electric based vehicles will be profitable earlier. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Design, Choice of Material, Manufacture and Testing of Offshore Equipment. [KONSTRUKTION, WERKSTOFFAUSWAHL, VERARBEITUNG UND PRUEFUNG VON OFFSHORE-GERAETEN.]
AB  - Offshore technological constructions have to endure severe operating conditions. They are employed in areas of various nature with differing environmental influences. Safety requirements of these constructions are extremely strict because of the great risks involved, expecially in the exploitation of oil and gas. Therefore, the design, choice of material and testing of the constructions and their parts are carried out with greatest care considering all their characteristics. An analysis of the strains allows for a significant weldable design, the use of most suitable steel types and an objective and effective quality guarantee for all parts of these constructions enduring strains of varying intensity. In this article, the most significant aspects are covered without going into detail.

TI  - Research on Electrical Radiation of Marine Functional Materials Based on Negative Feedback Control System
AB  - In marine organisms the carbon sink function of shellfish moves in circles. It not only has a great influence on the marine environment, also has the very important significance for the construction of marine ranching to realize the benefits of recycling economy. If the carbon consumption exceeds marine soil and Photosynthesis Carbon input, the marine environment will be subject to different degrees damage, and affect the marine farming production process. Based on this, this paper analyses and studies the shellfish and algae carbon sink function. The first part of this paper introduces shellfish and algae carbon sink regulation function, gives the schematic diagram of carbon cycle, and establishes a column chart through using the preliminary statistical data. The second part establishes the shellfish and algae carbon sink ecological economic system mathematical model in the construction of marine ranching, and gives the adjustment function diagram of ecosystem's two coordination function. The third part uses the professional statistical analysis software SAS to draw the shellfish and algae carbon curve of marine ranching construction, which provides theoretical reference for considering the carbon sink function of marine ranching construction.

TI  - Process integration approaches to optimal planning of unconventional gas field development
AB  - In recent years, the oil and gas industry has been moving to develop unconventional gas fields, which include those contaminated with high carbon dioxide (CO2) content. Typically, the CO2 has to be separated from the natural gas (NG) in offshore processing facilities (in situ) before the NG can be sent for processing at the gas plant onshore. To date, commercial-scale CO2 capture and storage (CCS) has proven to be viable mainly for CO2 that is separated from NG and subsequently injected at or near the gas field itself for permanent storage (CO2 sequestration) or utilized for the purpose of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). In the case of multiple adjacent reservoirs exhibiting variations in NG quality and CO2 content, it may be necessary to have in situ CO2 removal using NG sweetening processes (e.g. membrane or amine absorption) to achieve a quality level such that the pooled NG streams meets the sales gas specification required for further processing at an onshore facility for sales. In this work, new process integration approaches are proposed to aid in the integrated planning of such joint field development projects, to rationalize the development of contaminated gas fields together with conventional sweet gas fields in meeting the required sales gas specifications of CO2 content. These approaches are based on analogous techniques previously developed for distributed effluent treatment systems and carbon capture planning for the power generation sector. A case study is used to illustrate how general insight-based policies for gas field development can be drawn from process integration perspectives. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Numerical modeling of CO2 injection scenarios in petroleum reservoirs: Application to CO2 sequestration and EOR
AB  - CO2 injection is a most promising method for enhancing oil recovery from petroleum reservoirs especially from depleted one. CO2 injection can be employed as secondary and tertiary enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods. The most prominent advantage of CO2 injection is reducing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and consequently reducing environmental problems. Different approaches have been employed to study the performance of CO2 in increasing oil production including miscible/immiscible injection, carbonated water injection (CWI) and CO2 injection into aquifer. In these methods different parameters can effect such as minimum miscible pressure (MMP), injection rate and so forth. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to study of different CO2 injection methods and the effect of operational factors on the performance of each method by a numerical simulation model. In this study, a synthetic reservoir is considered for numerical simulation of CO2 injection process. To assess this goal, three different CO2 injection strategies including CO2 injection into the bottom aquifer, CO2 injection into oil column (pay-zone) and simultaneous CO2 injection into aquifer and pay-zone are defined. Based on the results obtained from three aforementioned injection scenarios, simultaneous CO2 injection into aquifer and pay-zone leads to higher oil recovery factor in comparison with other scenarios. Critical injection rate for each scenario was determined and employed in the case of simultaneous CO2 injection into aquifer and pay-zone. Moreover, at the same CO2 injection rate, injection into aquifer leads to produce more oil compared to CO2 injection into the pay-zone. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - GluBiÂ® Pipe - A new development of a reelable lined pipe
AB  - For two decades the mechanically lined pipe has been applied as onshore and offshore pipeline in the oil and gas transportation. Up to now more than 1,000 kilometres of this kind of linepipes have been installed. In the past the main offshore installation methods for mechanically lined pipes were S-lay, J-lay or Bundle. The objective was to produce a reelable mechanically lined pipe with dimensions of 6 up to 18" without any further procedures such as application of internal pressure or reinforcements of the liner material. Over the last years, various approaches were investigated to prepare the mechanically lined pipe for the reeling technique which is much more efficient and economic than the above mentioned installation methods. The manufacturing process of the new product is based on the process of the mechanically lined pipe called BuBiÂ®. A CRA pipe is expanded inside a carbon steel pipe, using a hydroforming process. Between the two pipes a glue is coated to produce adhesion. The pipe ends are welded using a weld overlay method. The main development work was finding a solution of the welding at a glued pipe end. This was successfully done. The result is a glued Iinepipe called GIuBiÂ® having the same weldability and processability properties as the well-known mechanically lined pipes and it is reelable without the risk of wrinkling. Furthermore the strength and corrosions resisting properties as well meet the requirements of the onshore and offshore oil and gas transportation. Currently the new product development is going through the DNV qualification DNV-RP-A203. The market launch is planned for 2017. The main benefit of the new product, the glued mechanically lined pipe, is the cost saving factor. The reeling process can be faster because the pipe section does not have to be filled and pressurized with water. Another advantage is the lighter weight. The vessel is able to load more pipes. The glued mechanically lined pipe is a reasonable completion of the metallurgically clad pipe and the conventional mechanically lined pipe. It will find its place in the future of the oil and gas business. Â©2017, Offshore Technology Conference.

AB  - This time, our research group focused on the effect of high concentrations of fulvic acid produced at the bottom of the dam, using a high concentration fulvic acid iron elution unit, in a real sea area where barren ground is progressing. By conducting demonstration experiments on the algae field recovery of the dam reservoir, it is going to develop for the practical application of technological development for effective utilization of lake bottom deposits. We have used steelmaking slag made from blast furnace as a material to promote dissolution of divalent iron ions in the past development process, but from this time we have found more effective materials, we have manufactured from electric furnace converter A material containing high concentration divalent iron ions was adopted. This is a material containing high concentrations of divalent iron ions which is 100 times higher than the steelmaking slag that has been adopted so far. Regarding the commercialization of this research and development overseas, it is scheduled to apply in Korea the first time in East Asia. In addition, we propose a new calculation formula for CO2 absorption (carbon conversion) by seaweed bed construction, and the annual fixing by the algae of Japan is estimated to be about 3 million tons. It is expected that future development of research and development utilizing this technology will be commercialized in areas such as tidal banks as a port conservation technology and construction for forming seaweed bed and seawall maintenance etc. Research and development in this area has attracted attention as a technique for improving the quality of cultured laver as application technology in recent years, technology for restoring seaweed beds and improving the production of agricultural products in recent years.

TI  - Impacts of deep-sea mining on microbial ecosystem services
AB  - Interest in extracting mineral resources from the seafloor through deep-sea mining has accelerated in the past decade, driven by consumer demand for various metals like zinc, cobalt, and rare earth elements. While there are ongoing studies evaluating potential environmental impacts of deep-sea mining activities, these focus primarily on impacts to animal biodiversity. The microscopic spectrum of seafloor life and the services that this life provides in the deep sea are rarely considered explicitly. In April 2018, scientists met to define the microbial ecosystem services that should be considered when assessing potential impacts of deep-sea mining, and to provide recommendations for how to evaluate and safeguard these services. Here, we indicate that the potential impacts of mining on microbial ecosystem services in the deep sea vary substantially, from minimal expected impact to loss of services that cannot be remedied by protected area offsets. For example, we (1) describe potential major losses of microbial ecosystem services at active hydrothermal vent habitats impacted by mining, (2) speculate that there could be major ecosystem service degradation at inactive massive sulfide deposits without extensive mitigation efforts, (3) suggest minor impacts to carbon sequestration within manganese nodule fields coupled with potentially important impacts to primary production capacity, and (4) surmise that assessment of impacts to microbial ecosystem services at seamounts with ferromanganese crusts is too poorly understood to be definitive. We conclude by recommending that baseline assessments of microbial diversity, biomass, and, importantly, biogeochemical function need to be considered in environmental impact assessments of deep-sea mining.

Many people, including environmentalists, consider nuclear energy to be the only viable energy source for the future global economy in that it does not contribute to climate change. It is difficult for us to consider the full scope of the risks that accompany decisions to embrace nuclear energy as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, however, because lessons learned about radiation remain secret or silenced.

TI  - A Study on applying the Catfish Biofuel in The Mekong Delta for The Marine Diesel Engine
AB  - The manufacturing of Catfish products has been developed rapidly in the Mekong delta. Every year, about 1.2 million tons of Catfish and 150,000 tons of biofuel are produced. The biofuel B100 manufactures in Mekong delta satisfies the America standard ASTM D6751; EURO EN 14214 or Vietnamese standard TCVN 7717. Mekong delta, a lower land area, has a large inland water way system with around 100.000 river boats that operate with marine diesel engine. Using the biofuel for the marine diesel engine in area will reduce the HC, CO, SOx and NOx emission to the environment. Therefore, with a study on applying the catfish biofuel, it will reduce the climate change by the increasing of sea water level and save energy by using green energy to replace petrol oil.

TI  - Remineralization and preservation of sedimentary organic carbon, and authigenic mineral formation in Alian Bay and its adjacent areas, China: Implication for the influence of abalone (Haliotis discus hannai Ino)and kelp (Saccharina japonica)mariculture
AB  - Although mariculture activities play a significant role in coastal carbon cycling, there is a lack of research on sedimentary organic carbon (SOC)in mariculture areas. In this study, remineralization of SOC in Ailian Bay, China, and an adjacent offshore control area was analyzed by combining sediment and pore water analyses, to investigate the effects of mariculture on the preservation of SOC and the related mechanisms. The significant higher total organic carbon (TOC)to sediment surface area in abalone culture area (0.74 Â± 0.10 mgÂ·mâˆ’2)than those in control area (0.59 Â± 0.06 mgÂ·mâˆ’2)suggested the maricultural activities may increase the preservation efficiency of SOC. During anaerobic incubations, higher vertical profiles and production rates of Î£CO2 in pore water of sediments in the abalone culture area than those in the control area indicated that maricultural activities may increase the rate of organic carbon remineralization. Furthermore, similar findings in dissolved organic carbon (DOC)suggested maricultural activities may increase the release of DOC in the sedimentary environment, which is an important supplement to the marine DOC pool. Additionally, the higher vertical concentrations and fluxes of the three major cations (i.e., K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+)coupled with the increased rate of SOC remineralization in the abalone culture area demonstrated that the maricultural activities strongly strengthened the formation of authigenic mineral. In conclusion, these findings suggested that maricultural activities play an important role in the coastal carbon cycle, significantly affecting the remineralization, preservation of SOC and the biogeochemical cycling of other important biogenic elements.

TI  - Prototype balloon for inspection of offshore platforms powered by renewable energy controlled by electronics prototyping platform
AB  - The purpose of this research is the development of a prototype balloon anchored to a vessel for inspection of offshore platforms and monitoring of environmental damage with the use of solar panels, infrared camera and controlled by an Arduino platform. The possible environmental damage in offshore platforms require continuous monitoring as prevention and for repairs in case of accident, in this study the tool used for monitoring must provide continuous and uninterrupted monitoring of activities at a lower cost of operation. The method applied was the use of a balloon anchored to a vessel for continuous monitoring using an infrared camera as prevention and assistance for repairs in case of accidents occurring in open sea and various other situations in environmental damage inspections. The balloon will use helium gas for floating and a powertrain only for forced positioning, as the most part of the time it will be conducted with the wind to the sides, up and down through remotely controlled rudder. The use of other monitoring devices show several limitations when compared to the use of balloons, their great advantage is the autonomy compared to a drone (approximately 20 minutes) and the cost of operating a helicopter, thus, the cost-benefit enables its construction. The use of solar panels as a power source for batteries is an efficient solution for keeping its load, being applied for the continuous operation of equipment. The Arduino platform is a resource for various applications and its use in this prototype applies for the control and management of the following components that will be part of the monitoring balloon: solar plates, various sensors, GPS, motors and servo motors.

TI  - Impact of a novel coating on inorganic scale deposit growth and adhesion
AB  - The deposition and growth of scale on the internal surface of oil & gas pipelines is a major challenge in the operation and maintenance of these lines. Pigging and chemical treatment are currently available solutions, but these are expensive, and a permanent passive alternative would be preferable. Diamond Like Coatings (DLC) have shown considerable promise, but the industry remains skeptical in the absence of conclusive evidence. This work addresses the question for a novel super hydrophobic DLC with a parametric evaluation of factors affecting adhesion and growth of common scale groups (such as Calcites and Barites) including surface finish of the substrate, metal composition, and thickness (or presence) of the coating, as well as the differing mechanisms of scale growth where applicable. The approach involves controlled deposition of inorganic scales onto rotational cylindrical electrodes (RCE) under varying conditions of temperature, solution chemistry, flow rates, followed by submerged jet impingement to quantify the corresponding deposit bond strengths and failure modes (cohesion vs. adhesion). Design of Experiments (DOE) methods are used to set and analyze the contribution of deposition and matrix factors simultaneously. Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Energy and environmental simple analysis of diesel engines fueled with producer gas and biodiesel from animal fats
AB  - The world's oil reserves are a non-renewable resource, thus eventually be depleted. On the other hand the harmful effects to human health caused by the emission of pollutants produced by the combustion of petroleum products, is a growing problem, reason for which efforts have knotted for the development of clean technologies that achieve a reduction of these emissions. One of the main sources of emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides are Diesel engines. These motors can be used in a wide range of applications, which include automotive, power generation, marine applications, among others. One of the technologies developed for the mitigation of pollutant emissions in Diesel engines, is the use of gas as a fuel partial supplement of the liquid fuel. These engines are known as dual engines, in which a mixture of air / fuel gas is sucked and is powered by a pilot injection of liquid fuel. In automotive engines, sudden changes of speed and load present a great difficulty for the development of this technology, which makes engines for stationary power generation in one of the leading candidates for adoption of this technology. The gaseous fuel can be obtained from non-renewable and renewable sources. The partial combustion of biomass in the gasifiers generates a Manufactured Gas that can be used as a renewable source of fuel for application in dual engines. Animal fats are a very attractive raw material for biodiesel production, due to its low price as it is a byproduct of the processing of meats. The commercial technologies available for the operation of engines operating with manufactured gas are scarce, and virtually zero in the case of the operation with Biodiesel from animal fat as fuel pilot. These reasons have led the authors to propose a scheme for conversion of 100 %Diesel engines for its operation in dual mode Biodiesel/Manufactured Gas. For the development of such a scheme of converting it is necessary to evaluate the power and environmental performance of the machine in the dual operating mode, so that the components and strategies designed meet the requirements Â© 2009 by ABCM.

TI  - Estimation of aboveground and belowground carbon stocks in urban freshwater wetlands of Sri Lanka
AB  - Background The occurrence of climate change at an unprecedented scale has resulted in alterations of ecosystems around the world. Numerous studies have reported on the potential to slow down climate change through the sequestration of carbon in soil and trees. Freshwater wetlands hold significant potential for climate change mitigation owing to their large capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Wetlands among all terrestrial ecosystems have the highest carbon density and are found to store up to three to five times more carbon than terrestrial forests. The current study was undertaken to quantify carbon stocks of two carbon pools: aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB). Chosen study sites; Kolonnawa wetland and Thalawathugoda wetland park are distributed within the Colombo wetland complex. Colombo was recognized as one of the 18 global Ramsar wetland cities in 2018. A combination of field measurements and allometric tree biomass regression models was used in the study. Stratification of the project area was performed using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Results The AGB carbon stock, across strata, is estimated to be in the range of 13.79 +/- 3.65-66.49 +/- 6.70 tC/ha and 8.13 +/- 2.42-52.63 +/- 10.00 tC/ha at Kolonnawa wetland and Thalawathugoda wetland park, respectively. The BGB carbon stock is estimated to be in the range of 2.47 +/- 0.61-10.12 +/- 0.89 tC/ha and 1.56 +/- 0.41-8.17 +/- 1.39 tC/ha at Kolonnawa wetland and Thalawathugoda wetland park, respectively. The total AGB carbon stock of Kolonnawa wetland was estimated at 19,803 +/- 1566 tCO(2)eq and that of Thalawathugoda wetland park was estimated at 4180 +/- 729 tCO(2)eq. Conclusions In conclusion, the study reveals that tropical freshwater wetlands contain considerable potential as carbon reservoirs. The study suggests the use of tropical freshwater wetlands in carbon sequestration enhancement plans in the tropics. The study also shows thatAnnona glabra, an invasive alien species (IAS), has the potential to enhance the net sink of AGB carbon in these non-mangrove wetlands. However, further studies are essential to confirm if enhanced carbon sequestration byAnnona glabrais among the unexplored and unreported benefits of the species.

TI  - Emissions assessment of bulk carriers in China's east Coast-Yangtze River maritime network based on different shipping modes
AB  - In the past decades, resources such as iron ore were transported to the upper-middle reaches of the Yangtze River by river-sea combined mode in order to support the rapid economic development of Yangtze River Economic Zone. However, emissions from vessels have caused serious negative effect on the environment along the Yangtze River. Therefore, the Chinese government took a series of measures so as to control the emissions in this area. This paper draws comparisons among river-sea combined mode, river-sea mode and mixed mode (combination of the river-sea combined mode and river-sea mode) based on the ship emissions inventory of SOx , PM10, PM2.5 , NOx, CO, HC, CO2, N2O and CH4 for 13 common cases in the existing network by bottom-up method. In addition, the paper carries out in-depth analyses, providing evidence for future ship operation directions. The results indicate river-sea mode and mixed mode which implement river-sea vessels record less unit emissions compared to the traditional river-sea combined mode. Moreover, shorter transshipment (lightning) times, proper ports of transshipping and cleaner fuels are able to reduce ship emissions significantly. Hence, we conclude that first, river-sea vessels should be encouraged; second, the initiative of a deep-water channel of the Yangtze River should be continued; and last, stricter regulations of fuels have played a significant role in reducing ship emissions.

TI  - Dissolution behavior of a CO2 droplet at the CO2 sequestration into mid-depth sea
AB  - Sequestration of liquid CO2 in intermediate depth ocean has been considered as a means to reduce atmospheric concentration of the greenhouse gas and to mitigate global warming. The dissolution behavior of CO2 in pure/sea water was investigated under the conditions of the intermediate depth ocean, i. e., high pressure and low temperature conditions. In these conditions, CO2 clathrate hydrate film was formed at the interface between CO2 and water. The solubility of CO2 was derived by measuring the shrinking rates of the diameter of CO2 droplet. The solubility was investigated qualitatively with changing pressure, salinity and temperature. It was clarified that the solubility increased with the increase of pressure and salinity. The hydrate film, which was formed at low temperature condition, much affected the solubility.The authors applied a laser induced fluorescence (LIF) technique for the measurement of pH distribution around a CO2 droplet dissolving into pure water with or without the hydrate film. CO2 solution emitted intense fluorescence dependently on its pH. The visualized images of pH distribution, CO2 concentration around the dissolving CO2 droplet was calculated.

TI  - Ammonia as a potential marine fuel: A review
AB  - The rising share of renewable energy sources (RES) in the energy mix and the desire to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and harmful substances have driven broad-based technological advances on a global scale. In recent years, Millennium and Sustainable Development Goals have appeared, seeking to improve and level up standards of living while protecting the environment. Coupled with this, regulations are regularly issued that set increasingly stringent limits on emissions. This review examines the opportunities and challenges facing the maritime sector in light of the game-changing goals set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). First, the review gives a short introduction to RES and considers the feasibility of producing green hydrogen and using ammonia as a carrier. It goes on to discuss the use of ammonia as a marine fuel from a technological, scientific, economic, and legal regulations point of view. The impact of emission regulations on the maritime sector and the challenges of bringing ammonia on board ships are factored in. Finally, the paper presents a technical justifi-cation for using solid oxide fuel cells to boost the efficiency of energy conversion.

TI  - The solution-focused design process organization approach applied from ship design to offshore platforms design
AB  - The objective of this work is to describe and discuss a design process organization approach named ``solution-focused design.{''} This method has been created and used successfully for advanced marine vehicles (AMV), ship and offshore platform design over the last ten years with reasonable advantages. It was first created in a context where the decision of what concept to be adopted supersedes the use of the classical design spiral, suggesting a combination of the spiral with morphological charts, since the design processes of the concurring concepts are completely different from each other The advantages are in terms of allowing for the introduction of creative ideas into the conceptual design process, eventually leading to an innovative product or design solution, establishing a sound design sequence and rationalizing the search for design tools and knowledge, parameter and task organization and classification (free variables, restrictions, performance specifications), and the design process itself. In this work the solution-focused design process is described and compared to some usual ones, which normally rely on ``problem-focused{''} strategies for problem solving. It is shown how the process evolves from a preestablished scenario and a design briefing or specification to a design methodology. This is done in brainstorming sessions, using sketches and interactive design flowcharts (similar to design spirals), adapted for this approach. The objective is to provide the designer with means to define quickly and efficiently the optimal configuration of the design, while incorporating novelties into it. In order to show some features of the approach, three different examples of designs previously developed are presented: one for a SPAR Buoy Platform, another for a floating production, storage, and offloading unit (FPSO), and another for the feasibility and concept of a ``fully submersible fast boat.{'' This last one shows features from which the method evolved from AWV's to offshore platforms' design: detailed morphological comparisons of different concepts, in this case, of means of support.

TI  - Lateral Export and Sources of Subsurface Dissolved Carbon and Alkalinity in Mangroves: Revising the Blue Carbon Budget
AB  - Mangroves are carbon-rich ecosystems that store large quantities of carbon, mostly in soils. Early carbon (C) budgets indicated that >50\% of mangrove C fixation was unaccounted for. This `missing C' has now been discovered to be a large release (423 Tg C a(-1)) of porewater dissolved DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and total alkalinity (17 T-MOL a(-1)) via lateral export derived from bacterial decomposition of soil organic matter. This large export originates from DIC produced over at least a 1.0-1.5 m soil profile (280-420 Tg C a(-1)) via decomposition of autochthonous and allochthonous inputs and/or likely mineralization in deep (>= 1 m) ancient soils. DOC and DIC export from mangroves equate to 41\% and approximate to 100\% of export from the world's tropical rivers, respectively. A newly revised blue carbon budget for the world's mangroves indicates a mean ecosystem gross primary production (GPP(E)) to ecosystem respiration (R-E) ratio of 1.35 and a net ecosystem production (NEP) of 794 g C m(-2) a(-1) (= global NEP of 117 Tg C a(-1)), reflecting net autotrophy. C-ORG burial is 5\% and 9\% of GPP(E) and NEPE, respectively. Mean R(E/)GPP(E) is 0.74 and carbon use efficiency averages 0.57, higher than for tropical humid forests (0.35).

TI  - The role of archaeology in offshore site investigation for renewable developments
AB  - The importance of mitigating the impact of offshore renewable energy developments and their associated infrastructure on the marine historic environment has been widely recognised by the Crown Estate, developers and curators for a number of years. Over the last 15 years offshore renewable schemes have given archaeologists access to large areas of seafloor that would not have otherwise been subject to archaeological investigation. Marine archaeology is a constantly evolving field, and understanding of it is increasing as more offshore developments take place. The initial assessment of the archaeological resource within a development area begins at the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) stage. As the project progresses the archaeological mitigation works are covered by a Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) setting out the need for further, targeted archaeological assessments using data acquired during the site investigation process. This allows archaeologists to refine their understanding of what material is present within the development area and to adjust their advice accordingly. This paper shows examples of how archaeological sites are identified and studied using standard site investigation techniques, along with possible mitigation strategies.

TI  - Effective SNR Mapping and Link Adaptation Strategy for Next-Generation Underwater Acoustic Communications Networks: A Cross-Layer Approach
AB  - Interest in the study of next-generation underwater sensor networks for ocean investigation has increased owing to developing concerns over its utilization in areas, such as oceanography, commercial operations in maritime areas, and military surveillance. The underwater base station controller, in the form of a surface buoy, communicates with underwater base stations (UBSs) while the UBSs transceiver information with underwater sensor nodes via acoustic communications. This paper provides a link-level and system-level study of downlinks using an orthogonal frequency-division multiple access techniques for underwater acoustic communications (UAC) networks. We present an approach to link-level-to-system-level (L2S) mapping at the link level that provides an abstraction model of the link-level performance to be accessed by system-level simulation (SLS). In this paper, an exponential effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) mapping (EESM) method is adopted, which elaborates on how multi-state channels are integrated into a single state in an SLS, and why an effective SNR can represent the characteristics of a multiple subcarrier SNR. Moreover, we explain the beta calibration procedure in detail for a UAC network. The simulation results are provided to verify the beta calibration of the UAC network. Furthermore, we employ a link adaptation strategy by evaluating system throughput based on a proportional fair (PF) scheduler at the system level. Hence, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of link adaptation strategy for UAC networks.

TI  - An energy and carbon life cycle assessment of tidal power case study: The proposed Cardiff-Weston severn barrage scheme
AB  - Under the Kyoto Protocol many countries have targets to reduce carbon emissions and increase renewable energy production. In order to do this effectively the impact and efficacy of differing schemes must be determined. One option for producing electricity is through the use of a tidal barrage. The largest potential barrage scheme considered in the UK is the Cardiff-Weston barrage scheme in the Severn estuary. The scheme would be a single, renewable installation and is predicted to constitute 4% of the UK electricity supply. Therefore a carbon and energy assessment was completed on the Cardiff-Weston Severn barrage scheme. The assessment shows that the energy and carbon intensity of the Severn barrage is small in comparison to the National Grid mix and that, given reasonable assumptions, the Severn barrage can contribute to meeting the UK carbon reduction target. Importantly, the operation stage was identified as both the most energy and carbon intense by a large margin. This is a notable finding as preceding studies have tended to dismiss the consequences of the barrage operation as minimal or nil. Whilst these findings are for the Cardiff-Weston barrage, the implications will be similar for tidal barrages in other sites in the UK and globally. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Ocean disposal of CO2: Conditions for producing sinking CO2 hydrate
AB  - Carbon dioxide sequestration at intermediate ocean depths in the form of a sinking CO2 stream has been shown to be technically feasible. Buoyancy characteristics Of CO2 hydrate particles obtained from a coflow reactor operating under conditions that produce negatively buoyant CO2 hydrate composite particles were studied. Using a simplified process model, the limiting ratios Of CO2 to water to produce sinking hydrate composite streams were established for pressure and temperature conditions of intermediate ocean depths. A kinetic model involving a mass transfer step and a reaction step was proposed to explain experimental data using a seafloor process simulator. Results suggest that the reactor operates under mass-transfer controlled conditions. Although the density of freshwater is only a few percentage units less than that of seawater, operating conditions derived from freshwater-based studies are significantly different for ambient seawater. Owing to the higher density of seawater, greater conversion Of CO2 to hydrate is needed to obtain a sinking CO2 composite stream than at the same depth of freshwater.

TI  - Unconventional hydrocarbons - From Niche to mainstream. AAPG annual convention New Orleans, April 12 - 15, 2010
AB  - AAPG Annual Convention, held in New Orleans, US, from April 12 - 15, 2010, focused on unconventional hydrocarbons as a significant topic. The annual convention also considered shale gas, tight sandstone gas, and coalbed methane to be a part of the core business of US companies, belonging to the regular activities. The participants were informed that unconventional gas, including shale gas, were having a significant impact on the country's energy balance and on world energy supplies. It has been observed that around 15% of the domestic gas production is provided by shale gas alone and this share is rapidly rising. Unconventional gas technology, mainly the progress in horizontal and multilateral drilling and multi-fraccing is emerging as the biggest innovation step in energy. Advanced technology has allowed the industry to start to access the large amounts of hydrocarbons that have been stuck in the wastezones.

TI  - In situ arsenic immobilisation for coastal aquifers using stimulated iron cycling: Lab-based viability assessment
AB  - Arsenic (As) is one of the most harmful and widespread groundwater contaminants globally. Besides the occurrence of geogenic As pollution, there is also a large number of sites that have been polluted by anthropogenic activities, with many of those requiring active remediation to reduce their environmental impact. Costeffective remedial strategies are however still sorely needed. At the laboratory-scale in situ formation of magnetite through the joint addition of nitrate and Fe(II) has shown to be a promising new technique. However, its applicability under a wider range of environmental conditions still needs to be assessed. Here we use sediment and groundwater from a severely polluted coastal aquifer and explore the efficiency of nitrate-Fe(II) treatments in mitigating dissolved As concentrations. In selected experiments >99\% of dissolved As was removed, compared to unamended controls, and maintained upon addition of lactate, a labile organic carbon source. Pre-and post experimental characterisation of iron (Fe) mineral phases suggested a >90\% loss of amorphous Fe oxides in favour of increased crystalline, recalcitrant oxide and sulfide phases. Magnetite formation did not occur via the nitrate-dependent oxidation of the amended Fe(II) as originally expected. Instead, magnetite is thought to have formed by the Fe(II)-catalysed transformation of pre-existing amorphous and crystalline Fe oxides. The extent of amorphous and crystalline Fe oxide transformation was then limited by the exhaustion of dissolved Fe(II). Elevated phosphate concentrations lowered the treatment efficacy, indicating joint removal of phosphate is necessary for maximum impact. The remedial efficiency was not impacted by varying salinities, thus rendering the tested approach a viable remediation method for coastal aquifers.

TI  - Advanced acoustic telemetry system provides real-time data acquisition that increases efficiency in well testing operations
AB  - This paper discusses an innovative SRO system that takes advantage of state-of-the-art developments in acoustic technologies, wireline, and wireless transmission to acquire real-time, bottomhole SRO (surface read-out) data. In the past, in order to obtain this type of data, either a downhole latching system or a download probe in close proximity to the transmitting device had to be used. This acoustic data-acquisition system provides access to real-time bottomhole data using either a wireline-deployed probe or wireless acoustic signals sent through the production tubing. If the probe is used, this does not have to be close to the transmitting device in order to transfer the data to surface. Since the system offers the option of transmitting via wireline or via the wall of the testing pipe, the need for a probe or latching device along with the inherent problems that sometimes occur because the probe becomes stuck in the latch or mechanically fails can be eliminated. Finally, the additional rig time required for preparation and running of the probe to move the acoustic telemetry system (ATS) transmitter up to proper depth is saved, reducing operational costs. The system is compatible with tools conventionally used during drill stem test operations. Â© 2003, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Structural design of an offshore hydraulic energy-storing workover rig
AB  - After more than ten years' development, the functions of workover rigs in China can generally satisfy the demands of offshore oilfield production. For conventional workover rigs, large working space and guide rails are necessary, and they bring trouble to the workover operations. The high cost of manufacture, transportation, installation and running such general workover rigs is also an inevitable problem. Because of the advantages of the hydraulic energy-storing workover rigs, such as energy saving, environmental protection, small occupation and convenient installation, they have been widely used in onshore oilfields. In this paper, the preliminary structural design of a newly developed simple offshore workover rig will be introduced and the feasibility of applying this type of rig will be discussed.

TI  - A 5000 year record of carbon sequestration from a coastal lagoon and wetland complex, southern California, USA
AB  - Coastal wetlands have the potential to accumulate C at high rates over long time periods because they continuously accrete and bury organic-rich sediments, giving soils in coastal wetlands a distinct advantage over many other environments in the sequestration of organic C. Given that coastal wetlands are being lost worldwide, it is important to understand their C sequestration potential. Sediments in a southern California, USA coastal lagoon-wetland complex were cored, and depositional environments were interpreted. Suitable materials were radiocarbon dated. Bulk density and organic C were grouped by depositional environments, and average mass of C per unit volume and C accumulation rates in each depositional environment were calculated. The total organic C sequestered and rates of sequestration in each depositional environment were in the following order from most (fastest) to least (slowest): lagoon, intertidal, salt marsh, freshwater marsh, aeolian. This study demonstrated that high levels of organic C are sequestered per unit volume of sediment (35.9Â±3.2 kg m-3), and the mean rate of C accumulation was high (0.033Â±0.0029 kg C m-2 year -1) over a long time period (5000 years). Results of this study strongly demonstrate the importance and necessary high priority for preserving and restoring coastal wetlands both in the USA and internationally. However, despite their excellent potential to sequester C, significant losses of coastal wetlands are occurring in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Detecting Bending and Impact Events in a Fiber Optic Cable Using Distributed Acoustic Sensing to Assess Potential Offshore Power Cable Damges
AB  - A key vulnerability of offshore energy production facilities are submarine power cables. Monitoring a power cable during its entire lifetime is a strategy to minimize critical damages. Submarine power cables contain fiber optic cables that can be used for monitoring purposes. In this paper we show that a recent fiber optic sensing technique (CP-Î¦OTDR) [11] is capable of detecting bending and impact events in a fiber optic cable. It does so with a limited reproducibility however, which for impact events cannot be solely explained by the variability of the impact force. There is a slight signature present for impact events: identical impact force events correlate more than events belonging to non-identical forces. This work is a first step in developing a monitoring tool to help assess the severity of power cable damages due to incident impacts and critical bending states.

TI  - Proposing a potential strategy concerning Mineral-enhanced Biological Pump (MeBP) for improving Ocean Iron Fertilization (OIF)
AB  - Ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is a geoengineering strategy aimed at mitigating global warming by reducing the amount of atmospheric CO2. However, the efficacy by which OIF vertically exports organic carbon of bloomed phytoplankton (mostly, diatoms) to the deep sea is low because of the remineralization of organic carbon during the sinking of diatomaceous silica (BSi). To address the low efficiency of the vertical C export of OIF, a potential strategy for enhancing oceanic biological pump using clay minerals, so-called mineral-enhanced biological pump (MeBP), is proposed herein. Under ideal operation of MeBP, the purposefully added clay minerals are supposed to agglomerate with BSi, facilitating an increase in the quantity of BSi settling and a decrease of organic carbon loss. Meanwhile, the structural Al of clay minerals would be assimilated by diatoms due to the biological dissolution of the clays, inhibiting the dissolution of BSi during its sinking. The abovementioned effects would significantly improve the efficiency of the vertical C export of OIF. The preliminary evidence and arguments in support of MeBP are presented.

TI  - Reductions in cost and greenhouse gas emissions with new bulk ship designs enabled by the Panama Canal expansion
AB  - Historically, fuel costs have been small compared with the fixed costs of a bulk vessel, its crewing and management. Today, however, fuel accounts for more than 50% of the total costs. In combination with an introduction of stricter energy efficiency requirements for new vessels, this might make design improvement a necessity for all new bulk vessels. This is in contradiction to traditional bulk vessel designs, where the focus has been on maximizing the cargo-carrying capacity at the lowest possible building cost and not on minimizing the energy consumption. Moreover, the Panama Canal has historically been an important design criterion, while the new canal locks from 2014 will significantly increase the maximum size of vessels that can pass. The present paper provides an assessment of cost and emissions as a function of alternative bulk vessel designs with focus on a vessel's beam, length and hull slenderness, expressed by the length displacement ratio for three fuel price scenarios. The result shows that with slenderer hull forms the emissions drop. With today's fuel price of 600. USD per ton of fuel, emissions can thus be reduced by up to 15-25% at a negative abatement cost.

TI  - Distribution of the invasive Caprella mutica Schurin, 1935 and native Caprella linearis (Linnaeus, 1767) on artificial hard substrates in the North Sea: separation by habitat
AB  - Studying offshore natural and artificial hard substrates in the southern North Sea (51 degrees N-57 degrees N/1 degrees W-9 degrees E), the invasive introduced Japanese skeleton shrimp Caprella mutica Schurin, 1935 was found to co-exist with the native Caprella linearis (Linnaeus, 1767) only on near-shore locations that had an intertidal zone (e.g., wind farm foundations). In contrast, on far offshore and strictly subtidal locations, such as shipwrecks and rocky reefs, only C. linearis was found. Based on these exploratory observations, we hypothesised that artificial structures that are only subtidal are inhabited exclusively by C. linearis, and never by C. mutica. To test this hypothesis and understand factors driving each species' habitat preferences, habitat suitability models were constructed using generalised additive models, based on samples collected in 2013-2015 from offshore gas platforms, buoys, shipwrecks, and rocky reefs and combined with data from other published and unpublished surveys (2001-2014). The models showed that the presence of C. mutica is explained by the availability of intertidal and floating hard substrates, suspended particulate matter density (SPM), mean annual sea surface temperature, salinity, and current velocity. The C. linearis model included subtidal hard substrates, SPM, salinity, temperature, and current velocity. The modelled distributions showed a significant difference, demonstrating that C. linearis' habitat preference does not fully overlap with that of C. mutica. Thus, the native and alien Caprella species are likely to be able to co-exist in the North Sea.

TI  - Preventing dropped objects on offshore units and installations
AB  - ABS has published the first international class standard on the subject of dropped object prevention. The objective is to promote offshore safety through improved asset integrity management and the use of inherently safe design principals. This paper serves to increase dialog among owners, operators and manufacturers by presenting the drivers behind the development of the ABS standard and examples of what can be accomplished to achieve a dropped object free working environment. Dropped objects are among the top 3 causes of injuries in the work environment and accounted for 14% of fatalities in the US Upstream Oil and Gas Industry from 2003-2014. A summary of statistical information will be presented along with the results of research on regulatory requirements and current design standards. A brief history of dropped objects in the workplace as they relate to the historical development of safety systems will be discussed and the content of the ABS Guide for the Prevention of Dropped Objects on Offshore Units and Installations will be presented. Working with industry, ABS developed the first international standard addressing dropped object prevention on offshore units and installations to help reduce the chance of dropped object incidents, promote global safety, and lead a philosophical change in equipment design. Safety management systems in the offshore industry have evolved significantly over the past 40 years. As mechanical systems have become more prevalent and demand for larger equipment with greater capacities has grown, the amount of equipment that is both mounted at height and traverses over vertical and elevated horizontal planes has increased significantly. These technology developments have resulted in higher dropped object potential with a corresponding risk to the work environment. The approach taken to manage dropped objects in the offshore work environment has been to apply best practices for existing equipment. This method has been maturing over the past 7-10 years with significant advancements being made on recommended best practices within the last 3 years. The organization dropsonline.org, an Aberdeen, UK based member organization was formed in 1998 and consists of over 200 member companies and organizations that contribute to the ongoing development of best practices. Even with these efforts, one operator reports that nearly 25% of all of their incidents involve dropped objects and industry wide an estimated 10 percent of fatalities, thousands of incidents that require medical treatment and many avoidable lost-time injuries are the result of dropped objects. Although the industrial well construction capabilities of the latest generation of drilling units has been the focus of design changes to achieve greater efficiencies and capabilities, the design of outfitting type equipment has remained largely unchanged. Consequently, with the fitting of an increased amount of equipment used to improve the efficiency of well construction processes combined with an increase in outfitting type equipment, a corresponding increase in dropped objects has been experienced. The process of developing the ABS guide began with the end in mind. In order to understand what the end goal should look like, ABS engaged manufacturers and rig owners and acquired reference documents from oil and gas companies. Research was conducted on statistics of injuries and fatalities in the upstream oil and gas industry. This proved challenging due to the fact that the number of countries that report statistics is limited, the reporting criteria differ and the definitions of the causes vary. The most defined criteria came from the US through NIOSH (National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health). Statistics across all industries in the US between 1992 and 2002 are contained in Table 1 below: (Table Presented) In this study, fatalities caused by dropped objects is included in the general category of "Contact with Objects and Equipment, however, in a later study carried out over the 10 year period from 2002 to 2013, NIOSH also categorizes fatalities resulting from being struck by a falling object. For the period studied, there were 1221 fatalities reported in the upstream oil and gas industry, 171 of which were caused by the victim being struck by a falling object. Consequently, during this period, 14% of all fatalities in upstream oil and gas were caused by falling objects. The results of this research demonstrated the following facts: 1. Addressing dropped object prevention can lead to a significant reduction in associated injuries and fatalities. 2. Current best practices through dropsonline.org offer the best available means to manage drops prevention for existing equipment. Current national and international standards do not address this subject. 3. Prevention of dropped objects is not addressed in equipment design standards. These facts defined the end goal which was to produce an international class standard that incorporates industry best practices and provides requirements for the design of the outfitting and equipment that makes up the drops prevention program equipment register.

TI  - Process and Material Parameter Optimisation of Rotomoulded Polymer Foams
AB  - Polymer foams are essential for the manufacture of low cost, lightweight, buoyant structures typical of offshore energy generation devices. Careful balancing of material and processing conditions is essential to achieving a mechanically optimal cellular structure. To date, a convenient method for optimising rotationally moulded polymer foams has not been demonstrated. An offline experimental method was developed, and a preliminary study conducted, analysing the influence of processing and material parameters, such as polymer particle size or chemical blowing agent (CBA) concentration, on polymer cellular structures. The density of each sample was analysed, and image analysis software used to compare the amount of cell deterioration in each specimen cross-section. The method was found to be capable of indicating appropriate levels of each variable, offering a quicker route to foam optimality based on minimising density and preventing cell deterioration.

AB  - The following study investigates the development and implementation of a crack width measurement system through the use of piezo-ceramic sensors as part of an active non-destructive health monitoring system for reinforced concrete important structures. As the world demand for economic and sustainable energy rises, the demand for important structures such as long-span bridges, nuclear power containment and offshore platform development has also dramatically increased. These multibillion dollar state-of-the-art structures require the most reliable and durable monitoring system to ensure their most economic yet prudent operation. The proposed system uses permanently embedded low-cost sensors to actively assess the health conditions of concrete beams throughout their lifetime span. In the current investigation, a series of concrete beam specimens have been tested in the lab to examine the adequacy and accuracy of low-cost piezo-ceramic sensors under a bulk wave system. The estimated crack widths from the results of the proposed system instrument measurements agree very well with the crack gauge records from the theoretical estimates and tested beams. The test results confirm the calibration and validity of the proposed system. The proposed system can provide the means of establishing an active structural health monitoring system that not only provides details on the extent of damage, but also its location within a reinforced concrete member.

TI  - Intensifying Food and Housing at Sea
AB  - This chapter portrays emergent need in the context of climate change and rising global population, and proposes as counterpoints to megacities, resilient offshore and nearshore solutions to food production and supply, energy and wastewater management. Jack-ups, semi-submersibles and barges are repurposed into specialized vessels. Of key interest is a typology of a high-density housing on jack-up or semi-submersible to meet the rising population in capacities that surpass cities on modular floating rafts. The spatial quality of the architectural conversions capitalized on the use of derrick and deck structure, moonpool and pontoons to create spaces for communal gathering and for recreation. Infrastructure became architecture. The density and living quality of these propositions is explored through their range of communal recreation spaces. Theses are benchmarked with those of landed housing blocks in Singapore and landmark international examples. Â© 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Combination of solar disinfection (SODIS) with H2O2 for enhanced disinfection of marine aquaculture effluents
AB  - Technologically advanced recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS), developed for intensive farming, allows to recycle about 90â€“99% of water. As a result, accumulation of pathogenic bacteria in water often occurs and possesses threat of infectious fish diseases. The goal of this study was to evaluate feasibility of solar disinfection in combination with hydrogen peroxide for seawater and real marine aquaculture effluent. Specific roles of solar disinfection (SODIS), hydrogen peroxide and highly reactive oxidizing species (experiments conducted in presence of tert-butyl alcohol), generated in combined SODIS/H2O2 process were investigated. Natural consortia of Vibrio spp., known as highly resistant pathogen, present in seawater and real marine aquaculture effluent were chosen as target microorganisms. The SODIS/H2O2 process significantly enhances inactivation of natural Vibrio consortia (Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio owensii and Vibrio alfacsensis) in seawater in comparison with individual SODIS and H2O2 treatment. The best results in terms of Vibrio spp. inactivation efficiency was obtained with SODIS/H2O2 conducted using open channel raceway reactor. The efficiency of Vibrio spp. inactivation by SODIS/H2O2 in raceway and compound parabolic collector (CPC) reactors was found to be similar, requiring the dose of 28â€“29 Wh mâˆ’2 for complete inactivation of Vibrio spp. present in seawater. Absence of toxic effect of residual H2O2 for Nannochloropsis gaditana, as well as absence of Vibrio spp. regrowth (48 h) indicate suitability of SODIS/H2O2 process for inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in aquaculture effluent and following nutrients removal by microalgae. Moreover, feasibility of SODIS/H2O2 performed in raceway reactor for disinfection of real aquaculture effluent, containing more than 5â‹…103 CFU mLâˆ’1 of Vibrio harveyi, was demonstrated requiring the dose of 34.4 Wh mâˆ’2 for complete Vibrio spp. inactivation. The annual operation and maintenance cost of aquaculture effluent disinfection using CPC and raceway reactors were evaluated. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Biobutanol-{''}A Renewable Green Alternative of Liquid Fuel{''} from Algae
AB  - Increasing global energy demand, concern over global climate changes, and unstable and expensive petroleum resources, have led to the development of renewable energy sources that have driven research toward the utilization of biomass resources for the production of energy and fuels. In this context algae appear to be an emerging source of biomass for biobutanol that has the potential to give an alternative green solution to replace fossil fuel and reduce environmental issues. Biochemical production of butanol, a four carbon aliphatic alcohol, is promising due to its superior fuel properties as compared to ethanol. This chapter presents a comprehensive review on sustainable bioproduction and utilization of butanol as a biofuel and provides a glimpse on different potential biomass and microorganism for biochemical production of butanol. Main bottlenecks in biochemical production and recovery using conventional anaerobic acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation and corresponding recent counteractive steps to overcome these challenges were discussed systematically. A special emphasis has been given on the production of butanol a green alternative solution to fossil fuel using both micro- and macroalgae as potential biomass.

TI  - Elevated Atmospheric CO2 Increases Root Exudation of Carbon in Wetlands: Results from the First Free-Air CO2 Enrichment Facility (FACE) in a Marshland
AB  - Experiments employing free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) facilities have indicated that elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) stimulates growth in diverse terrestrial ecosystems. Studies of the effects of eCO(2) on wetland plants have indicated a similar response, but these studies were mostly performed in growth chambers. We conducted a 2-year FACE experiment {[}CO2 ae 582 A mu mol mol(-1)] in a marsh in Spain to test whether the common reed (Phragmites australis) responds to carbon enrichment, as previously reported in other macrophytes. More specifically, we tested the effect of eCO(2) on P. australis growth, photosynthesis, transpiration, and biomass, its effect on modifying plant and soil ratios of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, and whether the strong environmental variability of this wetland modulates these responses. Our findings show that effects of eCO(2) in this wetland environment are more complex than previously believed, probably due to hydrological effects. The effects of eCO(2) on reed plants were cumulative and manifested at the end of the growing season as increased 38-44\% instantaneous transpiration efficiency (ratio of net photosynthesis to transpiration), which was dependent on plant age. However, this increase did not result in a significant increase in biomass, because of excessive root exudation of carbon. These observations contrast with previous observations of wetland plants to increased atmospheric CO2 in growth chambers and shed new light on the role of wetland plants as a carbon sink in the face of global climate change. The combined effects of water stress, eCO(2), and soil carbon processes must be considered when assessing the function of wetlands as a carbon sink under global change scenarios.

TI  - Effects of CO2 enrichment on cockle shell growth interpreted with a Dynamic Energy Budget model
AB  - The increase in human induced atmospheric CO2 level leads to an increase in ocean acidification (OA). Mitigation of this increase by storage of CO2 in abandoned marine oil and gas reservoirs is seen as an interesting cost effective solution. However, this involves a risk of CO2 loss causing localised reductions in seawater pH. In this paper we report on the effects of CO2 enhancement on the growth of the bivalve Cerastoderma edule in mesocosms. The experiments show significant reductions in shell length, shell weight and cockle flesh dry weight at increased CO2 level suggesting both direct (shell erosion) and indirect (metabolic) effects. Indirect effects were analysed and interpreted using a Dynamic Energy Budget model by describing changes in 3 metabolic processes: assimilation, maintenance, and growth. Based on cockle size data only we could not differentiate between these processes, however, by using variability of DEB parameter values in 11 bivalve species, we showed growth to be the least relevant process.

TI  - Process optimisation in acid gas removal system
AB  - This paper mainly describes challenges in process design and operation optimization of Acid Gas Removal System with membrane separation technology in developing high CO2 gas fields. It concentrates on techniques and applications being used in CO2 Removal System of Arthit Offshore Processing Plant located in the Gulf of Thailand in which PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited (PTTEP) is an operator. This plant was designed based on export gas at 363 MMscfd with feed CO2 up to 40% and lower down to 23% in Sales gas. It is imperative for optimized CO2 Removal operations since it can minimize revenue losses as well as hydrocarbon releases to environment resulting in lower greenhouse gas emission. Formal methods are established for troubleshooting in case of %CO2 feed deviation from design, failure to meet sales gas specification, and high hydrocarbon losses. Membrane area adjustment was firstly implemented to match with feed CO2, and then performed operating condition optimization. The effects of the following factors which are very sensitive to the performance were examined such as: feed temperature, feed pressure, permeate pressure, feed flow rate and membrane area. Several performance tests were performed not only to fine-tune the best operating point, but also to analyze the effect of changing operating parameters in order to develop operating guideline for CO2 Removal process adjustment. This paper also discusses in the methodology to corroborate performance of membrane element which are carried out in order to minimize the loss of hydrocarbon gas as well as the costs of membrane element change-out. It is worthwhile for operators and engineers to translate the information gathers to serve as operating guidance to optimize process condition and maximize performance of Acid Gas Removal Units which can be certainly benefit to other fields with high CO2.

TI  - The Sea Flow Optimizing the Turbine to Produce the Electrical Energy for Fuel Consumption Reducing of Catamaran Ship
AB  - Since 1910 the first vessel utilized diesel engine as main booster, at once the oil became the main necessary of ship operation today, while the oil is one of unrenewable energy resources. In this era, the stock of oil is getting reduce, whereas the necessary of oil as the fuel is getting increase. To overcome this matter, the writer has innovation of hybrid system using for ship's propulsion which through the hulls of the catamaran for its function to boost the generator's turbine. Design as innovation elect of the ship's construction that witch is modified by pursing the inner hull so the flows velocity between the both hulls increase and the water flow could to stir the turbine that has been installed in the stern ship. The fuel consumption is more efficient, because the diesel generator helped by turbine generator to supplied electrical to the water jet pumps. The hybrid solution will lead to about up to 40\% reduced fuel consumption while operating the ship. As well as reduced capital costs compared to the conventional power generation system.

TI  - Reusing O&amp;G depleted reservoirs for CO2 storage: Pros and cons
AB  - Two main types of reservoirs are considered for geological storage of CO2: deep saline formations and depleted oil and gas reservoirs. The former offer very large potential capacity and a more even distribution, at the expense of high uncertainty due to the very poor characterization of their properties, including their sealing capacity; the latter offer smaller overall capacity, but with a reduced risk due to better reservoir knowledge. Gas reservoirs have also provided a proven seal to pressurized gas. However, reusing depleted O&amp;G reservoirs presents challenges that must be considered in the evaluation of performance factors and the risks associated Depletion can cause pore collapse in the reservoir - with an associated loss of capacity and injectivity - weaken caprock and bounding faults, or even well completions, leading to possible containment losses due to mechanical failure. O&amp;G reservoirs are also intersected by many wells and it is likely that stricter regulatory requirements on well integrity and the quality of zonal isolation will force operators to recomplete or work over wells which will be exposed to CO2, with an obvious impact on cost. Low reservoir pressure may also mean that injection of CO2 in a dense phase would result in reservoir fracturing and very strong thermal effects that may lead to injectivity problems. In the reservoir, chemical and physical differences in behavior between CO2 and methane may adversely affect geological containment and injectivity. Economics and financing present another set of constraints: use of injected CO2 for EOR/EGR vs. storage may lead to difficulties in obtaining emission credits. Infrastructure decommissioning and conflict with resource exploitation may reduce the attractiveness of depleted reservoirs. The benefits and challenges of depleted O&amp;G reservoirs will be analyzed with respect to all performance factors (capacity, injectivity, containment) and the major drivers of costs and risks will be identified. Fixed costs and risks, associated to uncertain capacity for deep saline formations or uncertain containment for depleted reservoirs, will then be used to compare the two candidates for CO2 geological storage and the paper will propose criteria to aid in the selection of possible storage sites.

TI  - Ship Main Engine Waste Heat Recovery for an Efficient Energy Management
AB  - The main engine internal combustion and friction of moving parts generate great amount of heat. This heat should be maintained within maker temperature thresholds. This is ensured by main engine fresh water-cooling system which circulate the fresh water in a closed loop and which is cooled in its turn by the seawater cooling system, using seawater as cooling fluid media. Then the hot seawater is thrown overboard ship. The heat generated by friction of the moving parts is absorbed by the lubricating oil system. This cooling process represent a great heat loss that is originally produced by consumption of fuel oil. This leads to the increase of fuel consumption and production of greenhouse gases. This paper proposes one of the design measures, to recover the waste heat, by using the hot main engine fresh water outlet for the heating of the accommodation sanitary water and quantifies the reduction of the greenhouse gases resulting in, for and efficient energy management and to comply with international maritime organization ship energy efficiency plan requirements.

TI  - Climate benefits of proposed carbon dioxide mitigation strategies for international shipping and aviation
AB  - While individual countries work to achieve and strengthen their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement, the growing emissions from two economic sectors remain largely outside most countries' NDCs: international shipping and international aviation. Reducing emissions from these sectors is particularly challenging because the adoption of any policies and targets requires the agreement of a large number of countries. However, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have recently announced strategies to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from their respective sectors. Here we provide information on the climate benefits of these proposed measures, along with related potential measures. Given that the global average temperature has already risen 1 degrees C above preindustrial levels, there is only 1.0 or 0.5 degrees C of additional ``allowable warming{''} left to stabilize below the 2 or 1.5 degrees C thresholds, respectively. We find that if no actions are taken, CO2 emissions from international shipping and aviation may contribute roughly equally to an additional combined 0.12 degrees C to global temperature rise by end of century - which is 12 \% and 24 \% of the allowable warming we have left to stay below the 2 or 1.5 degrees C thresholds (1.0 and 0.5 degrees C), respectively. However, stringent mitigation measures may avoid over 85 \% of this projected future warming from the CO2 emissions from each sector. Quantifying the climate benefits of proposed mitigation pathways is critical as international organizations work to develop and meet long-term targets.

TI  - Effects of hydrogen-rich products from methanol steam reforming on the performance enhancement of a medium-speed marine engine
AB  - In order to improve the heat utilization of exhaust gas from the small and medium-sized ships without exhaust boilers, a methanol steam reforming (MSR) is proposed in the study. The combustion model of marine engine blended hydrogen-rich reforming gas was developed, and verified in terms of cylinder pressure, BSFC, and NO emissions. The compositions of reforming gas were obtained by the MSR model and employed to investigate the effect of reforming gas at different blending ratios on the combustion and emission characteristics of the marine diesel engine in the AVL-Fire environment. The results obtained show that the performance, emission, and economic characteristics are improved due to the existence of reforming gas. Specifically, the indicated power is decreased by 0.5%â€“4.26% and the NO mass fraction is reduced by 2.95%â€“18.25% at different loads, but the CO mass fractions increased by 20.21%â€“54.73%. Similarly, the NOx weighted emission is reduced by 34.10%, which is close to the NOx emission limit of Tier II, but the CO weighted emission is increased by 30.89%. In addition, the equivalent fuel consumption rate is reduced by 0.45%â€“3.59% at the maximum blending ratio, and the converted fuel cost is reduced by 6%â€“10% at medium and high loads. Finally, based on the comprehensive performance analysis, the optimized blending ratio at each load is obtained as follows: Rg7.5 or Rg12.5 for 100% load, Rg10 for 75% load, Rg7.5 for 50% load, and Rg2.5 for 25% load. Thus, the MSR reaction is feasible to improve the energy efficiency and reduce NOx emission of the marine engine. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Carbon stocks in artificially and naturally regenerated mangrove ecosystems in the Mekong Delta
AB  - Mangrove forests cover a small fraction of the earthâ€™s surface, but contribute disproportionately to ecosystem services, including carbon (C) storage. These forests are being rapidly degraded as demand for economic development grows. In recognition of the multiple benefits of mangrove forests, rehabilitation of degraded forests is being carried out in many regions. This study assesses the potential for restored mangrove forests in Vietnam to sequester and store C, by characterizing two different mangrove restoration areas in the Mekong Delta region. The Can Gio Mangrove Biospheres Reserve (CGMBR) in Ho Chi Minh City was highly degraded during the Vietnam War and was subsequently replanted between 1978 and 1998. The Kien Vang Protection Forest (KVPF) in Ca Mau Province was similarly degraded during the war, but unlike CGMBR, it has experienced natural regeneration over the last 35Â years. We find that vegetation structure between two sites are not different significantly, though CGMBR has richer mangrove species diversity than KVPF. The mean of total ecosystem C stocks in planted mangroves of CGMBR (889Â Â±Â 111Â MgCÂ haâˆ’1) is not significantly different compare to natural regeneration forests of KVPF (844Â Â±Â 58 MgCÂ haâˆ’1). Our findings suggest that after 35Â years, both anthropogenically and naturally regenerated mangroves appear to store similar levels of C. Â© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Nickel nanoparticle-revolutionizing the way of carbon capture & storage
AB  - Storing CO2 in geologic strata, over a long period of time, includes three mechanisms of capillary trapping, dissolution trapping, and mineralization. Due to its low density and viscosity mobile CO2 will rise in the geological strata and also the current estimations suggest that it will take more than 1000 years for CO2 to permanently trap in the formation as a result of solubilization or mineral trapping. It is a key concern for CO2 storage, since sequestered CO2 will potentially rise through the geologic strata and be emitted back into the atmosphere. Here we propose a new strategy for carbon storage where CO2 is injected and bubbled through water in an ongoing operating reaction vessel after emplacement of Nickel nanoparticles which converts gaseous CO2 into carbonates. What nickel nanoparticles do is accelerate the natural conversion of CO2 to carbonic acid. The catalytic activity of the Nickel is pH independent and as they are water insoluble and magnetic so they can be magnetically separated for reuse. And the most important advantage of this technique is that, CO2 does not require to be monitored because it is present in the solid carbonate form whereas in the conventional method the concentrated CO2 is compressed into liquid and piped underground which has to be looked after for leakage. Turning CO2 gas into a solid that is stable over geological time will be economical. Buildings can be constructed using the carbonate, it can be dumped into the large holes, whatever, but after that it can be ignored. The CO2 will not be able to escape and no one has to pay attention to it. Copyright Â© (2015) by the Offshore Technology Conference All rights reserved.

TI  - Design of Fin Stabilizers Control System with Optimal Added Resistance
AB  - Large roll motion induced by sea waves can severely affect the performance of seagoing surface vessels. In the meanwhile, the ship speed will loss due to added resistance caused by ship motions, especially in moderate to high sea states. In addition, with increasing needs for energy savings and emissions reduction, the effect of added resistance on ship navigation performance and control quality must be considered when a ship roll stabilisation control system is designed. Therefore an alternative Roll-Added-Resistance (RAR) model is introduced to solve this problem base on the near field method. The software ANSYS-AQWA is chose to determine model parameters. As an application, fin stabilizers system is activated with a generalised minimum variance (GMV) controller. Two kinds of reference signals are adopted to investigate the effectiveness of this idea.

TI  - Asia's Largest Lignite Based Power Plant's Success Story: Efficient Removal of SO2 Through A Manmade Forest Canopy
AB  - One of the crucial issues that confronted world leaders in the recently concluded Copenhagen summit was that of achieving sufficient power generation for developing countries without exacerbating the problem of global warming. Developing countries, like India, are poised on the path of massive infrastructural project development still requiring power from conventional sources. Power generation at the point of origin of a particular natural resource such as lignite will still continue for some decades to come. The district of Tamil Nadu in South India is rich in lignite. Hence, it is quite natural that the Ministry of Coals, Government of India, should generate power from this rich natural resource at Neyveli Lignite Corporation (N.L.C.). In fact, N.L.C. is indeed Asia's largest lignite based power plant. The generation of power however comes with a price this involves the release of large quantities of SO2, which should be removed effectively. The dry deposition of sulphur dioxide over forested canopies is a subject of intense new research. Ours is a first study over coastal Tamil Nadu in the Indian subcontinent. In this case study, it is shown through fluid mechanical models, how SO2 pollution emanating from stacks is removed effectively by a hand planted, manmade, forest canopy. This power plant is situated in a hot humid tropical belt, giving one the meteorological advantage of a suitable micro-climate for the proliferation of lush green vegetation in a short span of time. N.L.C.'s astonishing success story really rests on the fact that the founding fathers planted 17 million trees within the complex which acts as an efficient sink for SO2 capture. Deposition velocity of SO2 is determined for a particular month, April, where the effects of wet scavenging are nonexistent. Particular emphasis is placed on various resistances including stomatal, mesophyllic, upper canopy, and buoyant convection resistances which are simulated using actual data from N.L.C., during April. Canopy resistance values are determined to be 158.87 and 124.45 s.m(-1) at 8:30 a.m. and at 2:30 p.m. respectively. The respective deposition velocities at those times are calculated to be 0.55 and 0.73 cm.s(-1).

TI  - Dwarf eelgrass (Zostera noltii) fatty acid remodelling induced by climate change
AB  - Dwarf eelgrass Zostera noltii meadows are found in estuarine coastal areas across the north-eastern Atlantic, where they provide key ecosystem services, including nursery grounds, sediment stabilization, nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration. These blue carbon ecosystems are being subjected to several anthropogenic pressures, including climate change-related effects. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical changes (fatty acid profiling) under different climate change scenarios (present-day conditions, ocean acidification, ocean warming and combined warming and acidification), following IPCC RCP scenario 8.5. Significant modifications in the percentage of saturated (SFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in response to warming and low pH levels were detected. The changes suggest a rearrangement of membrane composition to maintain membrane fluidity, especially under warming conditions. Individuals under warming treatment showed higher plastidial pathway activity, while acidification induced a shift in the fatty acid synthesis pathway towards the extraplastidial pathway, indicating a need to readjust the chloroplastidial monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) lipids under thermal stress to counteract excessive membrane fluidity. Regarding PUFA fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3, n-3) showed a pronounced decrease under the combined treatment, a tendency that can be connected to reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching and membrane remodelling. Thus, and observing the changes in the fatty acid profile, these essential molecules appear as good candidate biomarkers to detect changes in seagrass ecophysiology under acute climate change-related events. Our findings suggest that future global warming will pose a serious threat to these already endangered blue ecosystems.

TI  - Dissolution rate of liquid CO2 in pressurized water flows and the effect of clathrate films
AB  - The dissolution rate of liquid in CO2 in seawater, when a CO2 clathrate-hydrate film exists at the interface, is a key factor for estimation of CO2 sequestration in ocean and marine environmental impact assessment. Liquid CO2 dissolution phenomena in CO2 sequestration in the ocean include (i) dissolution and diffusion of liquid CO2 droplets at intermediate sea depths and (ii) CO2 dissolution in undercurrent flows from a liquid CO2 pool at seabeds deeper than 3000 m. For the first case, the present paper presents a data base of clathrate hydrate covered CO2 droplet surface concentration, which is essential for an analysis of CO2 droplet dissolution behavior. Effects of pressure and temperature are included. A numerical simulation for dissolving liquid CO2 droplets released at an intermediate ocean depth is presented. The effects of released droplet size and ambient CO2 concentration on dissolution behavior are clarified. For the second case, an experiment simulating dissolution of liquid CO2 stored at a seabed into an undercurrent flow was conducted. The pool surface was covered with clathrate and the surface concentration of the clathrate-covered CO2 pool was estimated. Applying the measured surface concentration and mass transfer coefficient obtained from the actual conditions of deep ocean data, the lime scale of CO2 dissolution into an undercurrent flow was estimated, which is important for estimation of CO2 disposal in the deep ocean.

TI  - Customer and design engineer interaction process enhances drilling efficiency for the operator in Offshore Malaysia
AB  - In general, the formation in offshore East Malaysia is more challenging than the formation in offshore West Malaysia. One reason is primarily because of the highly interbedded soft and hard formation throughout the well. What is even more challenging is the nature of polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) cutters, which are prone to breakingbecause of the impact from those highly interbedded formations. Field T is a fieldwithin the area that is well known for using a significant amount of drill bits to drill a well. Most PDC bits exhibited bad dulls and cutting structure conditions, particularly in the shoulder area. Broken and chipped cutters have resulted in the bits being pulled out of hole prematurely, unable to continue drilling to well total depth (TD). In the early days during the exploration phase, the PDC bits used in this field ended up mostly with ring out (RO) dulls regardless of the number of blades being used. This bad dull condition improved significantly during Phase 1A development drilling in Field T compared to drilling during exploration. However, it has being recognized that further improvements could still be made during Phase 1B development drilling in terms of rate of penetration (ROP) without compromising bit durability. To address the challenge, the approach should be a different bit design modifications rather than just a taking an off-the-shelf bit.Collaboration between the drilling project team and drill bit design engineers began months before the project was scheduled to start. This began the continuous interaction process between both parties to enhance drilling efficiency for the operator. After several meetings, discussions and presentations, the drilling project team and drill bit design engineers developed the optimum bit design solution for this application. Several design iterations were performed to obtain the most efficient cutting structure layout before finalizing and manufacturing the bit specifically designed for this field T. As a result, the entire 8.5 inch section was drilled using one specifically designed bit with an outstanding rate of penetration improvement, which was the objective of the 8.5 inch holesection. The successful result reflects a great team effort attained by thorough planning and execution process by both drilling project team and drill bit design engineers.

TI  - CO2 storage in deltaic saline aquifers: Invasion percolation and compositional simulation
AB  - Storage of large amounts of CO2 within deep underground aquifers has great potential for long-term mitigation of climate change. The U.S. Gulf Coast is an attractive target for CO2 storage because of the favorable formation properties for injection and containment of CO2. Deltaic formations are one of the primary targeted depositional environments in the Gulf Coast. This paper investigates CO2 storage in deltaic saline aquifers through a combination of geological modeling and flow simulation. The geological model in our study is developed based on a laboratory-scale 3D flume experiment replicating the formation of a delta structure and populated with geologic properties according to Miocene Gulf of Mexico natural analogues. We used invasion percolation simulations to understand the gravity-driven flow and the relationship between architecture, stratigraphy, and fluid migration pathways. The results were used to develop an upscaled model for compositional simulation with the key features of the original geological model and to determine injection schemes that maximize the injection capacity and minimize the amount of mobile CO2 in the formation. In order to achieve this, we used compositional reservoir simulations to study the pressure-driven flow and phase behavior. The results of invasion percolation simulations were used to identify the key stratigraphic units affecting CO2 migration. The realistic geometries and high resolution of the model facilitate the transfer of results from synthetic to subsurface data. The results allow for the analysis of deltaic depositional environments, important stratigraphic surfaces, and their impact on CO2 storage. The reservoir simulation model and phase behavior were validated against available field and lab data. The results of reservoir simulations were used to investigate the effects of main mechanisms, such as gas trapping and solubilization, on storage capacity. We compared our simulation results on the basis of invasion percolation (gravity driven) and reservoir simulation (pressure driven). The comparison is helpful to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and determine best practices to evaluate CO2 migration within similar formations. The unique and extremely well characterized deltaic model allows for unprecedented representation of the depositional aquifer architecture. This research combines geologic modeling, flow simulation, and application for CO2 storage. The integrated conclusions will constrain predictions of actual subsurface flow performance and CO2 storage capacity in deltaic systems, while identifying potential risks and primary stratigraphic migration pathways. This research gives insights on prediction of CO2 storage performance and characterization of prospective saline aquifers. Copyright 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Application of blue led light to prevent barnacle larval settlement
AB  - The economical operation of ships involves reducing fuel consumption while operating under secure navigation. Reducing fuel consumption is closely related to preventing biofouling on a shipâ€™s bottom because growing fouling organisms increase the frictional drag and reduce the shipâ€™s speed. Economical operation obviously contributes to the sustainable development of transport by ships and the prevention of global warming. In addition, preventing invasion by exotic fouling organisms via ships is important for maintaining the conservation of bio-diversity. We examined the usefulness of blue LED light for preventing barnacle larval settlement. Settlement was inhibited when cyprids, which were collected from seawater and suspended in a tub, were exposed to blue LED light with a maximum irradiation intensity of 293.6 W m-2. However, cyprids gathered and settled on the bottom of the tub when maximum irradiation intensities of blue LED light, 71.6 W m-2, or amber LED light, 185.6 W m-2, were reached. The insertion of darkness periods of less than 30 seconds was acceptable for keeping the prevention effect of a relatively strong blue LED light, indicating that energy can be saved in actual use against hull fouling. As for the field experiments, an adhesion plate, which corresponds to a hull bottom, was immersed 40.0 cm from the light source composed of blue (36 pieces) and amber LEDs (36 pieces). The number of cyprids settling on the adhesion plate was reduced by 23% in comparison with that in continuous darkness when the light source with a maximum blue irradiation intensity of 558.6 W m-2 was illuminated for 10 seconds following the illumination of amber LEDs with a maximum intensity of 34.8 W m-2 for 30 seconds repeatedly throughout the experiment. In the experiment, the maximum intensity of blue light reaching the adhesion plate was estimated to be 27.9 W m-2. These results indicate that using blue LEDs as a light source with the maximum irradiation intensity of more than 500 W m-2 alone is a novel method of preventing hull fouling of a ship at anchor, drifting, and at ports of call.

TI  - An evaluation of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) baseline for tankers, containerships, and LNG carriers
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is developing the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) for new ships, which is a gauge of a ship's CO 2 design efficiency. By evaluating the baselines for tankers, LNG carriers, and containerships utilizing the "standard" ships, this study provides the attained EEDI that can be achieved with well-designed newbuildings prior to application of innovative technologies. As such, they serve as an effective metric for validating the proposed EEDI baselines. This paper summarizes the findings from this study, which were submitted to SNAME T&amp;R Ad Hoc Panel 18 tasked with investigating the EEDI. This paper, originally presented at SNAME's symposium on "Climate Change and Ships" in February, 2010, was revised in June of 2011 to reflect changes to the EEDI methodology contained in MEPC 61/5/3 and the baseline calculations contained in MEPC 62/6/4.

TI  - Causes and effects of mangrove ecosystem damage on carbon stocks and absorption in East Java, Indonesia
AB  - The mangrove ecosystems in East Java are widely exploited and converted for other land. Mangrove forests help decrease carbon dioxide concentration, are very efficient carbon sinks and store them in large quantities in biomass and sediments for a long time. This paper tries to understand the causes and effects of mangroves ecosystem damage on carbon stocks and absorption, with East Java, Indonesia as a case study. The Driver, Pressure, State, Impact and Response (DPSIR) framework, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Partial Least Squares (PLS) used to identify and solve these problems. The result shows that the destruction of mangrove forests in East Java has occurred due to land conversion intensification. Accordingly, the mangrovesâ€™ average carbon sequestration and storage in East Java can be classified as moderate to low. Illegal logging is the leading cause, so there needs to be a clear policy that involves the government and the community. This result suggests that forming a strategy to prevent illegal logging and increase carbon sequestration and storage must be carried out, and community engagement in decision-making processes to protect and manage the mangrove forests.
