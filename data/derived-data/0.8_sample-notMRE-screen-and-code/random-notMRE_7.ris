TI  - Nuclear fuel considerations for the 21st century
AB  - There are many external influences that may control the path that nuclear power deployment follows. In the next 50 years several events may unfold. Fear of the consequences of the greenhouse effect may produce a carbon tax that would make nuclear power economically superior very quickly. This, in turn, would increase the rate at which uranium reserves diminish due to the increased rate of nuclear power deployment. However, breakthroughs in the extraction of uranium from the sea of deployment of fast breeder reactors would greatly extend the uranium reserves and, as well, utilize the thorium cycle. On the other hand, carbon sequestering technology breakthroughs could keep fossil fuels dominant for the remainder of the century. Nuclear power may only then continue, as today, in a lesser role or even diminish. Fusion power or new developments in solar power could completely displace nuclear power as we know it today. Even more difficult to predict is when the demand for mobile fuel for transportation will develop such that hydrogen and hydrogen rich fuel cells will be in common use. When this happens, nuclear power may be the energy source of choice to produce this fuel from water or methane. In a similar vein, the demand for potable and irrigation water may be another driver for the advent of increased deployment of nuclear power. With all these possibilities of events that could happen it appears impossible to predict with any certainty which path nuclear power deployment may take. However, it is necessary to define a strategy that is flexible enough to insure that when a technology is needed, it is ready to be deployed. For the next few decades there will be an evolutionary improvement in the performance of uranium oxide and mixed uranium oxide-plutonium oxide (MOX) LWR fuels. These improvements will be market driven to keep the cost of fuel and the resulting cost of nuclear power electricity as competitive as possible. The development of fuels for accelerator transmutation and for reactor transmutation with inert matrix fuels is in its infancy. A great deal of research has been initiated in a number of countries, which has been summarized in recent conferences. In Europe the work on these fuels is directed at the same problem as their utilization of MOX; namely to reduce the inventory of separated plutonium, minor actinides, and Long Lived Fission Products (LLFP). In the United States there is no reprocessing and thus no inventory of separated civilian plutonium. However, in the United States there is a resistance to a permanent spent fuel repository and thus accelerator transmutation presents a possible alternative. If nuclear power does have a long-term future, then the introduction of the fast reactor is inevitable. Included in the mission of the fast reactors would be the elimination of the inventory of separated plutonium while generating useful energy. The work that is ongoing now on the development of fuel concepts for assemblies that, contain actinides and LLFP would be useful for fast reactor transmutation. There is still a great deal of work required to bring the fast breeder reactor option to maturity. Fortunately there is perhaps a fifty-year period to accomplish this work before fast breeders are necessary. With regard to fast reactor fuel development, future work should be considered in three stages. First, all the information obtained over the past forty years of fast reactor fuel development should be completely documented in a manner that future generations can readily retrieve and utilize the information. Fast reactor development came to such an abrupt halt world-wide that a great deal of information is in danger of being lost because most of the researchers and facilities are rapidly disappearing. Secondly, for all of the existing fast reactor fuels, and this includes, oxides, carbides, nitrides, and metallic fuels, the evolutionary work was far from being completed. Although mixed oxide fuels were probably the furthest advanced, there were many concepts for improved claddings and advanced fabrication methods that were never fully explored. Finally, with such an extended period before fast reactors are needed there is ample time for truly innovative fuels to be developed that are capable of performing over a wide range of conditions and coolants.

TI  - Sustainable activated carbons of macroalgae waste from the Agar-Agar industry. Prospects as adsorbent for gas storage at high pressures
AB  - CO2 capture with solid sorbents is one of the most promising options for reducing the consequences of climate change when large amounts of CO2 are emitted into the atmosphere. The present study explores the possible use of macroalgae industrial waste, algae meal (AM), and its carbonised (AMP) to prepare activated carbons by means of MOH and K2CO3 activation in two different devices (an electrical conventional and a multimode microwave furnace) for CO2 capture and for the separation or concentration of gas mixtures. The adsorbents obtained, at 750 degrees C, with a low weight ratio of KOH:AM (0.5:1), show in most cases a high specific surface area-BET (up to 1982 m(2)/g). These materials are mainly microporous (Vmicropore > 80\%) with a certain degree of mesoporosity and contain a significant amount of nitrogen. The adsorbents were subjected to a CO2, CH4 and H-2 adsorption process at high pressure, showing a better selectivity towards CO2, than towards CH4 and H-2. This suggests they could be used for capturing CO2 in pre-combustion processes or separating/concentrating mixtures of CO2/CH4 in natural gas feeds for use as fossil fuel. Some of the adsorbents proved to be more effective in adsorbing CO2 than one of the commercial activated carbons used as reference (Chemviron Filtrasorb F400). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Delivery of Nigeria's first brownfield deepwater triple daisy chained subsea system
AB  - SNEPCo's Bonga North West (BNW) Project has successfully installed and commissioned the Gulf of Guinea's first brownfield deepwater triple manifold daisy chain system, integrating two different subsea Vendor's production and water injection systems in a unique achievement. Two new-build 90Te 4-slot subsea manifolds were connected to an existing end-of-line Bonga Main 4-slot production manifold via a retrofit Cross Over Module (COM), using a series of pipe-in-pipe flowlines and sleds. This paper will describe the technical and organizational enablers that were identified, developed and implemented to successfully achieve this complex task in over 1000 m water depth offshore Nigeria. Integration of the two new subsea production manifolds to the existing subsea system was achieved via the COM. In principle, the design of the COM is a dual header fixed hub system that bridges the new subsea infrastructure to the existing manifold, originally proposed to enable concurrent operations and new field tie-in. The COM is equipped with an isolation arrangement giving double isolation to each of the dual headers, to enable continued Bonga Main production after COM installation and prior to completion of other BNW facilities. This decoupled and de-risked the short COM installation operation from the lengthy BNW facilities installation phase, giving schedule flexibility, and minimum production deferment. Removal of the selected Bonga Main Pigging Loop Module (PLM), located at all end manifolds, was required without hydrocarbon leakage to the environment. Various options for displacing stabilized flowline hydrocarbons present within existing flowlines, necessary for replacement of the PLM by the COM, were considered. Treated produced water available on the Bonga Main FPSO to flush the flow loop was selected for the displacement process, and was readily achieved by re-directing produced water into a dedicated clean slop tank on the FPSO. Displacement (de-oiling) of the production flowlines using this method enabled the regulatory water quality requirement of 30ppm required for discharge into the environment to be met. Good collaboration between various specialized teams in the replacement of the PLM with the COM, covering Operations, Intervention, Subsea Surveillance, Flow Assurance and Subsurface, was critical to the overall delivery success of the project. Integration of BNW subsea hardware and flowlines with existing Bonga Main subsea infrastructure was completed safely and seamlessly to give first oil on time and with minimal disruption to existing production. New flow assurance challenges associated with the triple manifold daisy chain system were observed during early operation and will be discussed further herein. Significant insights and learnings were gained regarding in-country fabrication, specifically concerning onsite dimensional control and achievement of fabrication tolerances.

TI  - Time-lapse analysis of pressure transients due to ocean tides for estimating CO2 saturation changes
AB  - This study proposed and examined a practical technique for analysing CO2 storage responses using offshore pressure transients affected by the ocean tide. The gravitational attractions of the solar-system bodies cause ocean tides, and the pore pressure exhibits diurnal and semidiurnal fluctuations in response to such tidal phenomena. The pressure-fluctuation amplitude is related to the loading efficiency, which is a function of reservoir elastic properties and fluid saturations. Therefore, the loading efficiency can be used to estimate the in situ pore compressibility and the CO2 saturation. Applying the tidal-signal analysis in a time-lapse manner, one may see temporal changes in CO2 saturation and consequently describe the dynamic behavior of sequestered CO2. In the analysis at the offshore CO2 storage site in Tomakomai, Japan, a temporal decrease in CO2 saturation was detected during the shut-in period, which is caused primarily by CO2 migration away from the well. The proposed methodology essentially requires only continuous pressure data, which are routinely available during CO2 storage operations, and thus, can be a cost-effective and labour-saving monitoring technique.

TI  - CO2 and CH4 emissions from coastal wetland soils
AB  - Increasing awareness of the significance of coastal wetlands in global carbon budgets, combined with recently developed approaches such as in situ gas analyzers connected to flux chambers, has led to the wide interests in quantifying greenhouse gas exchange in these ecosystems, for which less attention was paid to than terrestrial ecosystems. Considering the high net primary production and large carbon stocks of coastal wetlands, recent researches have pointed out their conservation as an opportunity to mitigate climate change. CO2 emissions are especially low in mangrove ecosystems (257gCmâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1), while CO2 emissions from saltmarshes (564gCmâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1) are relatively similar to those from terrestrial ecosystems (592gCmâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1). Contrasting trends were reported for CH4 emissions, with low values in terrestrial ecosystems (0.22gCmâˆ’2 yearâˆ’1), intermediate values in mangroves (1.69gCmâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1), and high values in saltmarshes (14.2gCmâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1). The large variability in measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes at the soil-air interface suggests that emissions are highly responsive to changes in both physical and biological parameters. Anthropogenic disturbances in particular often enhance carbon decomposition and releases from soils. With a focus on coastal wetlands, this chapter gives recommendations for the use of incubation chambers, synthesizes soil-air CO2 and CH4 flux magnitudes, discusses the biotic and abiotic parameters influencing greenhouse gas fluxes, and provides future directions to fill the knowledge gaps in coastal carbon budget estimates.

TI  - Assessing the potential of using biochar in mine rehabilitation under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration
AB  - Purpose Re-establishment of soil nitrogen (N) capital is a priority in mine rehabilitation. We aimed to evaluate the effects of biochar addition on improving mine spoil N pools and the influence of elevated CO2 concentration on mine rehabilitation. Materials and methods We assessed the effects of pinewood biochar, produced at three temperatures (650, 750 and 850 degrees C, referred as B-650, B-750 and B-850, respectively), on mine spoil total N concentrations with five different plant species, including a tree species (Eucalyptus crebra), N-fixing shrubs (Acacia floribunda and Allocasuarina littoralis) and C-3 and C-4 grasses (Austrodanthonia tenuior and Themeda australis) incubated at ambient (400 mu L L-1) and elevated (700 mu L L-1) atmospheric CO2 concentrations, as well as the effects of elevated CO2 on mine rehabilitation. Results and discussion Soil total N significantly improved following biochar incorporation under all plant species (P < 0.05) except for T. Australis. E. crebra had the highest soil total N (0.197\%, 0.198\% and 0.212\% for B650, B750 and B850, respectively). Different from the negligible influence of elevated CO2 on soil properties under the grasses and the Nfixing shrubs, elevated CO2 significantly increased soil water and hot water extractable organic C (WEOC and HWEOC, respectively) and decreased total C under E. crebra, indicating that the nutrient demands were not met. Conclusions Biochar addition showed the potential in mine rehabilitation in terms of improving soil N pool, especially with E. crebra. However, it would be more difficulty to rehabilitate mine spoils in future with the rising atmospheric CO2 concentration.

TI  - Ocean Alkalinity, Buffering and Biogeochemical Processes
AB  - Alkalinity, the excess of proton acceptors over donors, plays a major role in ocean chemistry, in buffering and in calcium carbonate precipitation and dissolution. Understanding alkalinity dynamics is pivotal to quantify ocean carbon dioxide uptake during times of global change. Here we review ocean alkalinity and its role in ocean buffering as well as the biogeochemical processes governing alkalinity and pH in the ocean. We show that it is important to distinguish between measurable titration alkalinity and charge balance alkalinity that is used to quantify calcification and carbonate dissolution and needed to understand the impact of biogeochemical processes on components of the carbon dioxide system. A general treatment of ocean buffering and quantification via sensitivity factors is presented and used to link existing buffer and sensitivity factors. The impact of individual biogeochemical processes on ocean alkalinity and pH is discussed and quantified using these sensitivity factors. Processes governing ocean alkalinity on longer time scales such as carbonate compensation, (reversed) silicate weathering, and anaerobic mineralization are discussed and used to derive a close-to-balance ocean alkalinity budget for the modern ocean.

TI  - The captive air amphibious transporter "CAATÂ®" an enabler for ultra-heavy lift amphibious logistic operations in extreme environments
AB  - The Captive Air Amphibious Transporter (CAAT Â®) is a new amphibious vehicle technology that enables heavy-lift, logistics transport at considerable speed over land, open water, shallow water, surf-zone, beach and mud-flats, and obstacles to potentially include sea ice. Unlike an air cushion vehicle, which uses lift fans and a "non-sealed" flexible skirt cushion to keep the craft afloat and propel it, the CAAT uses a "captive" or "sealed air cushion" in the form of a buoyant belt which translates around the vehicle providing both buoyancy and propulsion. This approach enables the CAAT to provide the lift capacity and versatility of a traditional Landing Craft Utility (LCU) while exceeding the amphibious mobility of a Landing Craft Air Cushion vehicle (LCAC). The CAAT's low ground pressure (less than 2 psi) supports environmentally sensitive ecosystems and enables it to traverse environments that would typically stop an equivalently-loaded tracked or wheeled vehicle (ground pressures of 15 to 20 psi). Of particular importance, the CAAT's method of propulsion eliminates collisions with floating debris or ice fields. For mobility in open-water cluttered with ice-fields, the CAAT's propulsion track system provides a zero knot relative speed to the water surface. This performance is unique to the CAAT technology and results in the CAAT essentially "walking-on-water" as opposed to plowing through it like a traditional marine craft. Additionally, the CAAT technology projects to offer a 30% improvement in operational cost ($/ton-nm) relative to an LCU and a 300% improvement relative to an LCAC. The CAAT technology affords the natural resource development industry a heavy-lift logistics amphibious transport capability that is compatible with environmentally sensitive coastal regions. For the arctic region in particular this will increase logistics transportation cost-effectiveness by eliminating the seasonal dependency of ice road infrastructure and respective environmental restoration.

TI  - Workflows and considerations for CO2 injection in a highly depleted gas field in the southern North Sea
AB  - Issues and associated mitigation measures for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) relating to capacity, injectivity and integrity of the storage site are not trivial. Modeling of CO2 injection along wellbores is still in its infancy compared with traditional hydrocarbon modeling. While a significant amount of work has been done with respect to modeling discrete components of the storage site and associated infrastructure, validation of our modeling tools and the results still remains uncertain, particularly with respect to two phase flow in the wellbore. This paper presents a workflow for injection of CO 2 into highly depleted gas fields, addressing the issues around injection modeling and the impact on surface facilities, well design and the near wellbore interface. These include: obtaining accurate predictions of phase behavior, density, and viscosity, determining the impact of delivery pressure and temperature versus reservoir conditions. Wellbore design issues such as sizing and load resistance of tubulars and metallurgy selection in order to ensure both injection performance and integrity must also be considered. Modeling CO2 in the reservoir is also discussed considering the near wellbore effects (cooling and potential ice / hydrate formation). Finally, short and long term monitoring issues are identified and the benefits and limitations of the various monitoring options are discussed. Copyright 2011, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Community interactions dampen acidification effects in a coastal plankton system
AB  - Changing seawater chemistry towards reduced pH as a result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is affecting oceanic organisms, particularly calcifying species. Responses of non-calcifying consumers are highly variable and mainly mediated through indirect ocean acidification effects induced by changing the biochemical content of their prey, as shown within single species and simple 2-trophic level systems. However, it can be expected that indirect CO2 impacts observed at the single species level are compensated at the ecosystem level by species richness and complex trophic interactions. A dampening of CO2-effects can be further expected for coastal communities adapted to strong natural fluctuations in pCO(2), typical for productive coastal habitats. Here we show that a plankton community of the Kiel Fjord was tolerant to CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) levels projected for the end of this century (<1400 mu atm), and only subtle differences were observed at the extremely high value of 4000 mu atm. We found similar phyto- and microzooplankton biomass and copepod abundance and egg production across all CO2 treatment levels. Stoichiometric phytoplankton food quality was minimally different at the highest pCO(2) treatment, but was far from being potentially limiting for copepods. These results are in contrast to studies that include only a single species, which observe strong indirect CO2 effects for herbivores and suggest limitations of biological responses at the level of organism to community. Although this coastal plankton community was highly tolerant to high fluctuations in pCO(2), increase in hypoxia and CO2 uptake by the ocean can aggravate acidification and may lead to pH changes outside the range presently experienced by coastal organisms.

TI  - Microbial fuel cells: A promising alternative energy source
AB  - The Indian sub-continent is luxuriously bestowed with all wealth in the form of population, land and ocean. Being placed as the second highly populated nation in the world, India is under the urge to nurture the needs of its population. Its various demands such as the demand for food, employment, economy, etc., can be completely resolved if the country is adequately supplied with energy. But adequate supplying of energy to such a vast population is quiet an impossible task, which demands seek for alternative energy sources. The widely known alternative energy sources are generally, renewable energy sources such as solar cells, fuel cells and wind power. At this moment, several fuel cell types based on hydrogen and methanol work appropriately, and applications already exist for, for example, portable computers. However, the question can be raised whether this energy generation is really sustainable. Furthermore, the customer may not like to carry hydrogen gas (even captured within a metal hydride matrix) or methanol. But, Microbial fuel cells can operate on a large variety of substrates that are readily available, even in any supermarket. Substrates such as plain sugar and starch are easy to store, contain more energy than any other feed type per unit of volume, and are easy to dose. Furthermore, they have a more â€˜greenâ€™ image than, for example, methanol. Moreover, MFCs can be developed that are environmentally friendly in terms of material composition. When microorganisms function as biocatalysts that motivate the degradation of organic materials to produce electrons, which travel via an electric circuit, then the fuel cell is termed as a microbial fuel cell. This chapter covers an introduction to MFCs, state of art of MFCs and wide applications of MFCs technology. If the development of MFCs leads to a product that has a reasonable (read: usable) power output per unit of MFC volume, it will be a viable product. A customer will accept a larger battery, and a larger feeding tank, provided the feeding is easy to perform and has a green and safe label. Â© 2016 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.

TI  - A model testing to improve punch-through failure assessment
AB  - The jack-up platform will face the risk of punch-through failure when pilling in areas where a stronger-thinner layered soil overlays a softer soil layer. The punch-through failure that occurred in the South China Sea indicates that there are still shortcomings in the existing punch-through failure assessment methods. Therefore, this paper improves the shortcomings of the existing punch-through failure assessment method based on the simulation experiment. Firstly, the shortcomings of the existing punch-through failure assessment method were analyzed based on the case of punch-through incidents occurred in the South China Sea. Then, the main factors of punch-through were analyzed by means of simulation experiment, and the shortcomings of the existing method were improved. Meanwhile, a punch-through failure assessment method considering the spudcan tip height and loading process was established. Finally, taking a case of the South China Sea as an example, the improved model guided the penetration of jack-up platform and avoided punch-through failure successfully. By analyzing the case of the punch-through failure occurred in the South China Sea, the soil layer in which punch-through failure occurs has the characteristics that the thickness of stronger-thinner layered soil is close to the height of pile tip. In order to explore the main factors leading to punch-through failure, a set of experimental system simulating the spudcan punch-through was designed, and a series of punch-through simulation experiments were conducted. Simulation experiment results show that the reduction ratio of bearing capacity will decreases with the ratio of stronger-thinner layered soil thickness and pile tip height (d/h) increases. When the d/h is greater than 2, the reduction ratio of bearing capacity is less than 5%; When the pile tip height is equal to the thickness of stronger-thinner layered soil, the reduction ratio of bearing capacity is more than 95%. The innovation of this paper is that punch-through failure assessment method considering ratio of pile tip height and soil layer thickness was established.

TI  - Energy-Saving Hydrogen Production by Seawater Electrolysis Coupling Sulfion Degradation
AB  - Electrolysis of costless and infinite seawater is a promising way toward grid-scale hydrogen production without causing freshwater stress. Practical potential of this technology, however, is hindered by low energy efficiency and anode corrosion by the detrimental chlorine chemistry in seawater in addition to unaffordable electricity expense. Herein, energy-saving hydrogen production is reported by chlorine-free seawater splitting coupling sulfion oxidation. It yields hydrogen at a low cell voltage of 0.97 V, cutting the electricity consumption to 2.32 kWh per m(3) H-2 at 300 mA cm(-2). Compared to alkaline water electrolysis, the energy expense is primarily saved by 60\% with 50\% lower energy equivalent input. Benefiting from the ultralow cell voltage, the hazardous chlorine chemistry is fully avoided without anode corrosion regardless of Cl- crossover. Meanwhile, it also allows fast degradation of S2- pollutant from the water body to value-added sulfur with 80\% efficiency, for further reducing hydrogen cost and protection of the ecosystem. Connecting such a hybrid seawater electrolyzer to a commercial solar cell can harvest the hydrogen from seawater with better sustainability. This work may offer new opportunities for low-cost hydrogen production from the unlimited ocean resources with environmental protection.

TI  - Prospects for Alternative Energy Sources in Global Energy Sector
AB  - The paper aims to reveal the prospects for the development of global energy sector and to look into the prospects for alternative energy sources in the world power industry. The paper provides the analysis of oil and gas (natural, liquefied, shale) production and transportation in the medium term. We define the conditions and the main factors of providing energy security as well as overcoming energy poverty of national economies. For the purpose of energy diversification, we identify the directions and the potential for the use of alternative energy sources and the possibility to step up development of alternative energy. On the basis of statistics, the paper demonstrates that the use of alternative fuels (hydrogen, biofuel, solar and wind energy, tidal energy) has not yet resulted in a significant decrease in the demand for oil, gas and other traditional energy sources. It is noted that offshore Arctic gas development is gradually increasing. Data on Arctic seas gas resources are provided.

TI  - Subsurface CO2 storage estimation in Bakken tight oil and Eagle Ford shale gas condensate reservoirs by retention mechanism
AB  - This paper describes the CO2 geological sequestration process in unconventional reservoirs in northern and southern United States such as Bakken tight oil and Eagle Ford shale gas condensate reservoirs. The hysteresis modelling and retention mechanism was performed in this research and this is one of the efficient and proven method to store CO2 in the subsurface. This can be achieved through CO2 EOR process while injecting CO2, the fluid will be trapped in the pore spaces between the impermeable rocks and oil can be recovered simultaneously. A total of four cases was taken for the analysis, such as the Bakken and Eagle Ford reservoirs with CO2 huff-n-puff process and another two cases with CO2 Flooding. Injection pressure, injection rate, injection time, number of cycles, carbon dioxide soaking time, fracture half-length, fracture conductivity, fracture spacing, porosity, permeability, and initial reservoir pressure as is taken as inputs and cumulative oil production, and oil recovery factor was taken as outputs. The reservoirs were modelled for 30 years of oil production and the factor year was taken as Decision Making Unit (DMU) and the models was calculated at each year. The retention was successfully calculated in all four models and percentage of retention above 90% was observed in all four cases and the injection pressure has the most dominating effect on the CO2 geological sequestration. It was also revealed that the CO2 huff-n-puff performance in Bakken reservoir is not that much more effective since the retention rate decreases during soaking period and flooding was found to be a suitable method in this formation. Even in Eagle Ford formation, the average performance of CO2 flooding process is better than the huff-n-puff, but the latter process was quite effective in this shale gas condensate reservoir.

TI  - Marine ecological habitat: A case study on projected thermal power plant around Dharamtar creek, India
AB  - Estuaries and tidal creeks, harboring mangroves particularly, face tremendous anthropogenic pressures. Expansion of mega cities and the thermal power plants are generally proposed in the vicinity of estuaries and creek, due to the feasibility of intake and discharge of water for cooling. Discharges from such developments remain constant threat of increasing thermal pollution and affecting the quality of environment. The baseline information on prevailing quality of aquatic environment comes handy for understanding alterations due to such activities. Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed that temperature, pH, salinity, suspended solids, DO, BOD and phaeophytins are major parameters influencing the creek system. Heated effluents may have direct and adverse impacts on these parameters, altering biotic constituents.

TI  - Hybrid Energy Storage Systems for Voltage Stabilization in Shipboard Microgrids
AB  - Due to increasing environmental concerns associated with the fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse emissions by marine vessels, world is moving towards sustainable energy resources such as solar, wind and so on. Renewable energy sources are found out to be a significant source of energy as they are sustainable and clean as compared to traditional generation sources, for instance, the burning of fossil fuels, diesel generators, steam engines, etc. As solar energy is one of the cheapest, abundant and cleanest source of energy, therefore, it has the potential to be the most utilized source of energy along with energy storage systems (ESS) for future yachts and ferries. However, partial shading effect and intermittent nature of photovoltaic (PV) systems cause fluctuations in voltage that can potentially disturb the voltage profile, therefore may instigate instability in shipboard microgrids, if not properly managed. This paper, therefore, proposes a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) comprising of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery and ultra-capacitor having the capability to mitigate fluctuations caused by the partial shading effect in PV panels. The control system is based on frequency sharing approach in which high-frequency components are handled by the ultra-capacitor whereas low-frequency components are handled by the Li-ion battery. The proposed methodology is simulated using MATLAB/ SINULINK and various scenarios of power sharing are highlighted for the validation of the proposed scheme. Â© 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Using isotope labeling to partition sources of CO2 efflux in newly established mangrove seedlings
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) flux is a critical component of the global C budget. While CO2 flux has been increasingly studied in mangroves, better partitioning of components contributing to the overall flux will be useful in constraining C budgets. Little information is available on how CO2 flux may vary with forest age and conditions. We used a combination of C-13 stable isotope labeling and closed chambers to partition CO2 efflux from the seedlings of the widespread mangrove Avicennia marina in laboratory microcosms, with a focus on sediment CO2 efflux in establishing forests. We showed that (1) above-ground part of plants were the chief component of overall CO2 efflux; and (2) the degradation of sediment organic matter was the major component of sediment CO2 efflux, followed by root respiration and litter decomposition, as determined using isotope mixing models. There was a significant relationship between C isotope values of CO2 released at the sediment-air interface and both root respiration and sediment organic matter decomposition. These relative contributions of different components to overall and sediment CO2 efflux can be used in partitioning of the sources of overall respiration and sediment C mineralization in establishing mangroves.

TI  - Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment (FOCE) experiments: Scientific and technical recommendations for future in situ ocean acidification projects
AB  - Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment (FOCE) experiments are a relatively recent development in ocean acidification research, designed to address the need for in situ, long-term, community level experiments. FOCE studies have been conducted across different marine benthic habitats and regions, from Antarctica to the tropics. Based on this previous research we have formed some core operating principles that will aid those embarking on future FOCE experiments. FOCE studies have potential to provide important insight into the effects of ocean acidification that can add to or refine conclusions drawn from laboratory or single species studies because they are conducted in situ on intact assemblages. Scaling up from sub-organismal and individual effects to also include indirect impacts on the ecosystem and ecosystem services, make FOCE experiments essential in filling in current knowledge gaps in our understanding of ocean acidification. While FOCE systems are complex, relatively costly, and somewhat difficult to operate, the challenges they pose are tractable and they have proven to be a useful approach in ocean acidification research. The aim of this paper is to draw from the experiences of past FOCE experiments and provide practical advice for designing, building and operating a FOCE experiment. Some of the most important recommendations include: field testing the system design; having a backup power supply; using replicate treatment enclosures; monitoring and maintaining the chemistry appropriately; allowing sufficient time to achieve near CO2 equilibrium conditions; and having a scientific focus with a core set of hypotheses. Future FOCE experiments could focus on longer durations, multiple factors, and testing more intact benthic marine communities and ecosystems. We hope this paper will encourage further FOCE deployments and experiments, as well as provide some guidelines to improve future FOCE studies and advance ocean acidification research.

TI  - Climate change mitigation effects: How do potential CO2 leaks from a sub-seabed storage site in the Norwegian Sea affect Astarte sp. bivalves?
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the most promising mitigation strategies for reducing the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere and may substantially help to decelerate global warming. There is an increasing demand for CCS sites. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge of the environmental risk associated with potential leakage of CO2 from the storage sites; and even more, what happens when the seepage stops. Can the environment return to the initial equilibrium? Potential effects on native macrofauna were studied under a scenario of a 50-day CO2 leakage, and the subsequent leak closure. To accomplish the objective, Trondheim Fjord sediments and clams were exposed to an acidified environment (pH 6.9) at 29 atm for 7 weeks followed by a 14-day recovery at normal seawater conditions (pH 8.0, 29 atm). Growth and survival of clams exposed to pressure (29 atm) and reduced pH (6.9) did not significantly differ from control clams kept at 1 atm in natural seawater. Furthermore, bioaccumulation of elements in the soft tissue of clams did not register significant variations for most of the analysed elements (Cd, Cr, Pb, and Ti), while other elements (As, Cu, Fe, Ni) had decreasing concentrations in tissues under acidified conditions in contrast to Na and Mg, which registered an uptake (Ku) of 111 and 9.92 Î¼g gâˆ’1dw dâˆ’1, respectively. This Ku may be altered due to the stress induced by acidification; and the element concentration being released from sediments was not highly affected at that pH. Therefore, a 1 unit drop in pH at the seafloor for several weeks does not appear to pose a risk for the clams. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The Impact of Electrification on Power System in Northern Europe
AB  - Electrification is widely considered as a viable strategy for reducing the negative environmental impacts of the energy system. Following this strategy, most attention has been paid to electrification of road transportation, i.e., electric vehicles. In addition, substantial potentials could be exploited in the electrification of offshore oil and gas platforms, as an alternative to on-site gas turbines. In our research, we focus on electrification of the offshore oil and gas installations in the Norwegian continental shelf. We apply a net transfer capacity (NTC) based power market model to analyse the economic consequence of the Norwegian offshore platforms electrification on six Northern European countries. The power market model comprises Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands. The objective of the optimisation model is to minimize the operating cost of the power system over the lifetime of the oil and gas offshore platform considered for electrification. The operating cost comprises the sum of fuel cost, start-up cost, and carbon emission cost for all generators. We analysed three scenarios for electrification and carbon prices, and we assumed a development path of wind and solar power that is in line with EU climate policy up to 2050. Firstly, we investigate the power system performance without considering environmental taxes. Secondly, we incorporate the carbon emission cost into the optimisation model to analyse how this affects the production mix in simulated countries. Finally, we introduce the electrification of offshore platforms in Norway into our model to calculate the marginal costs and emissions associated with the increased power consumption. The lifetime for the North Sea offshore platforms' electrification in our research is assumed to be up to the year 2058.

TI  - Thermodynamic performance comparison of various energy storage systems from source-to-electricity for renewable energy resources
AB  - This study discusses and thermodynamically analyzes several energy storage systems, namely; pumped-hydro, compressed air, hot water storage, molten salt thermal storage, hydrogen, ammonia, lithium-ion battery, Zn-air battery, redox flow battery, reversible fuel cells, supercapacitors, and superconducting magnetic storage through the first and second law of thermodynamics. By fixing an electrical output of 100 kW for all systems, the energy efficiencies obtained for the considered energy storage methods vary between 10.9% and 74.6% whereas, the exergy efficiencies range between 23.1% and 71.9%. The exergy destruction rates are also calculated for each system ranging from 1.640 kW to 356 kW. The highest destruction rate is obtained for the solar-driven molten salt thermal energy storage system since it includes thermal energy conversion via the heliostat field. Furthermore, the roundtrip efficiencies for the electrochemical and electromagnetic storage systems are compared with the analyzed systems, ranging from 58% to 94%. Renewable sources (solar, wind, ocean current, biomass, and geothermal) energy conversion efficiencies are also considered for the final round-trip performances. The molten salt and hot water systems are applicable to solar, geothermal, and biomass. The highest source-to-electricity efficiency is obtained for the super magnetic storage with 37.6% when using wind, ocean current, and biomass sources. Â© 2020 The Author(s)

TI  - Understanding Marine Geo-Technical Engineering, Gas Hydrate Energy Release and the Role of External Stimuli
AB  - In the modern world globalization is good because when trade stops war begins. In the Geo environment methane is non toxic, yet it is extremely flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane is violently reactive with oxidizers, halogen and some halogen containing compounds. Methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Methane will burn between lower explosive limit (LEL) and upper explosive limit (UEL). LEL is 5% UEL is 15% by percentage volume. In this paper the application of marine geo technical engineering related to soil shear strength is linked to the chemical reactions of methane hydrates. Methane clathrate compounds buried in marine sediments is a powerful green house gas. By increasing the temperature leads to further temperature rise and further methane clathrate destabilization. Initiating a runaway process as irreversible once firing of a gun is started. Runaway methane clathrate may cause drastic alteration of the ocean environment (ocean acidification and stratification). In Permian â€“ Triassic event (P-T event) (great dying)/Great Permian extinction, runaway method was also responsible. Marine invertebrates suffered the greatest losses but fortunately life recovered quickly after P-T extinction. Methane clathrate is released as gas into the surrounding water column or soils when ambient temperature increases. By controlled bombing the methane can be burnt continuously in the marine environment. In this method the marine temperature is raised and accelerated runaway chemical reaction is created artificially. In the coastal low pressure region reasonably high temperature can be created by bombing and the gas hydrates takes responsibility for the rest of the destruction. The marine soil slump will further help the flammable methane. This type of non nuclear bombing supported by methane hydrate will keep two warring nations to think about future peace and existence. Since it is non nuclear and temporary shock treatment the nations will spend more time on peace and avoid war. Before resorting to this method all nations should concentrate on mutually benefiting trade practices because when globalization trade stops war begins. Â© 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Studies on combination of methane gas extraction techniques applicable to gas hydrate reservoirs of Indian continental margins
AB  - Gas hydrate is a promising alternate energy to cater to our future fuel requirement. Exploration and extraction for gas hydrate is a nascent science in international scenario and varies with reference to the different site conditions. Methane hydrate is solid clathrate compound that can trap small hydrocarbon natural gas within polyhedral cages formed from hydrogen-bonded water molecules at low temperature and high pressure conditions. Natural occurrence of methane hydrates are reported from permafrost regions and deep ocean marine settings. In India gas hydrates were found to be available in Krishna-Godhavari (KG) basin, Mahanadi basin and Andaman Basin. Occurrence of gas hydrates varies with reference to the different settings with a maximum of thickness of 120 m in fractured clays in KG basin at a water depth of 1000 m and 40m below seafloor. Gas hydrate extraction techniques can be classified under the categories of thermal stimulation, depressurization and inhibitor injection. Each methodology has its own advantage and disadvantages. Phase changes are the key requirement to understand reservoir behavior when applying the gas hydrate extraction technique. This article deals with heat transfer mechanism by thermal stimulation in combination with de-pressurization concept for methane gas extraction. By using thermal stimulation technique, it is possible to confine the energy delivery into the gas hydrate bearing reservoir to dissociate the reservoir for methane production. Since the overburden materials are unconsolidated montmorillonite type clays with high water content and swelling nature, stability of the reservoir in sustainable way is the challenge. By considering the reservoir settings, simulations were performed using MATLAB and TOUGH + HYDRATE software with the results from laboratory studies. Results indicate that it is possible to raise the temperature of gas hydrate bearing sediments to the extent required for dissociation. Experiments were performed using the bentonite clay prepared with matching water content and having similar thermal conductivity to the gas hydrate reservoir associated sediment conditions. It is also observed that the heating the low thermal conductivity sediments bearing reservoir had limitations which could be overcome by combining with the depressurization to pump out the dissociated water in the reservoir. This will work as depressurization concept for further enhancing the dissociation of surrounding reservoir. The energy balance results show that the energy supplied and produced could be better than the ratio of 1: 4. An approach on sustainable extraction and the practical challenges in realizing a field scale system with reference to Indian gas-hydrate reservoir settings are dealt. Â© 2014 IEEE.

TI  - On-bottom stability design of pipelines and umbilicals on seabed susceptible to scour: A multi-faceted approach
AB  - Pipelines and umbilicals are essential elements in any offshore hydrocarbon development. Ensuring the onbottom stability of pipelines and umbilicals during their operational lifetime is an integral part of the design of offshore hydrocarbon developments. During storm events, pipelines and umbilicals can be subjected to significant hydrodynamic loads. Analysis approaches to assess the on-bottom stability of pipelines have evolved over time to arrive at currently accepted pipeline stability requirements. Early simple approaches relied on determining the minimum pipeline specific gravity that satisfied the force balance between the hydrodynamic loads and the pipeline submerged weight and the soil resistance (typically considered as a Coulomb friction factor). Recent more detailed approaches have been developed using finite element modeling of a three dimensional pipeline, time domain storm loading and dynamic soil resistance modeling (See Youssef and O'Brien Ref. 17 for example). Project costs can be significantly impacted where pipeline or umbilical self-weight is insufficient to ensure the on-bottom stability requirements and secondary stabilization is deemed necessary. However, for seabed material susceptible to scour, there is still more engineering work to be done to achieve more economic pipeline on-bottom stability designs. On-bottom stability recommended practice DNVGL-RP-F109 (Ref. 7) does not take into account the effects of seabed instability on the on-bottom stability of pipelines. Seabed materials in many regions around the world are known to be mobile. Seabed mobility can occur at hydrodynamic conditions significantly lower than the hydrodynamic conditions that would cause instability of a pipeline or umbilical resting on a flat seabed. While seabed scour process can have a significant influence on the stability of pipelines and umbilicals, the scour processes are relatively random and time dependant. This complicates the task of predicting the exact evolution of the scour process and accounting for the impact of scour on the stability assessments. Moreover, the extent of scour and pipeline self-burial is dependent not only on the magnitude of the hydrodynamic loading, but also on the duration of exposure and the hydrodynamic loading history. As stated by DNVGL-RP-F114 (Ref. 8) on the effects of seabed scour on the on-bottom stability "This is a complex process, and design methodologies taking these effects into account have not yet been fully developed'. The on-bottom stability approach presented in this paper is based on an understanding of how seabed scour processes develop in the presence of the pipelines and the resultant impact on the pipeline stability. Numerous field observations and other evidence of pipelines and umbilicals becoming self-buried during their operational lifetime due to seabed scour have consolidated the need to account for scour in the on-bottom stability analysis. This approach accounts for the interaction between seabed scour, pipeline self-burial and on-bottom stability to better predict the pipeline on-bottom stability during design, and to eliminate or reduce the need for any secondary stabilization. The approach has been built up and validated through: 1) offshore field observations and records of pipelines and umbilicals, 2) Physical testing results of pipe models on erodible soil, 3) Theoretical approaches that predict scour and pipeline self-burial mechanisms, 4) Absolute stability analysis methodology of DNVGL-RP-F109 (Ref. 7). The objective of this paper is to outline a methodology that can be applied to allow seabed scour to be incorporated into on-bottom stability assessments for new pipelines. It should be noted that seabed mobility may also affect other design considerations such as free spanning, pipeline thermal expansion, axial walking, buckling and fatigue analyses. However, these analyses are not part of the scope of this paper. Â© 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Three-dimensional self-floating foam composite impregnated with porous carbon and polyaniline for solar steam generation
AB  - A promising approach to resolving insufficient freshwater resources is utilizing solar energy for steam generation. Although various types of photothermal conversion materials have been developed, there are still some obstacles, such as complicated system structure fabrication and low energy utilization, that severely hinder their practical application. Herein, we designed and produced a self-floating porous carbon/polyaniline foam (PCPF) evaporator via impregnating melamine foam with porous carbon generated following the bottom-up pyrolytic method and polyaniline, followed by thermal treatment, for efficient solar steam generation. The PCPF obtained with a porous carbon (PC) to polyaniline (PAN) mass ratio of 3:5 (PCPF-3) exhibited a rich pore structure, good hydrophilicity, low thermal conductivity (0.0413 W mâˆ’1 Kâˆ’1), and excellent light absorption (96.1%). Our results show that, without additional thermal insulators, the evaporation rate of PCPF-3 reached 1.496 kg mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1, and the photothermal conversion efficiency reached 87.3% under one sun irradiation. Furthermore, it also exhibited good durability and desalination performance. This type of environmentally friendly, low-cost, and stable photothermal conversion material could be used in water treatment and seawater desalination. Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Super-flexible phase change materials with a dual-supporting effect for solar thermoelectric conversion in the ocean environment
AB  - Solar thermoelectric generators (STEGs) based on phase change materials (PCMs) are an emerging advanced technology to collect and utilize solar energy. However, it is still challenging for photo-driven PCMs to make use of the huge amount of solar energy in oceans due to their limited shape stability and stability underwater. Herein, dual-supporting super-flexible PCMs (SFPCMs) comprising a natural rubber (NR) continuous network and island-like dispersed paraffin wax (PW) microcapsules were developed. The interaction between the NR matrix and phase change microcapsules (PCMCs) was further improved by incorporating a small amount of MXene to enhance the photo-absorption ability, mechanical performance, and thermal conductivity of the composite PCMs. In addition to excellent stretchability and compressibility, this dual-supporting structure consisting of a continuous NR network and encapsulated polyurethane (PU) shell endowed SFPCMs with unprecedented leakage resistance and underwater stability, even in various harsh environments. More impressively, a proof-of-concept STEG based on SFPCMs with a photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 92\% was proposed, exhibiting excellent cycling output stability in a simulated ocean environment with an output voltage of 410 mV. This work expands the application potential of photo-driven PCMs to efficiently harvest solar energy from the ocean environment.

TI  - Spar installation in deep water - A developing capability
AB  - Over the past three years experience has been gained with the installation of Spars in deep water using Heerema's Deepwater Construction Vessel (DCV) Balder and Semi Submersible Crane Vessels (SSCV) Hermod and Thialf. The facilities involved are the Horn Mountain, Gunnison, Holstein and Mad Dog Spars, each with their specific characteristics and associated challenges. The offshore installation of the moorings, hulls and topsides for these projects required utilization of the equipment to its maximum limit. Technical challenges involved among others the fibre rope moorings, the Loop and Eddy currents which frequently influenced the installation area and the interaction between installation vessel and Spar when setting major topsides. The paper describes how the technical challenges were tackled and how emphasis was given on feeding knowledge back to subsequent projects. In particular the paper will address the lessons learned both from a technical point of view as well as from a project management and contracting stand point. Because DCV Balder can switch from facility installation mode (mooring systems and topsides) to pipeline installation mode, schedule flexibility and risk mitigation were added advantages to the operator.

TI  - Total ecosystem carbon stocks of mangroves across broad global environmental and physical gradients
AB  - Mangroves sequester large quantities of carbon (C) that become significant sources of greenhouse gases when disturbed through land-use change. Thus, they are of great value to incorporate into climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. In response, a global network of mangrove plots was established to provide policy-relevant ecological data relating to interactions of mangrove C stocks with climatic, tidal, plant community, and geomorphic factors. Mangroves from 190 sites were sampled across five continents encompassing large biological, physical, and climatic gradients using consistent methodologies for the quantification of total ecosystem C stocks (TECS). Carbon stock data were collected along with vegetation, physical, and climatic data to explore potential predictive relationships. There was a 28-fold range in TECS (79-2,208 Mg C/ha) with a mean of 856 +/- 32 Mg C/ha. Belowground C comprised an average 85\% of the TECS. Mean soil depth was 216 cm, ranging from 22 to >300 cm, with 68 sites (35\%) exceeding a depth of 300 cm. TECS were weakly correlated with metrics of forest structure, suggesting that aboveground forest structure alone cannot accurately predict TECS. Similarly, precipitation was not a strong predictor of TECS. Reasonable estimates of TECS were derived via multiple regression analysis using precipitation, soil depth, tree mass, and latitude (R-2 = 0.54) as variables. Soil carbon to a 1 m depth averaged 44\% of the TECS. Limiting analyses of soil C stocks to the top 1 m of soils result in large underestimates of TECS as well as in the greenhouse gas emissions that would arise from their conversion to other land uses. The current IPCC Tier 1 default TECS value for mangroves is 511 Mg C/ha, which is only 60\% of our calculated global mean. This study improves current assessments of mangrove C stocks providing a foundation necessary for C valuation related to climate change mitigation. We estimate mangroves globally store about 11.7 Pg C: an aboveground carbon stock of 1.6 Pg C and a belowground carbon stock of 10.2 Pg C). The differences in the estimates of total ecosystem carbon stocks based on climate, salinity, forest structure, geomorphology, or geopolitical boundaries are not as much of an influence as the choice of soil depth included in the estimate. Choosing to limit soils to a 1 m depth resulted in estimates of 1 m depth resulted in global carbon stock estimates that exceeded 11.2 Pg C.

TI  - Using medium voltage drive MVD for preheating the induction motor im of electric submersible pump ESP to extend its deepwater run life
AB  - This paper provides the validation test results of preheat sequence applied to induction motors at two Test Facilities and offshore application for operation in the Gulf of Mexico. Although the objective of preheating Induction Motors (IM) is to lower the viscosity of the lubricant oil by 2 orders of magnitude (from 1000 cP to 10cP) for extending Electric Sumersible Pump (ESP) run life, this paper is exclusively focused on motor preheating results. The motor is energized with low voltage at a frequency of 120Hz maintaining the voltage low enough in order to keep the supplied shaft torque under the system's breakaway torque; thus the shaft never spins. The Medium Voltage Drive (MVD) is a Variable Frequency Drive output power determines heat rate that is adjusted to obtain temperature slope of 1Â°F/min specified by the project. The motor is modeled electrically and magnetically through Finite Element Analisys (FEA) to estimate its power losses; the motor internal temperatures can be predicted by the Motor-CAD (Computer-Aided Design) thermal model which is calibrated by winding resistance change and skin tempeperature measurement. The systems for validation were:â€¢ First test facilities: 1500hp Induction Motor coupled to a pump and driven with a 2500hp MVDâ€¢ Second test facilities: 1500hp Induction Motor coupled to a dyno and driven with a 2500hp MVD.â€¢ Offshore: Five 1500hp ESPs driven with 2500hp MVD each. The results at first and second test facilities and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate the preheat sequence can be successfully implemented in the field by using existing MVD with little software changes in order to apply low voltage at 120Hz without spinning the rotor. The stator current and induced current on the rotor make motor internal temperature (including lubricant oil) to rise achieving different temperature slopes. Temperature slopes vary in function of applied motor current (there was no need of overpassing motor nominal current on any test), motor thermal capacity, initial motor temperature, and external temperature. All tested motors are very similar and was found that Keeping heating power at around 34kW, winding temperature rise can be achieved at a rate of 1.52Â°F/min at an initial temperature of 38Â°F and 1.2Â°F/min at an initial temperature of 148Â°F. Temperature rise rate at the motor air gap (actually filled with oil) and bearings location can also be predicted by the motor thermal model. The required preheating time is previously calculated to reach less than 10cP viscosity of lubricant oil to guarantee safe startup without the occurrence of bearing spin; otherwise bearing friction torque overcomes the T-ring retaining torque causing bearing(s) damage. When the need of preheating the induction motor of electric submersible pumps installed in deepwater applications was identified, there was no clear means to make it possible. This was the first time that concept was applied and successfully implemented in the field. A second milestone was to preheat the motor with the MVD without adding equipment. Among five potential methods for preheating the motor, the selected scheme worked as expected with minimum MVD software changes. Â© Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers

South Atlantic Bight (SAB) contrasts these findings in that it acts as a source of CO2 to the atmosphere while simultaneously exporting dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to the open ocean. The shelf-wide heterotrophy and carbon exports in the SAB are subsidized by the export of organic carbon from the abundant intertidal marshes, which are a sink for atmospheric CO2. It is proposed here that the SAB represents a marsh-dominated heterotrophic ocean margin as opposed to river-dominated autotrophic margins. Based on this and other studies, DIC export flux from margins to the open ocean must be significant in the overall global ocean carbon budget.

TI  - Three layers of energy law for examining CO2 transport for carbon-capture and storage
AB  - This research is a legal analysis concerning four scenarios for cross-border carbon dioxide (CO2) transport that could increase the deployment of carbon-capture and storage (CCS) deployment in Europe. The legal analysis categorizes the law into three levels-international, national and local-and considers the four scenarios in light of these three levels of energy law. Upon reviewing the four scenarios, it is clear that the Rotterdam Nucleus (referred to as the `Pilot Case') is the leading scenario and as a result it is explored in more detail. The potential Pilot Case is based on the development of Rotterdam (in the Netherlands) as a southern North Sea hub. Under this Rotterdam Nucleus scenario, captured CO2 will be transported through the Port of Rotterdam to depleted gas fields offshore the Netherlands. CO2 will also be transported through further links using CCS infrastructure to facilitate the processing of undeveloped gas fields offshore UK. The Pilot case contemplates further expansion opportunities, increasing the capture clusters through additional pipelines, expanding to further gas fields and using the port of Rotterdam for CO2 shipping-hence the analysis of the other scenarios may be invaluable in the future development of CO2 networks in the EU. Finally, and an original contribution of this article is that it employs the three lawyers of energy law theoretical framework to an energy problem that was examined by an interdisciplinary research team. Furthermore, this research was developed further through two key industry stakeholder meetings with CCS experts in the EU.

TI  - Underwater target tracking of offshore crane system in subsea operations
AB  - Accurate underwater target tracking during subsea lowering is a complex technological problem in offshore installation and deep ocean mining. It involves the real-time motion compensation of both combined effects from flow-induced vibration on the cable-payload and wave-induced motions on the host vessel. A target tracking mechanism for a planar motion was theoretically derived and simulated in this paper under both regular and irregular wave motions. The simulation results have shown that the proposed target tracking system, by using PID controller integrated with hydrodynamic effects of both surface vessel and subsea payload, has followed the movable subsea target with small vicinity. The findings of this paper can be further implemented in the development of automatizing the subsea operations of the offshore crane system. Â© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.

TI  - Does wireless improve process automation?
AB  - StatoilHydro has successfully implemented self-organizing wireless mesh technology at its Grane offshore platform, which is stationed offshore Bergen, Norway, to improve the performance of its facility monitoring process. The Emerson Smart Wireless network, developed by Emerson Process Management, includes 22 wireless Rosemount pressure transmitters, which replaced traditional gauges. The technology enables continuous monitoring of pressures and eliminates the need for daily visits to the wellhead to manually record gauge readings through remote monitoring. This enables unusual readings to be identified earlier and action taken to investigate and rectify faults before they become serious problems. The wireless technology solutions can also be applied to a number of applications including monitoring open-loop control and supervisory closed-loop control thereby improving safety, reliability, efficiency and environmental compliance.

TI  - `80 feet sustainable motoryacht: Technological solutions concept of the living spaces on board
AB  - The current development of new technologies in the nautical field has enabled the designers to transform and improve all the aspects related to ergonomics and comfort in internal yacht spaces, related to the different conditions of use of the product. The introduction and dissemination of new regulations governing the different ways of using the coast, combined with new production and storage technologies of ``renewable{''} green energy sources, suggest us a new design approach no longer bound to traditional layout schemes, but based towards new layouts and new architectural languages. Yachts can be considered the testing ground for cutting-edge sustainable design solutions, aimed to improve the life quality on board, and to ensure the possibility of navigation in certain environmental contexts undergoing constraint{[}1]. The use of new technologies, innovative materials and advanced production processes, can generate new formal models, determine new spatial solutions, and enable the development of new concepts that allow the designers to respond to the demands of corporate representation, improving the relationship of the product with the reference context{[}2]. In these first phases, the research, conducted at the Architectural Department of the University ``G.d'Annunzio{''} of Chieti-Pescara (Italy), reports a series of critical reflections related to the conscious design of the yacht living spaces, taking into account of various factors, such as: the environmental context, natural lighting and visual perception, on-board activities, management of the vessel, and hybrid propulsion systems.

TI  - Wastewater, reclaimed water, and seawater utilization in the production of microalgae-based fuels
AB  - Biofuel production from microalgae is affected by the cost of the cultivation of microalgal biomass. The cultivation of microalgae for third-generation biofuels in wastewater, reclaimed water, and seawater could be a cost-effective way to obtain microalgal biomass. This option would serve to reduce costs and treat wastewaters and reclaimed water at the same time. Autotrophic and mixotrophic cultivation make use of wastewater and nutrients, using light and CO2 to obtain high percentages of nitrogen and phosphorous removal. The advantage of microalgae grown in this way is twofold: wastewater treatment and microalgal production without the addition of water and nutrients. Biofuels from microalgae grown in this way would replace fossil fuels with renewable and carbon-neutral fuels in a sustainable way and contribute to the circular economy of water resources. In this review, an updated evaluation of microalgal cultivation in wastewater, reclaimed water, and seawater together with biofuel generation will be shown. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of a Hybrid Power Plant Comprising Used EV-Batteries to Complement Wind Power
AB  - This paper investigates the potential of using second-hand electric vehicle (EV) batteries to provide storage in a hybrid wind battery plant (HWBP). A number of used Li-ion EV batteries are assumed connected to an existing wind park operating on the noninterconnected island of Crete. The optimal size of the hybrid extension is determined using genetic algorithms (GAs). The potential revenues that can be achieved by the HWBP from its participation in the electricity market are estimated. Results indicate that the proposed business model is economically beneficial in case rejected wind energy is stored for later use. Profit margin varies according to the price of oil consumed by the thermal units whose energy is substituted by the output of the HWBP.

TI  - Application of experimental design in selecting a development plan for the Agbami field
AB  - The Agbami project team was challenged to generate a field development plan and to assess that plan over a wide range of uncertainty. Complete stakeholder alignment around the technical aspects of the development plan was a critical issue. Field data, laboratory data, and analog data were incorporated into a range of reservoir simulation models. The field data included appraisal well logs, cores, 3D seismic, fluid samples, pressure data, and drill stem tests. Three hundred reservoir models were constructed and ranked using streamline simulation for both static and dynamic attributes to assess the range of subsurface uncertainty. A project team with significant but diverse deepwater development experience was formed and co-located. A formal phased decision making process was implemented. During each phase of the process key parameters of uncertainty were identified and ranked in terms of project impact. Field development options were evaluated in distinct phases over the full range of uncertainty. Experimental Design (ED) methodology was used throughout the evaluation to obtain the maximum information with the minimum computational effort. The paper shows how the results from this process facilitated the identification of the key uncertainties and provided direct input into economic models for decision analysis. In Phase Two of the evaluation the pressure maintenance scheme selected for the 17 million year (MY) reservoir was crestal gas re-injection with peripheral water injection. Crestal gas re-injection was selected for the 14MY and 16MY reservoirs. The facility capacity requirements were also selected during this phase at 250,000 stock tank bbl of oil per day (STB/D) and 450,000 thousand standard cubic ft per day (Mscf/D). Peer reviews and assists were held and alignment was obtained along with action items to be included in the subsequent phase. In Phase Three of the evaluation the well count parameter was investigated and an optimum number of 38 wells was selected. Production profiles were generated and presented in terms of P10, P50, and P90. Copyright 2004, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Energy balance of global CO2 recycling and amounts of reduction of CO2 emission
AB  - On the basis of tailoring of amorphous alloy electrodes for seawater electrolysis to form H-2 and amorphous alloy catalysts for conversion of CO2 to CH4, we are proposing global CO2 recycling: At deserts; power generation by solar energy, at coasts close to the deserts; production of H-2 by electrolysis of seawater, production of CH4 by the reaction of H-2 and CO2 transported, and at energy consuming districts; combustion of CH4, recovery of CO2 and transportation of liquefied CO2 to the coast close to the deserts. Since Egyptian scientists agree with us to do collaboration, the energy balance and the amount of reduction of CO2 emission in the global CO2 recycling between Middle East and Japan are estimated for the operation of a 1 GW CH4-combustion power plant. The energy consumed in a year up to liquefaction of CH4 including that corresponding to the repayment of solar power plant is almost the same as that spent up to obtaining LNG. The energy necessary for the global CO2 recycling is only 8.7\% higher than the energy necessary for LNG combustion for power generation without control of CO2 emission. The extra energy is for recovery, liquefaction and transportation of CO2. The reduction of CO2 emission by the global CO2 recycling is 79\% of CO2 emission from an LNG combustion power plant, that is, 2.62 Mtons/year.

TI  - An innovative, low cost solution for sampling in highly deviated wells
AB  - Sampling in a highly deviated well involves additional risks that can compromise efficiency and costs. Operators and service companies have developed options to overcome the technical challenge of going from tubing-assisted logging to tractor-conveyed operations. Tubing-assisted logging will mitigate the issues and stuck risks caused by wireline key seating, differential sticking, swelling formations, heavy muds, borehole breakout, doglegs, ledges, and cuttings but will require slower operations resulting in additional rig time and therefore costs. Tractor conveyance, on the contrary, can be efficient but will add costly operating rates and higher cost exposure if the tools are lost in hole. An operator in offshore Southeast Asia had an objective to perform formation evaluation by means of pressure tests with pump out to obtain clean samples for CO2-level measurements in a slim well geometry (6 1/8-in. hole) with 73Â° deviation. Sampling wheels that configure with the wireline formation tester tool were introduced to the operator to reduce the contact area, keep the tool body off the low side of the borehole wall, and aid gravity descent. The operation objective was successfully accomplished and reached the target depth (TD)/reservoirs by performing five pressure tests, setting up three fluid characterization stations, and retrieving six samples in approximately 12.5 operating hours, resulting in savings of more than USD 350,000 for the operator.

TI  - Nutrient dynamics in core sediments of an artificial basal medium prepared with steelmaking slag and dredged materials
AB  - The availability of steelmaking slag, an industrial by-product, was examined as a component of a basal medium for the creation and regeneration of shallow habitats in coastal ecosystems. We investigated nutrient dynamics in sediments prepared with slag and dredged materials by conducting a core incubation experiment for 379 days. Silica sand was used as the reference material. Although slag caused alkalization of pore water, the pH in the surface layer recovered within a few days. The use of slag had limited influence on the dissolved inorganic nitrogen content, but pore water phosphate concentrations were considerably suppressed in slag-based media, especially when the pH was high. Nutrient diffusion fluxes from slag- and sand-based sediment cores were comparable to those in natural coastal environments. After 379 days, more than 90 \% of the nutrients remained in the top 5 cm of the cores. Moreover, the sustained release of nutrients from basal media prepared with slag may play an important role in sustaining the productivity of macrophytobenthic ecosystems, including seagrass meadows. The mesocosm-scale experiment we proposed could evaluate long-term variations of nutrient dynamics in the artificial basal media. Because of wide variations in chemical properties among the different types of slag and dredged materials, approaches similar to this study may be essential before any large-scale application to marine environments.

TI  - Exergy Analysis of Steam Pressure Reduction Valve in Marine Propulsion Plant on Conventional LNG Carrier
AB  - Paper has presented an exergy analysis of steam pressure reduction valve, unavoidable element in the steam propulsion plant on LNG carrier. The steam pressure reduction valve was analyzed in a wide range of steam system loads. Along with pressure decrease, through the valve also occur decrease in steam temperature and increase in steam specific entropy. The pressure decrease of the analyzed valve ranges from 4.846 MPa up to 5.027 MPa while the average steam temperature decrease for the whole observed operating range amounts 74.8 degrees C. At the ambient temperature of 25 degrees C, valve exergy destruction ranges from 121.72 kW up to 180.64 kW, while exergy efficiency amounts from 80.28 \% up to 80.54 \%. Variation in the ambient temperature, for the expected engine room temperature range, showed that the exergy destruction of pressure reduction valve increases and exergy efficiency decreases during the increase in the ambient temperature. The lowest average value of pressure reduction valve exergy destruction was obtained at the ambient temperature of 10 degrees C and amounts 152.03 kW, while at the same ambient temperature was obtained the highest average exergy efficiency of 82.77 \%. The highest valve exergy destruction and the lowest exergy efficiency were obtained at the highest observed ambient temperature of 40 degrees C.

TI  - Algae-inspired multifunctional ocean solar-energy conversion chain enabled by coordination polymers
AB  - Ocean solar energy is important for underwater devices. However, the intermittent irradiation and the requirements of many accompanying functional parts make the related devices huge and expensive. It is still a challenge to realize an all-in-one solar-energy conversion platform that can provide a continuous power supply, seawater sensing, and environment restoration simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate an algae-inspired strategy to achieve a multiple-function, ocean solar-energy conversion chain. Specifically, Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) of coordination polymers serve as a robust transshipment depot to connect a photon-driven oxygen-evolution part, with other components enabling the underwater system to produce electricity and oxygen for low-oxygen-zone restoration, to supply continuous day and night electricity, and to sense seawater in authentic seawater. The stability of the system is demonstrated for more than 100 day-night cycles. The concept presented here highlights the prospect of using ocean solar energy to achieve multiple tasks with an all-in-one platform.

SECARB represents 11 southeastern states and is comprised of &gt; 100 research partners and participants. There are &gt; 900 large, stationary sources of CO2 in the SECARB geographical region that contribute 31% of the country's CO2 stationary source emissions.

TI  - Mooring line damping due to first- and second-order vessel motion
AB  - In some recent OTC papers (Refs. 1 and 2) the importance of a catenary mooring system in producing surge damping of the moored vessel has been demonstrated. The present paper aims at clarifying the effect of superposed wave frequency line motiohs upon the low frequency surge damping of the mooring system. A series of experiments have been performed, determining separately the various contributions to the total surge damping. This has been achieved by testing a ship model with and without catenary mooring, with and without artificial excitation of the turret, by calm water surge decay tests and by irregular wave tests. A theory and numerical method is presented for calculating the surge damping due to the mooring system. The numerical results compare very well with experiments as far as a pure sinusoidal low frequency surge is concerned, but not so well in the case of superposed high frequency motions. As an important overall conclusion the wave frequency motions of the system as tested increase the low frequency damping by a factor in the range of 2 to 4 for typical sea states.

TI  - BEHAVIOR OF RUBBERS UNDER SIMULATED OFFSHORE CONDITIONS
AB  - Rubber components have become indispensable parts for offshore oil production and other offshore activities. These components regularly contact not only oil, but also various gases (CH4, CO2, H2S, etc.) and aqueous media. The applicability and lifetime of rubber elements are influenced to a great extent by environmental factors. Therefore, knowledge of the effects of different factors is highly important for designers. An unexpected failure of any part might jeopardize safe operation and result in interrupting production. Long term laboratory experiments were carried out in order to gain information on the expected behaviour of various elastomers (polychloroprene, nitrile rubber, hydrogenated nitrile rubber and fluorelastomer). In this study, the influence of gas, gaseous oil with H2S and without it at high pressure (up to 30 MPa) and different temperatures (20-130-degrees-C) was investigated in detail. We intend to outline some experimental methods which can be used to evaluate the performance of rubber used under multiple environmental conditions. After the fluid treatments the change in physical properties of the rubber compounds was measured. The test results were analysed in two different ways which provide opportunities to estimate the long term behaviour of rubber under well defined working conditions. Conversely, a precise knowledge of physical and chemical effects loading the rubber and required lifetime makes it possible to design the most suitable rubber material for a given purpose. Under high pressure gas the change of permeation coefficient of the polymer after repeated rapid decompressions indicates the formation and growth of fracture inside the rubber.

TI  - Benefits of Blue Carbon Stocks in a Coastal Jazan Ecosystem Undergoing Land Use Change
AB  - Coastal ecosystems are characterized by high content of soil carbon storage; however, they experience severe land conversions in the past decades. The current study aims to examine how different land use/land cover (LU/LC) impact carbon stock in coastal ecosystem along Jazan coast, Saudi Arabia. In this study, impacts of LU/LC on carbon stocks in the coastal zone of Jazan, Saudi Arabia in 2009, 2013, and 2021 were assessed. Also, the LU/LC dynamics were evaluated using data provided by the land use dynamic model. The carbon stocks were modelled based on LU/LC using the InVEST program. Our study results showed that the decrease in mangroves from 2013 to 2021 reflects the high atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). Also, the increase in built-up areas might negatively impact total carbon stock. The estimated carbon stocks for the coastal zone of Jazan biome were 7279027.42 Mg C in 2009 (1Mg = 10(6) g). It decreased to 2827817.84 Mg C in 2013, with a total loss of - 4450675.40 Mg C, and an average of annual loss of - 1,112,669 Mg C in the study period with net value of - 461240790.53 US\$. On the other hand, the total estimated carbon stock was increased from 2013 to 2021 with a 3772968.31 Mg C in 2021 (a total gain 944840.87 Mg C). Based on the current findings, we recommend that land-use-policy makers and environmental government agencies should implement conservation policies to reduce land use change at Jazan coastal ecosystems.

TI  - An energy consumption approach to estimate air emission reductions in container shipping
AB  - Container shipping is the largest producer of emissions within the maritime shipping industry. Hence, measures have been designed and implemented to reduce ship emission levels. IMOâ€™s MARPOL Annex VI, with its future plan of applying Tier III requirements, the Energy Efficiency Design Index for new ships, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan for all ships. To assist policy formulation and follow-up, this study applies an energy consumption approach to estimate container ship emissions. The volumes of sulphur oxide (SOx), nitrous oxide (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from container ships are estimated using 2018 datasets on container shipping and average vessel speed records generated via AIS. Furthermore, the estimated reductions in SOx, NOx, PM, and CO2 are mapped for 2020. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the energy consumption approach is a valuable method to estimate ongoing emission reductions on a continuous basis and to fill data gaps where needed, as the latest worldwide container shipping emissions records date back to 2015. The presented analysis supports early-stage detection of environmental impacts in container shipping and helps to determine in which areas the greatest potential for emission reductions can be found.

TI  - An experimental platform of variable speed pumped storage unit under wave disturbance: introduction and preliminary progress
AB  - The importance of pumped storage plants (PSPs) is continuously increasing in power systems with more and more variable renewable energies. For the research and development of PSPs, variable speed technology and sea-water PSP are two important new orientations. In this paper, an experimental platform of variable speed pumped storage unit under wave disturbance is introduced. The purpose of the platform is to study the design and operation mechanism of variable speed P SP based on various common technical problems, especially for the four aspects: transient processes, variable speed unit, coordination control, wave disturbance. The platform adopts a Chinese sea-water PSP in feasibility stage as the prototype, and a model scale of 1:4 is applied. It consists of nine sub-systems, including waterway system, variable speed reversible model unit, circulating water system, speed governor system, AC excitation and electric protection, coordination control, monitoring system, intelligent AC load and measurement system. The model unit contains a reversible pump turbine, a doubly fed induction machine, etc. The speed variation range is +/- 8\%, and the rated power is 78.13 kW. The model runner meets the IEC standard with a reference diameter of 284.3 mm. The upstream water tank is a closed pressure tank that can adjust the pressure and discharge. The downstream water tank is an open water tank that can simulate wave level fluctuation. Regarding the control system, it has four core parts: local control unit, speed governor, converter and coordination controller. The experimental study content contains three key aspects: (1) performance validation for variable speed unit; (2) operating stability under complex disturbances; (3) capability of variable speed PSP during transient processes. The experimental study based on the platform aims for laying a theoretical and technical foundation for the follow-up construction and operation of real seawater PSPs with variable speed units.

TI  - Enabling bioeconomy with offshore macroalgae biorefineries
AB  - The bioeconomy provides a possible solution for the increasing demand on natural resources by substitution of the nonrenewable resources with resources derived from biomass, thus reducing the environmental impact of fossil fuels. A fundamental unit that will enable the bioeconomy implementation is biorefinery. The bioeconomy is a collective term for the complex system that includes biomass production, transportation, conversion into products, and product distribution. In this chapter, we introduce the concept of offshore marine biorefineries as potential drivers for the bioeconomy of the future. We discuss fundamental thermodynamics principles that determine the optimum scale of biorefineries and put the limit for the services area for a single-processing unit. We provide a review of the current methods to produce biomass offshore. Next, we exemplify the marine biorefineries, which show co-production of several products from the same biomass, thus reducing the waste and maximizing economic benefit from the unit. In addition, we discuss the economic and environmental challenges of marine biorefineries as an emerging platform for society transition to low-carbon economy.

TI  - Laboratory tests on local damage detection for jacket-type offshore structures using optical FBG sensors based on statistical approaches
AB  - In this study, a local damage detection based on statistical approach for jacket-type offshore structures by principal component analysis (PCA) and linear adaptive filter (LAF) techniques using strain response data measured by FBG sensors was proposed while dynamic responses are being popularly utilized for damage detection of civil infrastructures including jacket-type offshore structures. In addition, environmental effects due to variations in temperature and external loading were intensively investigated and an efficient remedy was proposed using the nonparametric PCA and LAF models. Unlike many existing statistical damage detection methods, the mean of residual values eliminating the environmental effects was utilized as damage index for rational for enhancing the normality based on the central limit theorem and the normality was first checked before damage estimation using the mean of residual values. Laboratory tests for a scaled tidal current power plant structure, one of many jacket-type offshore structures, were conducted to investigate the technical feasibility of the proposed method for damage detection and localization. It was found that the PCA technique could more efficiently eliminate undesired environmental effects contained in the measurement data from FBG sensors without any additional information on the environmental changes, resulting in more damage-sensitive features under various environmental changes.

The International Seabed Authority (ISA) wrestles with a wide range of issues and complex interactions that may affect not only how the industry develops over time, but also how development will benefit mankind. Two key issues they face are the means for sharing the payments from deep sea mining (DSM), and protecting environmental resources in the deep sea from harmful effects. This article provides an overview of issues for deciding among alternative means of distributing the ISA's share of monetary returns that will be realized as deep sea mineral resources, how they are converted from natural assets into financial assets, and alternative approaches to ensure that exploitation of these resources does not come at the expense of mankind also benefiting from the environmental resources provided by the deep sea.

TI  - Operational overview of the first offshore production test of methane hydrates in the Eastern Nankai Trough
AB  - In March 2013, the world's first field trial of gas production from marine methane hydrate deposits was conducted in the Daini Atsumi Knoll area of the Eastern Nankai Trough off the Pacific coast of Japan as a process to bring gas hydrates under seafloor to valuable energy resource. The technique used to dissociate the ice-like material was "depressurization method" that had been applied in the previous production test in Mallik site, the Northwest Territories, Canada in 2007-2008. Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) as a part of MH21, the Research Consortium for Methane Hydrate Resources in Japan planed and supervised the project with the funding of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), and scientific supports from the National Institute of Advance Industrial Science and Technology (AIST). One production well with two monitoring boreholes were drilled in the test site for the test. Along with the flow test operation, intensive data acquisition program was planned and implemented to understand behavior of methane hydrate dissociation-bearing sediments against depressurization. To realize high degree of drawdown in relatively shallow formation below deepwater, several downhole devices were designed and installed. The flow test started in the morning of March 12 and lasted until severe sand production forced to terminate the operation six days later. During the stable production term, gas flow rate was approximately 20,000m3 under atmospheric condition, and gas liquid ratio was larger than 100. A lot of data including formation temperatures, fluid pressure and temperature, and physical property changes in the formation were obtained. The data taken are under studies to verify applicability of the depressurization technique as a methane hydrate production technologies. Copyright 2014, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Bioengineering technologies used for the development and equipment of complex installations to obtain energy from three renewable sources. Complex installations for coastal areas
AB  - Considering that the production of energy from fossil sources causes environmental pollution, increasing health hazards or climate change, the research for new alternative energy sources and the development of high-performance renewable energy conversion systems are a basic concern nowadays. Thus, the development and the use of renewable energy sources can increase diversity in energy supply markets, help to ensure long-term sustainable energy resources, to reduce local and global air emissions, and provide commercial attractive options to meet the specific needs of energy services. This paper aims to improve the efficiency of a patented complex installation which was developed vertically to ensure high-energy efficiency in relation to the occupied area, that integrates three renewable energy sources (wind, solar and hydro), by applying bioengineering solutions. Improvements to the original installation consisted in modifying the initial characteristics of the off-shore system (number of slots, deflectors angle, width of slots and width of deflectors), modification of aerial module blades according to the bioengineering model of the thistle seed (Carduus nutans), and modification of the submerged module paddles according to the bioengineering model of a fish species swimmers. Following the tests performed on the modified complex installation, a major improvement of the energy efficiency compared to the (initial) control installation was observed.

TI  - Design, Development, and Testing of a Smart Buoy for Underwater Testbeds in Shallow Waters
AB  - Underwater wireless communication and networking are becoming key enablers of a number of critical marine and underwater applications. Experimentation is underway, in controlled environments as well as at sea, that concerns the deployment of several underwater devices providing wireless communication capabilities to sensors of different nature. Controlling the deployment at sea of these devices, remotely and efficiently, is paramount for enabling expedite testing of hardware and protocol development. To address this need, this paper presents the design, development, and testing of a Smart Buoy for real-time remote access to underwater devices and for provision of power and extended computational capabilities. Experimental results are shown concerning the time needed to connect with the Smart Buoy, the power consumption of its operations, and the energy harvesting intake (via solar panels) in time. We also investigate the buoy lifetime when powered by solar panels and supporting acoustic modems over varying traffic scenarios. Â© 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Implications of government subsidies on shipping companiesâ€™ shore power usage strategies in port
AB  - The shore power available in ports has a low utilization rate, though its use is an effective way to reduce pollution emissions. Encouraging shipping companies to use shore power has become an important issue in green port construction. This paper builds a Nash game between two shipping companies regarding the decision to use shore power and analyzes the impact of government intervention on the equilibrium that can be reached between them. The result shows that in the absence of government intervention, an equilibrium between the two shipping companies in the use of shore power would require a sufficient benefit. Unfortunately, the two shipping companies could be caught in a prisoner's dilemma when they reach such an equilibrium. However, government intervention through price subsidies can improve this situation, either by expanding the area in which an equilibrium is reached or by mitigating the toll of the prisoner's dilemma. Moreover, price subsidies are also conducive to improving supply chain profits and social welfare. The paper also analyzes the mutual influence between different government intervention methods and the impact of other important factors on the performance of government subsidies. Â© 2022

TI  - Integrated seismic inversion and rock physics analysis for CO2 storage
AB  - The Southeast Offshore Storage Resource Assessment (SOSRA) research project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is focused on assessing the Atlantic offshore resources for CO2 storage. Although the storage capacity of offshore reservoirs is expected to be substantial, and despite having a number of significant advantages over onshore sites, no comprehensive assessment of the offshore storage capacity in the southeastern U.S. has been performed, previously (Franklin, 2009). Based on a study by Smyth et al. (2008) two potential CO2 reservoirs were identified in geologic strata below the Atlantic continental shelf in the Upper and Lower Cretaceous layers.

TI  - Reservoir, Sealing and Trapping of CO2 Storage in Cycle i and II, Sarawak Basin, Malaysia
AB  - Carbon emission has been increasingly alarming due to higher industrial activities. In conjunction with a net zero carbon emission policy by 2050, research has been done to promote CO2underground storage. The offshore Sarawak region had been explored throughout the decade to achieve an enhanced understanding of the basin. The offshore Sarawak Basin has promising storage characteristics which are displayed evidently from wells data and seismic lines. Cycle I and II portrays complex lithofacies which affect porosity and permeability. Cycle I and II analogous to the Nyalau Formation exhibits the lower and upper shoreface facies. The average storage depth is above 1000 m with a fairly warm sedimentary basin of a geothermal gradient &gt;43Â°C. These conditions allow CO2to be stored in a dense phase which will maximise the storage volume and reduce upward migration. The trapping of CO2in these areas improved with intraformational seals of Setap Shale and Lower Cycle III as regional seals. The trapping mechanisms allow CO2to migrate between pores and dissolve into formation water beneath the seal which is laterally extensive within the basin to prevent upward migration. The characteristics described above portrays good reservoir and trapping potential for the CO2storage. Copyright Â© 2021 the European Network for Research in Geo-Energy. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Bioremediation Potential of the Brackishwater Macroalga Gracilaria tenuistipitata (Rhodophyta) Co-cultured with Pacific White Shrimp Penaeus vannamei (Boone)
AB  - The rapid development of intensive shrimp culture has aroused increased concerns about its impact on coastal waters. Practicing propensity of a balanced ecosystem based culture approach is the best way towards sustainability. In this context, seaweed based co-culture finds significance but evaluation of its symbiotic nature needs to be ascertained. Accordingly, an outdoor trial was conducted to arrive at the effective biomass intensity of seaweed Gracilaria tenuistipitata for efficient bioremediation as well as growth and survival of Penaeus vannamei. An experiment with five treatments (different biomass intensity, (0, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 g L-1) revealed that at a biomass intensity of 3.5 g L-1, NH4 - N and PO4 - P significantly (p <0.05) reduced by 95.71\% and 95.74\%, respectively in three weeks. It was also observed that turbidity was significantly lowest (0.94 NTU) and specific growth rate was significantly higher (2.86\% d(-1)) at the same biomass intensity (3.5 g L-1). Average body weight and specific growth rate of P. vannamei were not significantly increased but survival (99.17\%) was significantly (p <0.05) higher. Total bacterial count was also significantly (p <0.05) reduced. This study revealed that seaweed (3.5 g L-1) - shrimp when co- cultured, improves the water quality and has bioremedial benefits in the culture system.

TI  - Parasitism enhances gastropod feeding on invasive and native algae while altering essential energy reserves for organismal homeostasis upon warming
AB  - Marine bioinvasions are of increasing attention due to their potential of causing ecological and economic loss. The seaweed Gracilaria vermiculophylla has recently invaded the Baltic Sea, where, under certain conditions, it was found to outcompete the native alga Fucus vesiculosus. Parasites of grazers and temperature are among the potential factors which might indirectly modulate the interactions between these co-occurring algae through their single and combined effects on grazing rates. We tested the temperature and parasitism effects on the feeding of the gastropod Littorina littorea on F. vesiculosus vs. G. vermiculophylla. Uninfected and trematode-infected gastropods were exposed to 10, 16, 22, and 28 Â°C for 4 days while fed with either algae. Faeces production was determined as a proxy for grazing rate, and HSP70 expression, glycogen and lipid concentrations were used to assess the gastropod's biochemical condition. Gracilaria vermiculophylla was grazed more than F. vesiculosus. Trematode infection significantly enhanced faeces production, decreased glycogen concentrations, and increased lipid concentrations in the gastropod. Warming significantly affected glycogen and lipid concentrations, with glycogen peaking at 16 Â°C and lipids at 22 Â°C. Although not significant, warming and trematode infection increased HSP70 levels. Increased faeces production in infected snails and higher faeces production by L. littorea fed with G. vermiculophylla compared to those which fed on F. vesiculosus, suggest parasitism as an important indirect modulator of the interaction between these algae. The changes in the gastropod's biochemical condition indicate that thermal stress induced the mobilization of energy reserves, suggesting a possible onset of compensatory metabolism. Finally, glycogen decrease in infected snails compared to uninfected ones might make them more susceptible to thermal stress. Â© 2022

TI  - POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF IRON FERTILIZATION IN THE SOUTHERN OCEAN ON ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION
AB  - Recently, it was proposed (Baum, 1990 and Martin et al., 1990a, 1990b) that the southern ocean should be fertilized with iron to stimulate biological productivity, thus enhancing the flux of organic carbon from surface to depth, thereby lowering the concentration of inorganic carbon in surface water and in turn the atmospheric CO2 concentration. We explore the possible impact of a hypothetical iron fertilization on atmospheric CO2 levels during the next century using a high-latitude exchange/interior diffusion advection model. Assuming as an upper-limit scenario that it is possible to stimulate the uptake of the abundant nutrients in the southern ocean, the maximum atmospheric CO2 depletion is 58 ppm after 50 years and 107 ppm after 100 years. This scenario requires completely effective Fe fertilization to be carried out over 16\% of the world ocean area. Sensitivity studies and comparison with other models suggest that the errors in these limits due to uncertainties in the transport parameters, which are determined by calibrating the model with radiocarbon and validated with CFC-11 measurements, range from-29\% to +17\%. If iron stimulated biological productivity is halted during the six winter months, the additional oceanic CO2 uptake is reduced by 18\%. Possible changes in surface water alkalinity alter the result of iron fertilization by less than +9\% to-28\%. Burial of the iron-induced particle flux as opposed to remineralization in the deep ocean has virtually no influence on the atmospheric response for the considered time scale of 100 years. If iron fertilization were terminated, CO2 would escape from the ocean and soon cancel the effect of the fertilization. The factors which determine the atmospheric CO2 reduction most strongly are the area of fertilization, the extent to which biology utilizes the abundant nutrients, and the magnitude of future CO2 emissions. The possible effect of fertilizing the ocean with iron is small compared to the expected atmospheric CO2 increase over the next century, unless the increase is kept small by means of stringent measures to control CO2 emissions.

TI  - Hybrid gas turbine-organic Rankine cycle for seawater desalination by reverse osmosis in a hydrocarbon production facility
AB  - Despite water scarcity, the use of industrial waste heat for seawater desalination has been limited in the Middle East to date. This study evaluates the technical and economic feasibility of integrating on-site gas turbine power generation and reverse osmosis equipment for the production of both electricity and fresh water in a coastal hydrocarbon production facility. Gas turbine exhaust gas waste heat is recovered using an intermediate heat transfer fluid and fed to an organic Rankine cycle evaporator, to generate mechanical power to drive the reverse osmosis high pressure pump. Six candidate organic working fluids are evaluated, namely toluene, benzene, cyclohexane, cyclopentane, n-pentane and R245fa. Thermodynamic and desalination performance are assessed in the harsh climatic and salinity conditions of the Arabian Gulf. The performance metrics considered incorporate electric power and permeate production, thermal and exergy efficiency, specific energy consumption, system size, and permeate quality. Using toluene in the bottoming power cycle, a gain in power generation efficiency of approximately 12% is achieved relative to the existing gas turbine cycle, with an annual average of 2260 m3/h of fresh water produced. Depending upon the projected evolution of local water prices, the investment becomes profitable after two to four years, with an end-of-life net present value of 220-380 million USD, and internal rate of return of 26-48%.

TI  - Climate proofing island energy infrastructure systems: Framing resilience based policy interventions
AB  - One of the most discernible impacts of climate change is the increasing severity and unpredictability of extreme weather conditions. Small island developing states are particularly vulnerable to these conditions, with one of the impacts being on energy supplies due to damaging energy infrastructure, resulting in power outages and economic losses. Drawing on resilience theory to frame the discourse, we present an updated overview of how island energy infrastructures have been and continue to be negatively impacted. This same framework also provides a lens through which we identify the challenges involved in recovery, rebuilding and returning energy security in these contexts.

TI  - Subsea solutions in the pre-salt development projects
AB  - This paper presents the technical solutions adopted and implemented to develop the Brazilian pre-salt reservoirs, covering the main aspects of the subsea production systems already installed and in operation, that allowed overcome the challenges and turn the ultra deepwater pre-salt production into a reality that currently produces more than seven hundred thousand barrels per day. The characteristics related to this particular ultra deepwater scenario are presented, highlighting the ones that demanded to push the envelope of the available technological solutions, considering the conditions are more severe than typical ones from the previous experience with Campos Basin development projects: presence of CO2 and H2S contaminants in the produced fluids; higher internal pressure; high CO2 content gas injection; deeper waters and more severe metocean conditions. The aspects related to subsea trees, control systems, subsea manifolds, diverless connection systems, subsea flowlines, umbilicals and risers for the production systems are presented, as well as the flow assurance issues. The risers and pipelines for produced gas flow to shore are also covered. Considering the large number of projects that would be required to develop the Brazilian pre-salt province, different riser system solutions were developed and applied, being now field proven and available for the industry. Several firsts and records were established and are presented. The effort related to subsea equipment standardization, to cope with the large number of systems to be installed, is also part of this paper. Similarly to the situation of Campos Basin in the 80's, playing the role of a big laboratory for technology development towards deep water production, Brazilian pre-salt scenario, and specially Santos Basin pre-salt province, is nowadays the site where technology development is taking place for ultra deepwater production of high GOR oil with variable CO2 content. Subsea systems are enabling such production and this technology enhancement will contribute for the future development of other areas with similar characteristics.

TI  - Potential of sub-seafloor CO2 geological storage in northern South China Sea and its importance for CCS development in South China
AB  - The South China, especially Guangdong Province, as the most developed area of China emitted large CO2 from energy consumption and industrial production, actively advocates low-carbon development strategies. As an effective option to reduce CO2 emissions, CCS is potentially an effective option to reduce CO2 emissions to low-carbon economy development of South China, especially to Guangdong province. The CO2 storage potential in sedimentary basins onshore South China is limited as previous indicated. So the potential of sub-seafloor CO2 storage in offshore basins would be important. According to the assessment in this paper, large sedimentary basins offshore in the northern SCS have huge CO2 storage potential. Miocene deltaic, coastal plain, and neritic clastic rocks in these basins contain high-porosity and high-permeability aquifers and excellent seals. The estimated effective storage capacity, which is 2.6\% of the theoretical capacity, is similar to 300 GtCO(2) in PRMB, similar to 57 GtCO(2) in BBGB, similar to 41Gt CO2 in QDNB and similar to 160Gt CO2 in YGHB. On the whole, the Tertiary sedimentary basins in northern SCS margin have large storage capacities of abut 567Gt CO2, which provide a promising storage option for CCS implementation in South China. As the high costs is a major obstacles for sub-seafloor CO2 storage, the reuse of infrastructures for oil and gas development, such as platforms, wells and pipelines, would be the first choice. Although the theoretical storage capacities of the offshore oil and gas fields in the northern SCS are small, they distributed as groups and clusters and associated with sufficient quantified CO2 storage capacity in the saline aquifers. Further assessments are needed to define the residual life (= equipment life minus the field life) of the infrastructures, their practical and matched storage capacities, as well as a proper character and site screening particularly in regard to containment and risk of leakage. All these have been done well ahead of the real abandons of the oil/gas fields, so that the fields are in ``CO2 Storage Readiness (CSR){''}. (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - On the potential contribution of microfungi to the decomposition of reed leaf detritus in a coastal lagoon: A laboratory and field experiment
AB  - The potential contribution of microfungi to reed decomposition in a coastal habitat (Le Cesine Lagoon, Italy) was investigated under laboratory and field conditions. Leaf pack mass and surface loss, ergosterol content and O 2 uptake were used to construct carbon budgets and an empirical ergosterolto-O2 uptake relationship based on literature data was used to estimate the contribution of microfungi. Under laboratory conditions, reed carbon loss was entirely due to leaching and microbial respiration. In contrast, C losses observed in the field were accounted for by microbial respiration and macroinvertebrate shredding almost equally. Microfungi were estimated to account for 98% and 69% of microbiallyrespired carbon under laboratory and field conditions, respectively. Our results provide a preliminary, quantitative assessment of microfungal contribution to reed decomposition in brackish habitats. Â© 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

TI  - Dry repair technology for offshore pipelines
AB  - Effective and economical servicing of offshore oil and gas pipelines is vital for the exploitation of the worlds ocean resources. Service methods and instrumentation for offshore pipelines are different from those on land because of their vastly differing performance and environments. Offshore pipe repair technology can be considered in two categories: underwater repair and on-surface repair. Underwater repair is further divided into dry repair and wet repair. A variety of service technologies appropriate for offshore pipelines were introduced and discussed in this paper, particularly research on dry repair technology. Underwater pipeline dry repair systems, financed by national 863 program of China, is aimed to provide technical means for dry repair of oil and gas pipelines and piles. The primary device of the system is typically an underwater hyperbaric chamber, with other accessory devices such as a tapping and plugging machine, specialized tools, a hyperbaric welding machine, and so on. This project to improve underwater pipeline dry repair systems was successfully finished. The repair technology has been given broad patent protection and is a breakthrough in competing with overseas companies for pipeline service contracts.

TI  - Fish beyond fillets: Life cycle assessment of cross-processing herring and lingonberry co-products into a food product
AB  - The food industry generates side streams that can be used as sources of valuable compounds. We carried out a life cycle assessment of a protein ingredient obtained by pH-shift processing co-products of herring (Clupea harengus) and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) pomace. The assessment was based on a combination of primary and literature data to assess climate change, cumulative energy demand, land occupation, and depleted stock fraction impacts of marine resources. We analyzed the environmental profile of the fish protein ingredient on its own and as a consumable fish ball preparation. The potential impacts of the protein ingredient fish ball were compared with a benchmark fish ball and with salmon fillets. The results were generally favorable for the protein ingredient fish ball produced via cross-processing herring co-products and lingonberry pomace. This analysis supports the idea of further investment in cross-processing food sidestreams into a protein ingredient for food products. Â© 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - Successful offshore application of acid tunneling technology: overcoming the difficulties of high depths, temperatures, and deviations
AB  - Field applications of acid tunneling technology began in late 2005 in the Mara Field of Western Venezuela as an alternative to both initial new well stimulation and producing well maintenance. In this field, acid tunneling is used to treat sections of formation in an open hole completion that have been severely damaged from invasion of muds, cements and/or fluid loss control material in an attempt to interconnect the microfractures present in dual porosity carbonate formations. Since the initial trial,.thirteen wells have been successfully treated with this technique; obtaining long term production increases. The large majority of wells situated in the Mara Field exhibit the same two primary conditions: shallow average depths around 6000 ft and temperatures around 200 Â°F.A logical step in the development process of this technique would be to successfully apply the process in areas outside of Venezuela and with more stringent wellbore conditions. This paper outlines the operational procedures and subsequent results from the successful implementation of the acid tunneling process in an offshore, open hole completed well located on the Casablanca Platform in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore Spain. A hydraulic kick-off tool and a specially designed jetting assembly were deployed on coiled tubing to create a single lateral hole in a carbonate reservoir using hydrochloric acid as the treatment fluid. This was the first implementation of the acid tunneling process outside of Venezuelan borders. It was also the first application in a well with a depth greater than 7,000ft and a bottomhole temperature greater than 200 Â°F. Finally, it marked the first time the process was used on an offshore well. The well characteristics, the operational procedures, and the improvements made to the acid tunneling tools for this project are discussed. Copyright 2008, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - CCS MONITORING BY INVERSION OF RESERVOIR PRESSURE AND SATURATION CHANGES FROM TIMELAPSE AVO DIFFERENCES AND TIME-SHIFTS
AB  - The main storage-related challenges for accelerated deployment of CCS are capacity, confidence and cost. These challenges are to be addressed by amongst others focusing on improving strategies for monitoring and management of the pore pressure distribution in the CO2 storage reservoir. Pressure-driven decision support protocols are to be developed for safe and cost-effective reservoir monitoring. These protocols will enable the operator to maximize CO2 storage capacity and quickly turn monitoring data which suggest non-conformance into plans for corrective actions. A new extended method is developed for inverting and de-noising reservoir pressure and water saturation changes from timelapse AVO differences and time-shifts for the purpose of CCS monitoring and conformance. Detailed reservoir pressure and saturation fronts are obtained for 4D data in the Norwegian offshore, honoring reservoir compartments and fault boundaries found in comparative studies. Application on a CCS candidate field offshore Norway is currently being researched in a synthetic study for purposes of benchmarking, pre-storage analysis, monitoring plans and conformance studies. If back-estimation of pressure and saturation changes is successful, the results for field data become substantially more credible and allow for 4D seismic history matching.

AB  - Grassland carbon capturing and storage (CCS) is thought to benefit from regulation of grazing. The impact is likely to depend on livestock density. Yet, few studies have tested this principle or evaluated the consistency of grazer-carbon relationships across multiple sites. We sampled four intertidal zones across 22 salt marshes along a 650 km stretch of coast in the UK to examine the impact of livestock density on globally important saltmarsh ``blue carbon{''} stocks. Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts. Our work suggests that grazing effects on carbon stocks are minimal on broader scales in comparison with the influence of environmental context. The benefits of grazing management to carbon stores are likely to be highly context dependent.

TI  - A review of multi-attributes decision-making models for offshore oil and gas facilities decommissioning
AB  - With the development of the offshore fossil energy industry, the designing life of many offshore oil and gas facilities will end. The decommissioning of these facilities has become an urgent task due to unpredictable costs, high risks, and environmental protection issues of public concern. Decision-making, as the core in the pre-decommissioning stage, plays a decisive role in the cost, risk, and impact of the entire decommissioning. Therefore, the multi-attribute decision-making model has attracted much attention from industry and academia. An efficient, accurate, and simply using multi-attribute decision-making model can enable governments, energy companies, other marine users, and environmental protection organizations to reasonably fulfill their concerns. It is of great significance to all parties. This review mainly studies the multi-attribute decision-making models that have been used in the decommissioning of offshore oil and gas facilities, and conducts a more detailed interpretation of them, including the relevant regulations, frameworks, methodology, preferences and advantages and disadvantages of different models. In addition, a more comprehensive review of the cost assessment model, an important part of the decision-making model, is carried out, including the general framework and methodology of the cost assessment model, and the accuracy of the models is explored. And then the current evaluation method of accuracy of the cost assessment model raises the author's personal doubts. At the end of the article, this paper names two core problems of the current decision-making model, that is, the lack of basic data and the incomplete MCDA (Multi-criteria Decision Analysis) method. This review can provide a comprehensive reference and feasible research directions for future scholars who aims to study the decommissioning of offshore oil and gas facilities especially in the North Sea in the UK and point out the direction for the industry to improve its current multi-attribute decision-making models.

TI  - Study on dynamic characteristics of hydraulic pumping unit on offshore platform
AB  - A new technology of offshore oil rod pumping production is developed for offshore heavy oil recovery. A new type of miniature hydraulic pumping unit with long-stroke, low pumping speed and compact structure is designed based on the spatial characteristics of offshore platforms. By combining the strengths of sinusoidal velocity curve and trapezoidal velocity curve, a kinematical model of the acceleration, the velocity and displacement of the pumping unitâ€™s hanging point is established. The results show that the pumping unit has good kinematic characteristics of smooth motion and small dynamic load. The multi-degree-of-freedom dynamic model of the single-well pumping unit is established. The first and second order natural frequencies of the sucker rod string subsystem and the pumping unit subsystem are studied. The results show that the first and the second order natural frequencies among the pumping rod string, pumping unit-platform subsystem and the dynamic excitation have differences over 5 times from each other, indicating that resonance phenomenon will not appear during the operation and the dynamic requirements for field use are met in the system.

TI  - Saving the Planet with Appropriate Biotechnology: 5. An Action Plan [Salvando el planeta con biotecnologÃ­a apropiada: 5. Un plan de acciÃ³n]
AB  - We evaluate suggestions to harness the ability of calcifying organisms (molluscs, crustacea, corals and coccolithophore algae) to remove permanently CO2 from the atmosphere into solid (crystalline) CaCO3 for atmosphere remediation. Here, we compare this blue carbon with artificial/industrial Carbon dioxide Capture & Storage (CCS) solutions. An industrial CCS facility delivers, at some cost, captured CO2, nothing more. But aquaculture enterprises cultivating shell to capture and store atmospheric CO2 also produce nutritious food and perform many ecosystem services like water filtration, biodeposition, denitrification, reef building, enhanced biodiversity, shoreline stabilisation and wave management. We estimate that a mussel farm sequesters three times as much carbon as terrestrial ecosystems retain. Blue carbon farming does not need irrigation or fertiliser, nor conflict with the use of scarce agricultural land. Blue carbon farming can be combined with restoration and conservation of overfished fisheries and usually involves so little intervention that there is no inevitable conflict with other activities. We calculate that this paradigm shift (from 'shellfish as food' to 'shellfish for carbon sequestration') makes bivalve mollusc farming and microalgal farming enterprises, viable, profitable, and sustainable, alternatives to all CCUS industrial technologies and terrestrial biotechnologies in use today.

TI  - Methane-Derived Carbon as a Driver for Cyanobacterial Growth
AB  - Methane, a potent greenhouse gas produced in freshwater ecosystems, can be used by methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) and can therefore subsidize the pelagic food web with energy and carbon. Consortia of MOB and photoautotrophs have been described in aquatic ecosystems and MOB can benefit from photoautotrophs which produce oxygen, thereby enhancing CH4 oxidation. Methane oxidation can account for accumulation of inorganic carbon (i.e., CO2) and the release of exometabolites that may both be important factors influencing the structure of phytoplankton communities. The consortium of MOB and phototroph has been mainly studied for methane-removing biotechnologies, but there is still little information on the role of these interactions in freshwater ecosystems especially in the context of cyanobacterial growth and bloom development. We hypothesized that MOB could be an alternative C source to support cyanobacterial growth in freshwater systems. We detected low Î´13C values in cyanobacterial blooms (the lowest detected value âˆ’59.97â€° for Planktothrix rubescens) what could be the result of the use of methane-derived carbon by cyanobacteria and/or MOB attached to their cells. We further proved the presence of metabolically active MOB on cyanobacterial filaments using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) based activity assay. The PCR results also proved the presence of the pmoA gene in several non-axenic cultures of cyanobacteria. Finally, experiments comprising the co-culture of the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon gracile with the methanotroph Methylosinus sporium proved that cyanobacterial growth was significantly improved in the presence of MOB, presumably through utilizing CO2 released by MOB. On the other hand, 13C-CH4 labeled incubations showed the uptake and assimilation of MOB-derived metabolites by the cyanobacterium. We also observed a higher growth of MOB in the presence of cyanobacteria under a higher irradiance regime, then when grown alone, underpinning the bidirectional influence with as of yet unknown environmental consequences.

TI  - Climate and Security in Asia and the Pacific (Food, Water and Energy)
AB  - The impacts of increasing natural climate disasters are threatening food security in the Asia-Pacific region. Rice is Asiaâ€™s most important staple food. Climate variability and change directly impact rice production, through changes in rainfall, temperature and CO2 concentrations. The key for sustainable rice crop is water management. Adaptation can occur through shifts of cropping to higher latitudes and can profit from river systems (via irrigation) so far not considered. New opportunities arise to produce more than one crop per year in cooler areas. Asian wheat production in 2005 represents about 43 % of the global total. Changes in agronomic practices, such as earlier plant dates and cultivar substitution will be required. Fisheries play a crucial role in providing food security with the contribution of fish to dietary animal protein being very high in the region â€“ up to 90 % in small island developing states (SIDS). With the warming of the Pacific and Indian Oceans and increased acidification, marine ecosystems are presently under stress. Despite these trends, maintaining or enhancing food production from the sea is critical. However, future sustainability must be maintained whilst also securing biodiversity conservation. Improved fisheries management to address the existing non-climate threats remains paramount in the Indian and Pacific Oceans with sustainable management regimes being established. Climate-related impacts are expected to increase in magnitude over the coming decades, thus preliminary adaptation to climate change is valuable. Water security has become a defining issue of the twenty-first century for Asia and the Pacific. In the case of the Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau (HTP) region, cross-border conflicts over international water rights have also led to increased geopolitical tensions. For the Pacific, the main sources of freshwater for island communities is very limited being constrained to rainwater, surface water and groundwater. There is a need for a range of effective water management strategies for dealing with water security issues ranging from more effective water governance through to enhanced community participation. Flood disasters are the most frequent and devastating and their impacts have grown in the region. For longer term disaster risk reduction planning procedures are required as integral elements for â€˜good governanceâ€™ of floods. Energy security in three major energy-consuming economies in Asia; namely China, India and Japan is crucial, and requires climate change mitigation policies. Both energy efficiency and renewable energy are important factors in solutions to the energy conundrum. Technological innovation and diffusion is an important component for improving energy efficiency, with the promotion of renewable energy requiring financial investment and innovation. However, costs of new technologies are likely to decrease as they become more widely adopted. Demand side management is also need to provide key solutions.

TI  - Round Robin Assessment of Radar Altimeter Low Resolution Mode and Delay-Doppler Retracking Algorithms for Significant Wave Height
AB  - Radar altimeters have been measuring ocean significant wave height for more than three decades, with their data used to record the severity of storms, the mixing of surface waters and the potential threats to offshore structures and low-lying land, and to improve operational wave forecasting. Understanding climate change and long-term planning for enhanced storm and flooding hazards are imposing more stringent requirements on the robustness, precision, and accuracy of the estimates than have hitherto been needed. Taking advantage of novel retracking algorithms, particularly developed for the coastal zone, the present work aims at establishing an objective baseline processing chain for wave height retrieval that can be adapted to all satellite missions. In order to determine the best performing retracking algorithm for both Low Resolution Mode and Delay-Doppler altimetry, an objective assessment is conducted in the framework of the European Space Agency Sea State Climate Change Initiative project. All algorithms process the same Level-1 input dataset covering a time-period of up to two years. As a reference for validation, an ERA5-based hindcast wave model as well as an in-situ buoy dataset from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service In Situ Thematic Centre database are used. Five different metrics are evaluated: percentage and types of outliers, level of measurement noise, wave spectral variability, comparison against wave models, and comparison against in-situ data. The metrics are evaluated as a function of the distance to the nearest coast and the sea state. The results of the assessment show that all novel retracking algorithms perform better in the majority of the metrics than the baseline algorithms currently used for operational generation of the products. Nevertheless, the performance of the retrackers strongly differ depending on the coastal proximity and the sea state. Some retrackers show high correlations with the wave models and in-situ data but significantly under- or overestimate large-scale spectral variability. We propose a weighting scheme to select the most suitable retrackers for the Sea State Climate Change Initiative programme.

TI  - Quantifying blue carbon for the largest salt marsh in southern British Columbia: implications for regional coastal management
AB  - Understanding blue carbon storage and accumulation prior to engineering projects is essential for assessing the potential co-benefit of carbon storage for natural climate solutions. This study collected sediment cores from the western portion of Boundary Bay, Delta, British Columbia (BC), where implementation of a living dike pilot project is planned to alleviate impacts of sea level rise. Total carbon stocks were 10,034 +/- 3,148 Mg C for the western 140 ha of marsh, with stocks averaging 83.3 +/- 29.3 Mg C/ha (high marsh) and 39.3 +/- 24.2 Mg C/ha (low marsh). Carbon accumulation rates (CARs) exhibited substantial variability, ranging from 19.5 to 454 g C/m(2)/yr (median 70.1 g C/m(2)/yr). Both stocks and accumulation rates were at least 45\% lower than globally averaged estimates, likely due to the shallow depth and dominant vegetation type of the marsh. Despite historical modifications to the marsh, our study indicates that the western marsh has expanded by about 20\% since 1930, which we estimate increased carbon stocks by about 1,549-1,698 Mg C. This study's quantification of carbon stocks and CARs is an important first step towards leveraging the co-benefit of salt marshes for improved management, restoration, and preservation. However, additional data are needed to document the greenhouse gas budgets for carbon accounting purposes, along with exploration of law and policy issues related to carbon stewardship in a multi-jurisdictional coastal environment. We outline subsequent research needed for salt marshes such as Boundary Bay to be included in voluntary carbon markets in British Columbia.

TI  - Lloyd's Register puts the case for LNG
AB  - The pros and cons of LNG, according to Tom Boardley, marine director at Lloyd's Register, are presented. Compared to heavy fuel oil, the primary technical case for LNG is that it is a clean burning fossil fuel. The regulatory requirement to reduce SO x and NO x and particulate emissions can be met using LNG as a marine fuel. Another benefit of LNG is that in the context of Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) on the basis of tank to flue onboard an EEDI ship, the use of LNG as a marine fuel could enable the requirements to be more easily met or exceeded. Other technical benefits include cleaner engines and engine room environment. The case for LNG as a marine fuel requires much more caution where there are claims being made for its potential to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions from shipping and, to enable widespread global use, the fact that a bunkering infrastructure needs to be established. If LNG is to be a globally available fuel for shipping then a global market for LNG and a bunker network will need to be developed.

TI  - Bioturbation determines the response of benthic ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms to ocean acidification
AB  - Ocean acidification (OA), caused by the dissolution of increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in seawater, is projected to cause significant changes to marine ecology and biogeochemistry. Potential impacts on the microbially driven cycling of nitrogen are of particular concern. Specifically, under seawater pH levels approximating future OA scenarios, rates of ammonia oxidation (the rate-limiting first step of the nitrification pathway) have been shown to dramatically decrease in seawater, but not in underlying sediments. However, no prior study has considered the interactive effects of microbial ammonia oxidation and macrofaunal bioturbation activity, which can enhance nitrogen transformation rates. Using experimental mesocosms, we investigated the responses to OA of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms inhabiting surface sediments and sediments within burrow walls of the mud shrimp Upogebia deltaura. Seawater was acidified to one of four target pH values (pH(T) 7.90, 7.70, 7.35 and 6.80) in comparison with a control (pH(T) 8.10). At pH(T) 8.10, ammonia oxidation rates in burrow wall sediments were, on average, fivefold greater than in surface sediments. However, at all acidified pH values (pH <= 7.90), ammonia oxidation rates in burrow sediments were significantly inhibited (by 79-97\%; p < 0.01), whereas rates in surface sediments were unaffected. Both bacterial and archaeal abundances increased significantly as pHT declined; by contrast, relative abundances of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidation (amoA) genes did not vary. This research suggests that OA could cause substantial reductions in total benthic ammonia oxidation rates in coastal bioturbated sediments, leading to corresponding changes in coupled nitrogen cycling between the benthic and pelagic realms.

TI  - Hybrid Positioning System for Improving Location Recognition Performance in Offshore Plant Environment
AB  - In case of an accident, location information is important for initial response. Therefore, in this paper, Hybrid positioning system-based location recognition technology for the safety of offshore plant workers is proposed. Generally, The zone based positioning using Zigbee communication has advantages for hardware cost and maintenance cost. The proposed Hybrid positioning system based positioning provides enhanced positioning accuracy by combining fingerprint results with weighted centroid localization positioning results to identify worker positions in the zone. In addition, deck information of workers is provided by the LF antenna. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed HPS based positioning technology will be applied for the safety of offshore plant workers.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of lateral carbon export from an onshore aquaculture farm
AB  - Many coastal areas are hotspots of aquaculture expansion, where the overuse of artificial feeds results in the accumulation of organic carbon in nearshore aquaculture ponds. In rural areas, wastewater from the aquaculture ponds is discharged to the nearshore waters through artificial ditches causing lateral carbon export from the land to the ocean. Such flux may be meaningful in coastal carbon budgets since aquaculture is the hotspot of carbon sequestration and storage. To quantify the magnitude and temporal dynamics of lateral carbon export from aquaculture ponds, we used high-frequency in-situ monitoring of turbidity, fluorescent dissolved organic matter, etc. across different temporal scales. We measured water levels and velocity profiles in a ditch cross-section to obtain year-round water exchange. Carbon export was integrated from water fluxes and organic carbon concentrations. Our results suggested that aquaculture ponds were a source of particular organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The net lateral flux of POC and DOC was 148 Â± 38 kg yrâˆ’1 and 296 Â± 18 kg yrâˆ’1. Temporally, the export of POC and DOC is influenced by both tides and wastewater discharge. Under the disturbance with aquaculture wastewater discharge, the mean DOC export in the ditch increased by 497 kg, which was 1.5 times that of the undisturbed; the mean POC export increased by 190 kg, which was 1.8 times that of the undisturbed. Thus, aquaculture activities can considerably disturb the coastal carbon balance by facilitating carbon-rich fluid exchange from onshore farms to nearshore estuaries. As aquaculture expands across Asia and the globe, this study provides important insights into the impacts of aquaculture on coastal carbon budgets. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Benefits and risks of including the bromoform containing seaweed Asparagopsis in feed for the reduction of methane production from ruminants
AB  - The agricultural production of ruminants is responsible for 24\% of global methane emissions, contributing 39\% of emissions of this greenhouse gas from the agricultural sector. Strategies to mitigate ruminant methanogenesis include the use of methanogen inhibitors. For example, the seaweeds Asparagopsis taxiformis and Asparagopsis armata included at low levels in the feed of cattle and sheep inhibit methanogenesis by up to 98\%, with evidence of improvements in feed utilisation efficiency. This has resulted in an increasing interest in and demand for these seaweeds globally. In response, research is progressing rapidly to facilitate Asparagopsis cultivation at large scale, and to develop aquaculture production systems to enable a high quality and consistent supply chain. In addition to developing robust strategies for sustainable production, it is important to consider and evaluate the benefits and risks associated with its production and subsequent use as an antimethanogenic feed ingredient for ruminant livestock. This review focuses on the relevant ruminal biochemical pathways, degradation, and toxicological risks associated with bromoform (CHBr3), the major active ingredient for inhibition of methanogenesis in Asparagopsis, and the effects that production of Asparagopsis and its use as a ruminant feed ingredient might have on atmospheric chemistry.

TI  - Towards an intensified summer CO2 sink behaviour in the Southern Ocean coastal regions
AB  - The Southern Ocean is a globally important carbon sink region. However, the austral coastal zones are usually not considered in global estimations due to their general undersampling and large regional dynamics. Thus, estimations of carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean may differ considerably from current values, i.e., without accounting for coastal regions. Here, we conducted a case study in the Gerlache Strait, an ecologically important Antarctic coastal zone. We show that the net sea-air CO2 flux (FCO2) in the strait may reach the same or greater magnitudes than those in large open sea regions around Antarctica during summer, despite having a much smaller area. A large mean FCO2 of -31 +/- 19 mmol m(-2) d(-1) was observed in the strong CO2 sink years (i.e., FCO2 < -12 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), in contrast to -1 +/- 7 mmol m(-2) d(-1 )in CO(2 )near-equilibrium conditions (i.e., CO(2 )sea-air difference approximate to 0). This variability is mainly modulated by phytoplankton activity and likely upwelling processes. We also identified two cycles of variability with 2-year and 4-year periodicities from 1999 to 2017. The 2-year periodicity becomes stronger after 2012, intensifying the strong CO2 sink scenario in the Gerlache Strait. Our findings reinforce the importance of polar coastal zones as CO(2 )sinks during the austral summer and the need to broaden our understanding of the role of these regions at other time scales.

TI  - Carbon sharing through physiological integration in the threatened seagrass Halophila johnsonii
AB  - Carbon sharing among ramets of the clonal marine angiosperm Halophila johnsonii Eiseman was investigated in plants collected from Biscayne Bay, Florida, USA, and cultured in a seawater-supplied greenhouse facility in Wilmington, North Carolina. Different ramets along four-ramet segments (genets) were shaded for 3 d. At the end of the shading period, neighboring ramets were supplied with (NaHCO3)-C-14, (5 mu Ci) to determine rates of carbon fixation and patterns of carbon allocation. The direction and degree of carbon support among ramets were determined by employing whole-plant autoradiography and scintillation spectrophotometry. Genets with shaded ramets were not statistically different in terms of carbon uptake per gram dry weight than genets with un-shaded ramets, suggesting that genet carbon uptake is unaffected by shading. Autoradiograms indicated a trend towards H. johnsonii allocating more carbon to younger parts of the genet. However, scintillation analysis showed no significant directionality in photosynthate allocation to ramets with respect to age or shading. Photosynthate was allocated to ramets proportional to their proximity to the source ramets rather than because of the condition of the neighboring ramets. The fast turnover and short lived deterministic leaves of H. johnsonii suggest that no advantage may be gained by selectively supporting ramets based on condition or age. The physiological strategy we describe indicates that H. johnsonii does not support stressed ramets along its genet. Along with this species' low capacity for storage, our data suggest that vegetative growth over large unsuitable patches may be unlikely and that H. johnsonii's ability to recover from widespread habitat loss may be limited.

TI  - Comparison of Marine Technologies for Mediterranean Offshore Gas Export
AB  - This paper aims at identifying the most viable marine technology to transport natural gas in a Mediterranean Sea scenario. Pipeline, LNG, SSLNG, and CNG solutions are put in competition. Techno-economic modelling of each technology is performed to evaluate corresponding capex and opex. To highlight which of the competitive transportation modes offers the minimum supply chain cost through a discounted cash flow model, estimations of the total cost of investment, shipping, and operation tariff were taken as primary attribute in the ranking process. Number of LNG, SSLNG and CNG ships are developed at conceptual design level and stored in databases which feed the optimal composition of fleets, also to compete with subsea pipeline projects whose main technical and cost parameters are available from different sources. Pipeline and LNG cost reductions are considered to make uniform comparison of these technologies with ready advances in CNG technology. The comparative results on the Zohr-Brindisi route show that the CNG marine solution is economically the most advantageous transport mode provided lighter pressure vessels are fitted on CNG ships.

Combined with a project of aquatic environment monitoring and assessment of marine shellfish in Zhejiang province, China, a new structure of WSN combining network clustering and route enhancing is proposed with the aim at facilitating node deployment in offshore and tidal zone and regular network maintenance. The topology of wireless sensing cluster, hard- and soft- design of wireless node and routing enhancement are elaborated. The testing result shows that the proposed scheme has the capability of robust data transmission. The method proposed in the paper is also suitable for other water quality monitoring system.

TI  - Invasive Spartina alterniflora can mitigate N2O emission in coastal salt marshes
AB  - Although there are studies on nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes in coastal salt marshes, temporal and spatial variations of this greenhouse gas are still uncertain. Especially salt marshes of the East China Sea coast covered by invasive Spartina alterniflora have shown controversial results. To analyse seasonal patterns of N2O fluxes and their relationship with environmental factors, three plots dominated by S. alterniflora, and differing in sediment salinity and vegetation history (P1, P2, P3), and one bare mudflat (P0) in a salt marsh of Nanhui shore in the southern fringe of Yangtze River estuary have been established. Monthly studies from March 2017 to January 2018 using a chamber technique showed that average N2O fluxes from all four plots ranged from -41.9 to 39.3 mu g N2O.m(-2).h(-1), whereas average flux (4.2 mu gN(2)O.m(-2).h(-1)) in P1, P2 and P3 was not significantly different from that measured in P0 (1.3 mu gN(2)O.m(-2).h(-1)). There was a clear seasonal difference: in spring and summer, all the sites showed slight emission while consumption prevailed in autumn and winter. In vegetated sites this trend was more remarkable than in the bare mudflat. N2O flux showed positive correlation (p <.05) with air and sediment temperature, and plant development (height of vegetation). Nitrate was not the limiting factor of N2O emission in the Yangtze estuary. In the salt marsh where vegetation community was mature, higher sediment salinity reduced N2O emission (P1 < P2) by influencing other environmental factors such as total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN) content and sediment texture. In comparison with other tidal macrophytes S. alterniflora showed relatively low N2O emission. Therefore, it can be considered as a species for tidal zone stabilisation.

TI  - Energy efficiency for OSVs
AB  - The LNG carrier and Offshore Support Vessel (OSV) markets are the two segments of the maritime industry that continue to remain buoyant and attract a lot of investment and new orders. LNG carriers' day rates continue to surge ahead and are currently at over $150,000 per day, while the OSV segment, depending on vessel features, is averaging rates of $30,000 a day. Meanwhile, all OSV operators need to be aware of the environmental considerations involved in running their fleets. Today, the shipping industry has an annual carbon dioxide emission level equivalent to that of the entire nation of Germany. In March 2010, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) amended the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), designating specific portions of North America as an ECA, and this will become enforceable in August 2012. The EEDI is a set of targets for specific ship types against which new buildings will be benchmarked.

TI  - Advanced ERD lower completion technology performance update in a giant offshore field UAE
AB  - Earlier, SPE Technical Paper 193036 introduced the development, testing, qualification and deployment of plugged liner technology in Extended Reach Drilling (ERD) field re-development from artificial islands of a giant offshore field in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This paper will highlight the excellent well performance of the two pilot wells and other island wells with this technology deployment and the significant impact of this technology on initial production rates as well as reservoir recovery. Plugged LEL technology utilizes Dissolvable Plugged Nozzle Assemblies (DPNA) for deployment with Limited-Entry-Liner lower completions combined with Remote Close Shoes (RCS). The technology results in about 5 days of rig-time saving in well displacement process in extremely long laterals, switching from the non-aqueous reservoir drilling fluid to an aqueous completion brine, by eliminating the use of a dedicated liner displacement string. Two pilot wells with extra-long horizontal laterals in the very low permeability region were completed with plugged LEL utilizing (1) 169 DPNA 4-mm in 28 zones isolated by swell-packers and (2) 183 DPNA 4-mm in 24 zones isolated by swell-packers. The distribution and location of the DPNA holes along the liner are designed in-house with ExxonMobil proprietary software. After successful deployment of the plugged liner in two pilot wells which resulted in significant CAPEX reduction upfront through reduced duration for well construction, the well performance was monitored closely in order to assess the success of the technology application in terms of production and reservoir objective. The production rates from both pilot wells exceeded the expected production rates. Apart from total production rate, the critical component of this technology was to ensure all the dissolvable nozzles that plug the liner have dissolved across the lateral enabling lateral conformance which is key to initial production rate and reservoir recovery. Thus, production logging tool (PLT) was performed and the results indicated that the entire extended production lateral is contributing to flow. Apart from well construction cost savings, this technology also enables enhanced wellbore cleaning and improved filter-cake breaker placement. These enhancements resulted in improved well performance than expected and lateral conformance which maximizes reservoir recovery from horizontal wells. After the success of the first two pilot wells, field-wide deployment of the plugged liner was initiated and several wells have been completed with this technology. This paper will demonstrate the success of the first global deployment of a novel lower completion technology - plugged nozzles LEL - to maximize production and recovery in ERD wells with very long laterals. Value and impact of this technology will be presented in terms of well performance, reservoir recovery in addition to previously highlighted well construction cost savings.

TI  - North Sea offshore network and energy storage for large scale integration of renewables
AB  - This review investigates different aspects of the realization of a North Sea offshore grid. The North Sea region has several characteristics that make large-scale integration of renewable energy sources attractive, such as large wind resources and huge hydro reservoirs in the North. A meshed offshore grid with underwater storage can contribute to facilitate sufficient flexibility in the system. The technical review reveals some aspects that need more research, particularly regarding the protection schemes. Furthermore, offshore storage solutions are under development. However, most other aspects are covered by readily available solutions. The greatest challenges seem to lie within standardization, cost-benefit sharing and harmonization of regulatory regimes of the surrounding countries. Nevertheless, several studies have shown highly promising economic benefits of establishing an offshore grid in the North Sea compared to traditional planning of point-to-point connections only.

TI  - Organic carbon burial and sources in soils of coastal mudflat and mangrove ecosystems
AB  - Mangrove organic carbon is primarily stored in soils, which contain more than two-thirds of total mangrove ecosystem carbon stocks. Despite increasing recognition of the critical role of mangrove ecosystems for climate change mitigation, there is limited understanding of soil organic carbon sequestration mechanisms in undisturbed low-latitude mangroves, specifically on organic carbon burial rates and sources. This study assessed soil organic carbon burial rates, sources and stocks across an undisturbed coastal mudflat and mangrove hydrogeomorphological catena (fringe mangrove and interior mangrove) in Bintuni Bay, West Papua Province, Indonesia. Pb-210 radionuclide sediment dating, and mixing model of natural stable isotope signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and C/N ratio were used to estimate organic carbon burial rates and to quantify proportions of allochthonous (i.e., upland terrestrial forest) and autochthonous (i.e., on-site mangrove forest) organic carbon in the top 50 cm of the soil. Burial rates were in the range of 0.21-1.19 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1). Compared to the fringe mangroves, organic carbon burial rates in interior mangroves were almost twice as high. Primary productivity of C3 upland forest vegetation and mangroves induced soil organic carbon burial in interior mangroves and this was consistent with the formation of the largest organic carbon stocks (179 +/- 82 Mg C ha(-1)). By contrast, organic carbon stored in the fringe mangrove (68 +/- 11 Mg C ha(-1)) and mudflat (62 +/- 10 Mg C ha(-1)) soils mainly originated from upland forests (allochthonous origin). These findings clearly indicate that carbon sequestered and cycling in mangrove and terrestrial forest ecosystems are closely linked, and at least a part of carbon losses (e.g., erosion) from terrestrial forests is buried in mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Concept stage site assessments, deepwater development risks, and long-term value preservation: Why getting it right the first time is more important than ever
AB  - Concept stage site assessments based on exploration 3D seismic data and other existing information are critical elements in the deepwater field development sequence. Such assessments help create value by defining site conditions and geohazards that may eventually constrain development, which in turn allows risks to be properly evaluated before significant development decisions are made. Several decades of deepwater development consulting experience, however, have shown that-despite their great value-concept stage site assessments are often not undertaken because 1) decision makers do not know that the assessments should or could be performed, or 2) there is a misconception that money can be saved by skipping steps or executing steps out of sequence in order to fast-track a development. As shown by way of two examples, decisions not to perform concept stage site assessments-even in cases where the necessary data are already available and free of additional cost-can be expensive mistakes that result in project delays if surveys have to be repeated or field layouts changed. In other words, human decision makers become significant and-unlike those associated with geohazards-largely indefinable elements of risk if short-term savings accrued by doing it wrong the first time are prioritized while the potentially more significant costs of having to do it right the second time are marginalized.

TI  - Internet of things for marine aquaculture
AB  - In order to maintain good environment of marine aquaculture media, water quality monitoring is essential. In this paper, we proposed an IoT system to support marine aquaculture system. The system can remotely monitor the water quality, such as turbidity, pH, temperature as well as environment humidity. The system consists of end-node, cloud server and dashboard system. The end-node is device that directly placed in measured area, while for communication to the gateway, a long range and low power communication system (LoRa) is employed. In addition, cloud server is employed to record the measured data, which further sent to the dashboard, that could provide a meaningful information of the measured data. The system also has energy harvester by utilizing solar cell system. In order to prove system functionality, the system has been tested by performing experimental evaluation of the designed system, such as reading various sensors and remotely displayed using dashboard system.

TI  - An experimental investigation into quantifying CO 2 leakage in aqueous environments using chemical tracers
AB  - Chemical tracers can be an effective means of detecting, attributing and quantifying any leaks to the surface from geological CO 2 stores. CO 2 release experiments have found it difficult to ascertain the fate, or quantify the volume of CO 2 without the application of tracers. However, a significant proportion of global CO 2 storage capacity is located offshore, and the marine environment poses constraints that could limit the success of using tracers. These constraints include uncertainties in the behaviour of tracers in marine sediments and the water column and sampling challenges. However, to date there have been few experimental investigations to address these uncertainties. Here, we used a benchtop experimental setup to explore how effectively methane, a common constituent of captured CO 2 and of reservoir fluids, can aid the quantitation of CO 2 leakage in aqueous environments. The experiment simulated gas leakage into sediments that mimic the seabed, and we measured the partitioning of co-released gases under different environmental conditions and injection rates. We find that the style of seepage and the fate of the CO 2 are affected by the presence of a sand layer and the injection rate. We discuss the implications for leak monitoring approaches, including how tracers may be used to quantify the leak rates and fate of CO 2 in aqueous environments. Our work contributes to ongoing efforts to develop robust offshore monitoring system that will assure operators, regulatory bodies and the public of CO 2 storage integrity. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sequestration of carbon dioxide by ocean fertilization
AB  - Sequestration of carbon dioxide to the deep ocean by the fertilization of high nutrient, low chlorophyll (HNLC) ocean waters can be an answer to tile concerns arising from the increasing carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. This approach has the potential to sequester about 400,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide by repeated episodic fertilizations of the Pacific equatorial current for a cost of about \$2.00/ton of carbon dioxide and for 1000 to 2000 years. A technology demonstration is planned to fertilize an area of 5,000 square miles of the equatorial Pacific that is expected to sequester between 600,000 and 2,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide in a period of 20 days. The ecological changes expected consist of the increase in diatoms, which double or triple each day until the limiting fertilizing element is used up. No adverse changes are expected, since this is exactly what happens naturally when episodic fertilization occurs in the open ocean. The concept is that fertilization of HNLC waters with chelated iron will cause a bloom of phytoplankton that sink below the thermocline into deep water due to their high density after they die. The experiment, while large by land comparisons, is small in terms of ocean area, about one square degree at the equator. The demonstration protocol will include measurements of the amount of carbon dioxide that is removed from the surface layer and the amount of organic carbon that is produced and exported to the ocean depths as well as other effects in the water column over a period of 20 days. After this time no further effects of iron fertilization are expected to take place because macronutrient elements (N, P and Si) are depleted to limiting concentrations. Since tile iron enrichment is transient, no steady-state modification of the food web will occur. The experiment will be carried out outside the EEZ of any nation, as were the previous five experimental voyages, so, like them, no permits will be required. The five recent ocean experiments observed iron stimulation of phytoplankton growth, but the effects were difficult to quantify in the 9 to 28 square mile experiments since eddy diffusion along the edges of the patch diluted the bloom. This problem will be minimized in the planned technology demonstration because its larger area restricts the diffusion from the center of the patch to less than 2\% of the concentration over the 20 day period of the test.

TI  - International Maritime Organization and Decarbonization of Maritime Industry: Mandate and Instruments
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) makes a crucial contribution to the decarbonization of the maritime industry within the United National Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) objectives. The IMOâ€™s mandate provides for many activities to reduce CO2 emissions from international shipping, including imposing binding and non-binding instruments. The regulations on energy efficiency for ships play a critical role in implementing this IMO strategy. The article examines the conditions of Chapter 4 of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annex VI. It focuses on the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) as a non-administrative mechanism and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) as the operational activity. This article also covers the legal aspects of international cooperation, the dissemination of energy-efficient technologies in the maritime sector, and the IMOâ€™s contribution to the Norway GreenVoyage2050 project to promote MARPOL rules in national legislation.

TI  - CO2 capture from the industry sector
AB  - It is widely accepted that greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2, must be significantly reduced to prevent catastrophic global warming. Carbon capture and reliable storage (CCS) is one path towards controlling emissions, and serves as a key component to climate change mitigation and will serve as a bridge between the fossil fuel energy of today and the renewable energy of the future. Although fossil-fueled power plants emit the vast majority of stationary CO2, there are many industries that emit purer streams of CO2, which result in reduced cost for separation. Moreover, many industries outside of electricity generation do not have ready alternatives for becoming low-carbon and CCS may be their only option. The thermodynamic minimum work for separation was calculated for a variety of CO2 emissions streams from various industries, followed by a Sherwood analysis of capture cost. The Sherwood plot correlates the relationship between concentrations of a target substance with the cost to separate it from the remaining components. As the target concentration increases, the cost to separate decreases on a molar basis. Furthermore, the lowest cost opportunities for deploying first-of-a-kind CCS technology were found to be in the Midwest and along the Gulf Coast. Many high purity industries, such as ethanol production, ammonia production and natural gas processing, are located in these regions. The southern Midwest and Gulf Coast are also co-located with potential geologic sequestration sites and enhanced oil recovery opportunities. As a starting point, these sites may provide the demonstration and knowledge necessary for reducing carbon capture technology costs across all industries, and improving the economic viability for CCS and climate change mitigation. The various industries considered in this review were examined from a dilution and impact perspective to determine the best path forward in terms of prioritizing for carbon capture. A possible implementation pathway is presented that initially focuses on CO2 capture from ethanol production, followed by the cement industry, ammonia, and then natural gas processing and ethylene oxide production. While natural gas processing and ethylene oxide production produce high purity streams, they only account for relatively small portions of industrial process CO2. Finally, petroleum refineries account for almost a fifth of industrial process CO2, but are comprised of numerous low-purity CO2 streams. These qualities make these three industries less attractive for initial CC implementation, and better suited for consideration towards the end of the industrial CC pathway. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Float-over feasibility in Brazilian sea water
AB  - This paper describes the feasibility of topside float-over installation in Brazilian sea water. Float-over installation, which is the method to install a topside onto a substructure, such as jacket or floating platforms, using a transportation barge or vessel, is becoming more common as crane vessel lifting capacity is limited and not available in certain areas. The main benefit of float-over compared to multi-module lifting installation is relatively short offshore hook-up and commissioning time, reducing offshore exposure hours and cost. The float-over installation method is increasingly becoming the installation method of choice in both mild and harsh environments as topside weight grows. However, the float-over method has never been used in Brazilian sea water mainly due to the unique weather characteristics typically represented by swell. In this study, weather characteristics in several project sites worldwide are analyzed and several workability analyses are performed based on estimated weather limits that are calculated from extensive float-over analyses. The risks and costs related to a float-over installation operation will be a part of an important factor determining topside fabrication philosophy. From this study, the float-over method in Brazilian sea water is found to be feasible when using specific supporting structure design such as surge/sway fenders, Leg Mating Unit/Deck Support Units (LMU/DSU) and mooring system. Although workability in the Brazilian sea water is relatively lower than other regions due to swell conditions, there is plenty of room to improve the workability by introducing float-over systems designed specifically for swell dominant area.

TI  - Benthic community establishment on different concrete mixtures introduced to a German deep-water port
AB  - Concrete is a widely used building material in coastal constructions worldwide. However, limited natural resources used in the production process, as well as high CO2-emission due to the calcination process of limestone and the thermal energy demand for Portland cement clinker production, raise the demand for alternative constituents. Alternative mixture types should be environmentally friendly and, at best, mimic natural hard substrates. Here five different concrete mixtures, containing different cements (Portland cement and blast furnace cements) and aggregates (sand, gravel, iron ore and metallurgical slags) were made. Three replicate cubes (15 x 15 x 15 cm) of each type were then deployed in a German deep-water Port, the JadeWeserPort, to study benthic community establishment after one year. Results are compared to a similar experiment conducted in a natural hard ground environment (Helgoland Island, Germany). Results indicate marked differences in settled communities in the Port site compared to natural environments. At the Port site community composition did not differ with the concrete mixtures. Surface orientation of the cubes (front/top/back) revealed significant differences in species abundances and compositions. Cubes hold more neobiota in the Port site than in natural hard ground environments. Implications for the usage of new concrete mixtures are discussed.

TI  - A universal field development approach for advancing stalled GOM deepwater projects
AB  - Following the oil price collapse in mid-2014, the number of deepwater projects with a floating production host platform sanctioned in the GOM plunged to historic lows. In this period only three projects were sanctioned, Stampede (2014), Appomattox (2015) and Mad Dog 2 (2017). During this time cost compression across the industry reduced the average breakeven project costs from $70 per barrel to $45- $50 per barrel for many, but not all deepwater projects. An additional 10%-15% reduction in breakeven costs is required to get these stalled projects to a final investment decision. The industry is assessing and implementing many different strategies to achieve these additional cost efficiencies that include standardization, simplification, technology, collaboration and creative financing. Many of these are being addressed at a component level rather than at a field development level. A universal field development approach for deepwater GOM projects requiring a host platform is proposed that entails using the same building blocks for a majority of field developments that will: Provide a universal field development solution that accommodates a range of reservoir types, sizes and complexities Maximize flexibility for field layout, phased development and contracting options Reduce project delivery uncertainty, as universality facilitates standardization and repeatability Significantly improve discovery to First Oil cycle time while adapting to changing reservoir information during the development phases This paper presents a universal field development approach together with specific standardization and simplification recommendations of its key component building blocks; floating host platform and subsea system. Taken together these will provide the additional break even cost reduction, project cycle time improvement and increased certainty of project delivery to enable operators' to confidently sanction a greater number of stranded deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects than is currently possible.

TI  - Determinants of household fuelwood collection from mangrove plantations in coastal Bangladesh
AB  - The Government of Bangladesh has been establishing mangrove plantations since 1960. This study analyzes results from a household survey across eight coastal villages to investigate how local rural communities utilize these resources. The predominant direct use by households is the extraction of combustible fuel. Econometric results suggest that determinants of the household decision to collect fuelwood include respondent occupation and village. Farmers are less likely to extract mangrove fuels due to the availability of substitutes such as agricultural residues, and are also less likely obtain non-mangrove fuelwood via market purchase. Collection quantities are positively correlated with degree of impoverishment, with poorer households significantly less likely to access non-mangrove fuelwood markets. These results are robust to selection bias, spatial lag dependence, and spatial error dependence, and have important policy implications for beneficiary selection for future mangrove plantations.

The drivers of the shift are identified, concentrating on solar PV power and the potential for offshore wind power. Like other countries in East Asia similarly pursuing a green shift, Taiwan is as much concerned with the business and export prospects for green industry as with reducing carbon emissions. The argument is developed that further progress in Taiwan is linked to liberalization of the electric power sector, creating genuine competition for the quasi-monopoly, TaiPower.

There have been many challenges with respect to long term operation of such pipes, in many cases with the need to replace or repair before the end of the initial design life. The number of identified failure mechanisms and observed failure events is also increasing. The objective of the present paper is to describe the steps required in order to be able to extend the lifetime of a flexible riser for the case of corrosive annulus environments.

TI  - Spatiotemporal evolution of carbon sequestration vulnerability and its relationship with urbanization in China's coastal zone
AB  - Carbon sequestration plays a vital role in maintaining the stability of global climate and the carbon cycle, but is undergoing significant changes due to urbanization. This study proposes the concept of carbon sequestration vulnerability (CSV), and explores the spatiotemporal evolution of CSV and its relationship between urbanization in China's coastal zone from 2000 to 2010. The study results provide a scientific basis for government management and policy-making. The results showed that the average amount of CSV in 2000 and 2010 was 0.301 and 0.279, respectively, in China's coastal zone and exhibited obvious spatial heterogeneity. Land urbanization had better interpretation strength for CSV than population and economic urbanization indexes, and could explain the 10-year change in CSV well in China's coastal zone. In China's coastal zone from 2000 to 2010, CSV response to land urbanization was proven to be positive and linearly increasing, and the slope of the linear relationship was 0.4214, cities with high land urbanization level have higher CSV; likewise, the change in land urbanization level had a significant positive and linear relationship with the change in CSV, and the slope of the linear relationship was 0.5031. When the city's land urbanization level increased by <6.8% over ten years, the CSV declined, and conversely, the CSV rose. For the goal of reduce CSV of cities, government and policy-makers should focus on land urbanization and it is possible to realize the goal by controlling land urbanization below 6.8% every ten years.

TI  - COGENERATIVE PERFORMANCE OF A WIND - GAS TURBINE - ORGANIC RANKINE CYCLE INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR OFFSHORE APPLICATIONS
AB  - Gas Turbines (GT) are widely used for power generation in offshore oil and gas facilities, due to their high reliability, compactness and dynamic response capabilities. Small heavy duty and aeroderivative units in multiple arrangements are typically used to offer larger load flexibility, but limited efficiency of such machines is the main drawback. A solution to enhance the system performance, also in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) arrangement, is the implementation of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) systems at the bottom of the gas turbines. Moreover, the resulting GT-ORC combined cycle could be further integrated with additional renewable sources. Offshore wind technology is rapidly developing and floating wind turbines could be combined with offshore GT-ORC based power plants to satisfy the platform load. The pioneering stand alone power system, for an oil and gas platform, examined in this paper comprises a 10 MW offshore wind farm and three gas turbines rated for 16.5 MW, each one coupled with an 4.5 MW ORC module. The ORC main parameters are observed under different wind power fluctuations. Due to the non-programmable availability of wind and power demand, the part-load and dynamic characteristics of the system should be investigated. A dynamic model of the power system based on first principles is used, developed in the Modelica language. The model is integrated with a time series-based model of two offshore wind mills. Various theimodynamic indexes, available in the literature, are identified and evaluated to compare the actual combined heat and power performances of single components and of the overall integrated system in the considered wind scenarios.

TI  - MODELLING THE EFFECTS OF GLOBAL TEMPERATURE INCREASE ON THE GROWTH OF SALT MARSH PLANTS
AB  - Gradual increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations have resulted from the increased human use of fossil fuels since the beginning of industrial activity. In coastal wetland ecosystems, salt marshes constitute important habitats because they play important ecological roles, acting as carbon sinks by capturing atmospheric CO2 and storing it in living plant tissue. Ecological models are important tools for understanding the results of anthropogenic impacts on a global scale. Global warming poses threats to salt marshes through different effects, e.g., increases in sea level. The objectives of this study were i) to assess how temperature increases will influence the growth of salt marsh plants, ii) to infer the carbon budget of salt marshes under temperature increase scenarios and iii) to predict how salt marsh plants will keep pace with increases in sea level. These goals were achieved by developing growth models of three different plants (Spartina maritima, Scirpus maritimus and Zostera noltei) found in the Mondego estuary. Models were developed for C-3 and C-4 plant species. The results suggest that a temperature increase enhances the aboveground biomass of salt marsh plants. According to the predictions of the models, the sedimentation rate of S. maritima and Z. noltei can keep pace with increases in sea level, but this is apparently not the case for S. maritimus. If S. maritimus disappears from the Mondego estuary, the carbon sequestration ability of the system should decrease due to the loss of active plant tissue. This conclusion is based on the fact that S. maritimus accumulated more than 80\% of the total carbon sequestered in the tissues by the three studied species.

TI  - Thermodynamic Modeling of a Seawater-Cooled Foldable PV Panel System
AB  - Solar-powered systems can supply clean and sustainable energy for both service requirements and also for the propulsion of marine vessels. However, the restricted available area for photovoltaic panels and high setup costs inhibits the sufficient energy production for satisfying the whole needs of vessels. Due to the limited panel area that can be installed on the vessel, it is necessary to improve the system efficiency in order to obtain more power from the existing solar panel system. In this study, cooling solar panels from the back surface with seawater in an open loop cooling water circuit for a 527-W solar-powered system are investigated. In order to observe the effects of cooling the panels, thermodynamic modeling and analysis of a foldable photovoltaic panel set have been carried out. The result illustrates the potential of these systems as the power output difference of the panel set is more than the consumed power for cooling on above-specific irradiation conditions. The remaining power output, which would be up to 37\% of the uncooled system, is high enough to be utilized to speed up the marine vessels or to increase their range.

TI  - Comparative study of a hybrid research vessel utilizing batteries or hydrogen fuel cells
AB  - The Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) current coastal/local research vessel, the R/V Robert Gordon Sproul, is nearing the end of its service life and will soon require replacement. This study compares three potential variants for an R/V Sproul replacement vessel (SRV): a Baseline SRV consisting of a traditional diesel-electric powertrain, a Battery Hybrid SRV (battery/diesel-electric) and a Hydrogen Hybrid SRV (hydrogen fuel cell/diesel-electric). All three variants meet the science mission requirements of the SRV but with varying levels of zero-emission runtime, energy efficiency and emissions. The Battery Hybrid SRV can provide 2.5 h of zero emissions (battery only) operation, but could not complete any of the identified SRV science missions without also engaging the diesel generators. In contrast, the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV can provide 23.4 h of zero emission (hydrogen only) runtime, and can complete 74% of the SRV science missions solely with zero-emission operation. The superior performance of the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV is attributable to the higher volumetric energy storage density of the LH2/fuel cell combination. The capital costs of these vessels are estimated to be: âˆ¼ $21.4 M for the diesel-electric Baseline SRV, âˆ¼ $26.0 M for the Battery Hybrid SRV vessel and âˆ¼ $34.4 M for the Hydrogen Hybrid SRV. The â€œwell-to-wavesâ€ (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant emissions were estimated using various sourcings for the diesel fuel, electricity and hydrogen fuel. The lowest emission levels are achieved with the Hydrogen Hybrid variant using 100% renewable hydrogen. The annual WTW GHG emissions from the Hydrogen Hybrid using renewable LH2 in combination with fossil diesel in the hybrid arrangement yields a 26.7% GHG emissions reduction from the Baseline vessel using fossil-derived diesel fuel. The Battery Hybrid vessel with 100% renewable electricity combined with diesel fuel provides a 6.9% reduction in GHG emissions. Similar results are seen for the criteria pollutant emissions. The hybrid vessels are also compared with regard to operational safety. The study reveals that hydrogen fuel-cell technology provides an effective hybrid supplement to diesel power for a coastal/local research vessel. Â© 2021

TI  - Application of solidified sea bottom sediments into environmental bioremediation materials
AB  - Since dredged sea bottom sediments normally give off a horrible smell, the limitation of disposal places has become a serious problem in Japan. Hence, development of an alternative system to readily treat dredged sea bottom sediments is therefore needed. The development of ``value-added'' reused products from these sediments offers particular benefits both in terms of resource recovery and protection of the environment. We developed an in situ solidification system for the treatment of sea bottom sediments, the ``Hi-Biah-System (HBS)''. Firstly, this review deals with solidified sea bottom sediments for the construction of an artificial tidal flat in Ago Bay, Japan. The environmental conditions (pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), acid volatile sulphide (AVS), loss on ignition (LOI), water content (WC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (T-N), chlorophyll a and particle size) were then monitored in the constructed tidal flat. The number of benthos individuals and growth of short-necked clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) in the artificial tidal flat were also evaluated. The environmental conditions, number of benthos individuals and growth of short-necked clams in the artificial tidal flat were shown to be similar to those observed in a natural tidal flat. Next, the potential use of solidified sea bottom sediments as soil parent material in the germination/growth of seagrass is presented. The soil parent material consisting of solidified sediments obtained using HBS plus soil conditioner and hardener seems to be effective for the germination of Zostera marina. The best growth after six months was observed in plants grown in soil parent material consisting of a mixture of solidified sediments and the sand by weight ration 70:30. The present study may suggest the possible application of solidified sea bottom sediments into growth of other plants.

TI  - Positive Effects on Alfalfa Productivity and Soil Nutrient Status in Coastal Wetlands Driven by Biochar and Microorganisms Mixtures
AB  - Biochar application in reclaiming degraded soils and improving plant productivity has been recognized as a promising technology. Yet, the impacts of biochar and mixtures with compound effective microorganisms (CEM) on alfalfa growth and soil quality in coastal wetlands are poorly understood. A greenhouse experiment was set to systematically reveal the impacts of biochar and biochar combined with CEM on alfalfa growth traits, nutrient uptake, biomass, soil quality, and enzyme activities. Eight treatments were included: (1) control (CK-CEM), (2) 10-g/kg biochar (B-10-CEM); (3) 20-g/kg biochar (B-20-CEM); (4) 30-g/kg biochar (B-30-CEM), (5) CEM without biochar (CK + CEM); (6) 10-g/kg biochar with CEM (B-10 + CEM), (7) 20-g/kg biochar with CEM (B-20 + CEM), (8) 30-g/kg biochar with CEM (B-30 + CEM). The utilization of biochar promoted seed germination, height, and tissue nutrient contents of alfalfa, and the combined biochar with CEM showed greater effects. Alfalfa biomass showed the maximum value in the B-20 + CEM treatment, and the biomass of root, shoot, leaf in the B-20 + CEM treatment increased by 200, 117.3, 144.6\%, respectively, relative to the CK-CEM treatment. Alfalfa yield in the CK + CEM, B-10 + CEM, B-20 + CEM, B-30 + CEM treatments was 71.91, 84.11, 138.5, and 120.5\% higher than those in the CK-CEM treatment. The use of biochar and CEM decreased soil salinity and elevated soil nutrient content effectively. Biochar elevated soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), NH4+, NO3-, and enzymatic activities, and the positive impacts of biochar combined with CEM were additive. The combined addition of 20-g/kg biochar with CEM showed the pronounced improvement effects on improving soil fertility and nutrient availability as well as soil enzyme activities. Path analysis indicated that the application of biochar mixture with CEM promoted alfalfa biomass by regulating plant nutrient uptake, soil quality (soil nitrogen, SOC, MBC, NH4+, NO3-), and soil enzymatic activities (sucrase, urease, and alkaline phosphatases). Thus, incorporation of suitable biochar and CEM can serve as an effective measure to promote alfalfa productivity and restore coastal wetlands soils.

TI  - Marooned: How island power systems keep the lights on
AB  - Puerto Rico almost went underwater financially because its electric utility was overloaded with debt stemming from high-cost oil and old equipment. About 68% of its power, from five main power plants, is oil-based; 15% comes from LNG; 15% is from coal; and about 2% is from hydro. To combat the high cost of electricity, a number of island nations or territories are seeking alternatives. Hawaii leads the nation in the adoption of distributed solar. Diversification of island power portfolios may also be achieved with the integration of natural gas, according to EIA. LNG has been an option for many islands because it is typically shipped in bulk carriers in quantities far too large for island economies to absorb. Puerto Rico and Hawaii are separately testing the economics of small-scale LNG imports, evaluating whether LNG prices justify switching away from diesel and residual fuel oils. The Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority had achieved a 20% reduction in fossil fuel energy consumption by implementing several renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives. These include 8.2 Mw of solar through partnerships with Toshiba International Corp and Mainstreet Power Co. Some more innovative ways islanders are generating power while rejecting costly diesel imports are presented.

TI  - Challenges to transboundary fisheries management in North America under climate change
AB  - Climate change is shifting the distribution of fish stocks that straddle between exclusive economic zones (EEZ), challenging transboundary fisheries management. Here, we examine the projected sharing of jointly managed transboundary fish stocks between Canada and the United States. We hypothesize that ocean warming will alter the sharing of fish stocks between the two countries, and that such changes will intensify under a high carbon emission scenario. We look at the specific cases of the International Pacific Halibut Commission that manages Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) and a resource sharing arrangement in the Gulf of Maine for cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), and yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) to discuss the management consequences of shifts in transboundary stocks. We rely on multiple Earth system models' simulations and species distribution models to estimate the change in catch potential and stock share ratio of each transboundary stock in the 21st century under two climate change scenarios. Results show that, even under a low emission scenario, most transboundary fish stocks sharing ratios, i.e., the proportion of the total catch of a fish stock taken by a given country, will change by 2050 relative to present. The overall reduction in catch potential, in addition to the changes in stock-share will further exacerbate trade-offs between changes in species catch potential. Such trade-offs in the Atlantic and Pacific regions will be amplified if a high emission scenario is followed, relative to a low carbon emission scenario. Based on the simulation results, we examine possible solution options to reduce climate risks on transboundary fish stocks and fisheries.

TI  - Feature 2: Green ship technology: Viking Lady steals the limelight
AB  - Viking Lady, the world's first ever fuel cell ship, arrived at the heart of Copenhagen, Germany, in the middle of the one of the most significant climate conferences ever held and was displayed as a signal of change. Viking Lady is also a working ship supplying oil platforms in the North Sea. Meeting the needs of an increasingly climate conscious world the supply vessel has many advantages, it operates largely on four 2 mw LNG main engines and, for research purposes has a 320 kw fuel cell on deck, which is used for auxiliary power providing heat and electrical energy for the crew accommodation block. The vessel has reduced CO2 emissions by up to 50%, NOx, SOx, and particulate emissions were totally eradicated and fuel efficiency was improved by 30%. In addition, the LNG engines give a vibration free ride onboard the vessel so that even when the ship is docking and the engines are run at high power to slow the vessel the vibration levels are remarkably low. This benefits the crew who can rest more easily and are then refreshed for their shifts during work hours. According to the Fellowship, the capital costs of a fuel cell/LNG powered vessel is 10% higher than a conventional vessel, which means that charter rates for the ships will be higher, but operational costs significantly lower and that lowers the overall costs over an extended period.

TI  - Ocean acidification leads to counterproductive intestinal base loss in the gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta)
AB  - Oceanic CO2 has increased from 280 to 380 Î¼atm since preindustrial times and is expected to reach 1,900 Î¼atm by 2300. In addition, regional upwelling zones exhibit levels up to 2,300 matm, making exploration at future global projected CO2 levels ecologically relevant today. Recent work has demonstrated that CO2 exposure as low as 1,000 Î¼atm induces acidosis in toadfish (Opansus beta), leading to metabolic compensation by retention of blood in an effort to defend pH. Since increaseHCO-3 serosal HCO-3 translates to increased HCO-3 secretion rates in isolated intestinal tissue, we predicted that blood elevation of and Pco2uring exposure to 1,900 Î¼atm CO2 HCO-3 would increase in vivo base secretion rates. Rectal fluid and CaCO3 excretions were collected from toadfish exposed to 380 (control) and 1,900 Î¼atm CO2 for 72 h. Fluids were analyzed for pH, osmolality, ionic composition, and total CO2. Precipitated CaCO3 was analyzed for titratable alkalinity, Mg2+, and Ca2+ content. Fish exposed to 1,900 Î¼atm CO2 exhibited higher rectal base excretion rates, higher rectal fluid HCO-3 (mmol L-1), and lower fluid Cl- (mmol L-1) than controls, suggesting increased intestinal anion exchange as a result of the compensated respiratory acidosis. This study verifies that imminent projected CO2 levels expected by the year 2300 lead to greater HCO-3 intestinal loss, a process that acts against compensation for a CO2- induced acidosis.

TI  - Fiber-metal hybrid laminated material solution for shipbuilding and offshore renewable energy devices
AB  - For the next generation of offshore renewable energy devices and new ships designs, operators are looking to safer technologies, specifically those which create an optimum floating structures for energy devices (waves, wind, tidal) and safer and lighter designs for shipbuilding. MaleconÂ© is a new materials for offshore structures and new naval design, capable of satisfying all these design and fabrication requirements for lighter structures that are in turn more resistant, permit higher devices and more sustainable technology. Steel has a series of limitations that impede continued improvement in the line of constructing light, resistant and safe structures. Composite materials are light and resistant, but the manufacturing processes are more labor-intensive and costly; in addition they are very sensitive to damage from impact and can present problems of degradation of their mechanical properties through water absorption. Fiber-metal hybrid materials combine the high resistance to impact and durability, and the versatile manufacturing of metals with a specific strength and stiffness in the direction of the fiber, as well as good resistance to fatigue, characteristics of the composites. MaleconÂ© is a new hybrid multilayered material formed by layers of metal alternating with others of composite and structural adhesives, with improved in-service performance. This material and its manufacturing system is patented internationally. Â© Associazione Italiana di Tecnica Navale.

TI  - Deepstar 11901: Subsea low salinity injection water for increased oil recovery
AB  - This paper is based on work performed for Deepstar CTR11901 (for more information on the program see www, deepstar. or gl. On average, only a third of in-place oil is recovered in Miocene reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico. Water injection has been used to enhance the oil recoveries with limited success. Low salinity water injection could potentially further increase the oil recoveries achievable through seawater injection. For deepwater oil fields and those requiring long tie-backs to the existing host processing platforms, local subsea processing systems providing low salinity water injection could be useful in improving development economics. A Deepstar study has been carried out to evaluate the existing technologies for such subsea processing system to generate the low salinity from the seawater at 10,000 feet of water depth. Several conceptual process schemes have been defined and evaluated, employing various combinations of technologies, and compared from the point of view of operability, maintainability and technology maturity level. Technology gaps have been identified in the selected technologies and roadmaps have been defined to fill those gaps. The paper describes the methodology that has been used to review the existing technologies for water treatment and evaluate their potential for subsea application, presents the main results of the state of the art review and gives an overview of four process schemes defined for subsea implementation of a low salinity water injection station. Whole range of technologies for water desalination have been studied including membranes, electro-dialysis and the use of hydrate formation. The defined schemes combine desalination with other function technologies in order to optimize the make-up of the low salinity water to meet the particular reservoir needs.

TI  - Acoustic Impedance Inversions for Offshore CO2 Storage: South Georgia Embayment, United States
AB  - This study builds and expands on previous CO2 storage resource assessment studies of the southeastern offshore Atlantic margin by providing a detailed evaluation on how rock porosities and permeabilities are distributed across the Upper Cretaceous strata restricted to the South Georgia Embayment (SGE). Using legacy industry two-dimensional seismic reflection and well data, this assessment is the first application of multiple seismic inversion techniques in this area. This workflow provides a reliable and repeatable model-based inversion which gives an improved image to discriminate lithology and predict porosity. The workflow is applicable to future CO2 storage resource assessment studies elsewhere. The inversion results indicate that distinct porosity and permeability regimes are present and distributed in the Upper Cretaceous strata within the SGE. The impedance and porosity relationships show well-founded and reliable correlation. These relationships reveal low impedance coincident to the high porosity intervals which are proposed as potential reservoir intervals for CO2 storage. In addition, the result shows that the Upper Cretaceous strata have two main potential reservoirs in the lower part. These are overlain by a thick impermeable interval, mostly shale, which has high impedance, low porosity, and low permeability and extends within the SGE. This result is in agreement with a previous study that also proposed two significant storage reservoirs for CO2 in the Upper Cretaceous strata. Since porosity distribution is estimated using multiple methods, it follows the trends of seismic signature and structures of the Upper Cretaceous strata. The extracted values of porosity, ranging from 15 to 36\%, and permeability, ranging from 1 to 100 mD, are close to the measured values from the well core data at the Upper Cretaceous strata interval.

TI  - Design case study for a 4 MTPA FLNG system for severe metocean conditions
AB  - Floating LNG is gaining acceptance as a viable alternative to conventional land based LNG plants. In the past few years, several FLNG projects have become commercial and reached FID. However, most FLNG systems designed to date remain complex, costly and operationally limited to areas with benign to moderate metocean conditions that allow side-by-side offloading of the LNG. This paper describes a "Split Process" FLNG design where primary production and gas treatment functions are provided on a host platform while liquefaction occurs on a separate vessel(s). The arrangement works in moderate to severe metocean operating conditions, such as offshore Western Australia or the Grand Banks of Eastern Canada, and is scalable from 1-6 MTPA. The design and features of a 4 MTPA, deepwater case study are described. Salient features of the concept include: â€¢ Segregation on separate facilities of gas processing/condensate storage from liquefaction/LNG storage â€¢ Improved safety, constructability and overall project schedule â€¢ Use of existing, standard hull designs for host facility and liquefaction vessels â€¢ Pre-cooled Dual N2 expansion liquefaction for safety, simplicity and operability â€¢ Dual fuel diesel electric (DFDE) power to improve fuel efficiency â€¢ No offloading of LNG in open water; all offloading takes place in sheltered water Process improvements have been made to the Dual N2 expansion liquefaction (DNX) process to reduce the unit liquefaction power. Fuel consumption for liquefaction is further reduced by the higher efficiency DFDE prime movers over gas turbines. The system offers lower capital cost and improved operability over conventional, integrated designs. Eliminating offshore LNG transfer and achieving fuel efficiency on N2 liquefaction similar to mixed refrigerant (MR) processes contribute to reliable/cost effective operations. The liquefaction vessel is derived from a standard DFDE Moss LNG carrier which is extended 42 ft. at the bow to add a liquefaction module, switchgear and disconnectable turret mooring. Additional power generation is added to drive the 2 MTPA liquefaction unit. The liquefaction vessel disconnects when full and transits to a transfer jetty in sheltered water to offload. A fleet of 3 X 2 MTPA dedicated liquefaction vessels provides continuous operation and total system capacity of 4 MTPA. A host platform, determined by site specific considerations, handles primary production, condensate storage/offloading and treats the gas to an LNG inlet specification. The host may be an FPSO, TLP or fixed platform/FSO depending on upstream field development requirements. The FLNG concept described offers both schedule and cost advantages through the use of standardized hull forms and repetitive, standardized design. Copyright 2016, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Long term behaviour of lateral dynamically loaded steel grout joints
AB  - Grouted steel-cement-steel connections have been used successfully for many decades in the offshore industry. Typical applications are grouting of an offshore pile within a pile sleeve for support of subsea or jacket structures. Such connections are dominated by simple compressive and shear load transfer at the steel boundary via welded shear connectors or well beads on the steel boundary surfaces. The length diameter ratio for such joints have generally been larger than 7. Grouting has also been used for large piles drilled into rock. For lateral loading a length diameter ratio down to 2.5 has been used. The grout used has been simple cement systems. Recent years there has been an increasing use of dynamically loaded grout connections for structures such as offshore windfarms and for sleeve/shaft connections on fixed offshore structures in the oil and gas industry. In general the grout joints have done their jobs. But there are examples of unforeseen behaviour. For instance, slip surfaces have been observed resulting in axial displacements between grout and steel. In more extreme cases gaps have occurred in the grout annulus. The typical length/diameter ratio for these connections is 1.5. Examples of this type of connections and the typical sealing systems are presented in this paper. It is shown that if the stress flow is completely through the grout in a grout joint exposed to bending then there will invariably be created tension stresses, which may debond from the steel surfaces and cause cracks. This can lead to sliding between grout and steel. The cracks may develop further and the grout may ground down to aggregate and pulverized cement. As long as the pulverized grout is confined it will still transfer stresses. If unconfined, for instance due to a detachment of the grout packer, these cracks will further develop and eventually the joint will loose strength. Proposals for strong grout packers are presented.

TI  - Acclimation to a broad range of nitrate strength on a euryhaline marine microalga Tetraselmis subcordiformis for photosynthetic nitrate removal and high-quality biomass production
AB  - Industrial wastewaters usually possess a wide range of nitrate strength. Microalgae-based nitrate-rich wastewater treatment could realize nitrate recovery along with CO2 sequestration for sustainable biomass production, but the low tolerance of the microalgal strains to high-strength nitrate restricted the treatment process. The present study comprehensively evaluated a euryhaline marine microalga Tetraselmis subcordiformis for photosynthetic nitrate removal and biomass production in synthetic wastewater with a broad range of nitrate strength (0.24â€“7.0 g NO3âˆ’-N/L). This alga could acclimate to high nitrate strength up to 3.5 g NO3âˆ’-N/L (HN) without compromising biomass production. Nitrate could be completely removed within four days when low nitrate (0.24 g NO3âˆ’-N/L, LN) was loaded. The maximum nitrate removal rate of 331 mg N/L/day and specific nitrate removal rate of 360 mg N/day/g cell was obtained under medium nitrate condition (1.8 g NO3âˆ’-N/L, MN). High-nitrate stress under 7.0 g NO3âˆ’-N/L (SHN) caused an increased light energy dissipation while decreased the density of photosystem II active reaction center, which partially protect the cells from photodamage and contributed to their acclimation to SHN. The algae also enhanced amino acid/fatty acid proportions essential for maintaining intracellular redox states to cope with the stress caused by LN or SHN. HN and SHN was in favor of protein accumulation and maintenance with enhanced proportion of essential amino acids, which entitled the algal biomass to be of high quality for animal feed applied in livestock graziery and aquaculture. LN facilitated productive starch and lipid accumulation with good quality for biofuels production. The nitrate removal rate and biomass productivity exceeded most of the microalgae reported in literature under similar conditions, which highlighted Tetraselmis subcordiformis as a potent strain for flexible nitrate-rich wastewater remediation coupled with fast CO2 bio-mitigation and high-quality biomass production for sustainable algal biorefinery.

TI  - OPPORTUNITY TO REUSE HYDROCARBON FIELDS AND WELLS IN CO2STORAGE OPERATIONS IN Romania
AB  - Implementation of carbon capture and storage is vital for the reduction of CO2 emissions from industrial sources and for the financial survival of emitters in Romania. Although in the last two decades, a reduction of industrial emissions was seen and the emissions verified for 2019 are almost half of the emissions from 2007, the need to reduce CO2 emissions still exists on the pathway for a green economy and a green energy future. Decarbonizing industry can be made only by increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix and by applying large-scale carbon capture and storage. The CO2 geological storage options for Romania include only deep saline aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon fields. While deep saline aquifers are hard to identify and characterize, since they did not present interest up until now, depleted or almost depleted hydrocarbon fields can present a very good opportunity for the large-scale implementation of CO2 storage and utilization in enhanced recovery operations in Romania. Until present, the only deep saline aquifers identified in Romania for CO2 storage are the two aquifers selected for GETICA CCS project within Getic Depression and the four structures delimited in Histria Depression, Black Sea. More than 150 years of hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation in Romania means in fact that a large number of hydrocarbon fields are depleted or almost depleted. Their structures are very well known, starting from the reservoir to caprock and trapping mechanism. According to public information sources, from a total of more than 700 hydrocarbon fields, less than 50% are producing at the moment and less than 12% are new discovered fields or under development. The remaining fields should therefore be taken into consideration for reuse in CO2 storage and utilization operations. Regarding the issue of reusing wells from Romanian hydrocarbon fields, these could prove to be an opportunity, but also a challenge. The opportunity refers to the large number of wells present, but the challenge is to ensure well integrity at the injection and storage of CO2 for all the wells intercepting the reservoir. It is certain that, due to the long hydrocarbon exploitation history of Romania, the wells were drilled, equipped and abandoned in different decades of the last 150 years, under different regulations. The last decade meant from this point of view implementation of more strict regulations in this field that could provide more confidence in the potential for reuse of wells temporary or permanently abandoned or drilled in this period. The problem of old wells remains still for the old fields where, if storage is envisaged, well integrity should be assured, including through re-abandonment.

In this paper, we propose a decarbonization roadmap for Singapore based on an analysis of Singaporeâ€™s energy landscape and a technology mapping exercise. This roadmap consists of four major components. The first component, which also underpins the other three components, is using centralized post-combustion carbon capture technology to capture and compress CO2 emitted from multiple industrial sources in Jurong Island. The captured CO2 is then transported by ship or an existing natural gas pipeline to a neighboring country, where it will be stored permanently in a subsurface reservoir. Important to the success of this first-of-a-kind cross-border carbon capture and storage (CCS) project is the establishment of a regional CCS corridor, which makes use of economies of scale to reduce the cost of CO2 capture, transport, and injection. The second component of the roadmap is the production of hydrogen in a methane steam reforming plant which is integrated with the carbon capture plant. The third component is the modernizing of the refining sector by introducing biorefineries, increasing output to petrochemical plants, and employing post-combustion carbon capture. The fourth component is refueling the transport sector by introducing electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, using biofuels for aviation and hydrogen for marine vessels. The implications of this roadmap on Singaporeâ€™s energy policies are also discussed. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Steel Catenary Risers (SCRs): From design to installation of the first reel CRA lined pipes. Part II: Fabrication and installation
AB  - As part of the ultra-deepwater field development of the Santos Basin, 300km offshore the Brazilian coast, the Sapinhoa and Lula NE pioneering riser system was successfully installed by Subsea 7, acting as a contractor for Petrobras and partners (BG E&P Brasil and Repsol Sinopec Brasil, in Sapinhoa Field, BG E&P Brasil and Petrogal Brasil, in Lula NE Field). The full Engineering, Procurement, Installation and Commissioning (EPIC) project scope comprises the design, fabrication and installation of 4 buoys of 2800 tons moored 250m subsurface, of which 2 connect to the Floating Production, Storage and Offloading unit (FPSO) Cidade de Sao Paulo and 2 to the FPSO Cidade de Paraty; 27 Steel Catenary Risers (SCRs) with 3.9km each, 27 Pipeline End Terminations (PLETs) and anchorage suction piles at 2140m water depth. This Buoy Supporting Risers (BSR) system concept presents several advantages to overcome the challenges of installing SCRs on ultra-deep waters, such as, allowing decoupling between installation of risers and the production unit, reducing payload on the unit, reduced risks associated with clashes and very small dynamics transmitted from production unit to the risers, resulting in significant less fatigue issues. Due to sour and C02 service requirements for the production and water injection risers, it was decided to use mechanically lined pipe for the entire line, with the exception of the top and touch down sections, where metallurgical clad (metclad) pipe was used. Consequently, a significant amount of qualification, testing and inspection associated to welding lined and metclad pipes was required. In order to install Corrosion Resistant Alloys (CRA) lined pipes with a Reel-Lay vessel, a novel methodology for water pressurized spooling and pipelay was developed to mitigate the risk of liner damage during installation. Full-scale pressurized spooling trials were done ahead of the pipelay campaign for testing and validation of this methodology. In addition, analyses were performed to evaluate the BSR system behaviour during SCRs installation and to minimize buoy de-ballasting interventions. This paper describes the faced challenges and solutions engineered in the steel catenary risers' fabrication and installation scopes.

TI  - Bromwich calls for global cooperation in regulating offshore
AB  - International cooperation will be the key to formulating effective offshore oil and gas regulations worldwide. US Bureau of Offshore Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement Director Michael R. Bromwich has noted that BOEMRE hosted a delegation from Mexico's Hydrocarbon Commission in July to discuss topics including technical data management, production measurement and verification, and regulatory and enforcement programs. Bromwich also described steps which led to US Interior Secretary Ken Salazar's lifting of the deepwater drilling moratorium before its scheduled November 30 expiration. BOEMRE also imposed new rules covering well equipment and workplace safety in September. An October 13 Unified Area Command news release said about 98 miles of Gulf Coast shoreline had moderate to heavy oiling of which 88 miles was in Louisiana, 9 miles in Mississippi, and 1 mile in Florida. The US government is currently exploring ways to partner with industry, academia, and the environmental community to develop a rigorous R&D program.

TI  - Key parameters and influence analysis of Marine S-CO2Brayton cycle power generation system under off-design conditions
AB  - Utilizing the flue gas of ship main engine for waste heat power generation by S-CO2 Brayton cycle is an effective way to realize the energy saving and emission reduction of ships and the greening of the shipping industry. As the load of ship main engine will change under different sailing conditions, leading to changes in the temperature and mass flow of flue gas from the main engine, which makes the overall operating state of the S-CO2 Brayton cycle power generation system change. Reasonable control of turbine inlet temperature, compressor inlet temperature, compressor inlet pressure and flow split ratio is an effective way to ensure a good performance of the S-CO2 Brayton cycle under different states of flue gas. To determine the control objects and controlled parameters of the S-CO2 Brayton cycle under unsteady heat source, the mathematical model of the core components of the system, such as heat exchanger, turbine and compressor, and the steady-state simulation program of the S-CO2 recompression Brayton cycle were established in this paper. Based on analyzing the influence of key thermodynamic parameters on the performance of S-CO2 Brayton cycle, taking maximizing the output power of the system as the objective of optimization, the optimal operating key parameters of the S-CO2 Brayton cycle system under different main engine conditions are determined, which provides a numerical basis for the operation control of marine S-CO2 Brayton cycle power generation system.

TI  - Advances in the utilisation of carbon-neutral technologies for a sustainable tomorrow: A critical review and the path forward
AB  - Global industrialisation and overexploitation of fossil fuels significantly impact greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in global warming and other environmental problems. Hence, investigations on capturing, storing, and utilising atmospheric CO2 create novel technologies. Few microorganisms, microalgae, and macroalgae utilise atmospheric CO2 for their growth and reduce atmospheric CO2 levels. Activated carbon and biochar from biomasses also capture CO2. Nanomaterials such as metallic oxides, metal-organic frameworks, and MXenes illustrate outstanding adsorption characteristics, and convert CO2 to carbon-neutral fuels, creating a balance between CO2 production and elimination, thus zeroing the carbon footprint. The need for a paradigm shift from fossil fuels and promising technologies on renewable energies, carbon capture mechanisms, and carbon sequestration techniques that help reduce CO2 emissions for a better tomorrow are reviewed to achieve the world's sustainable development goals. The challenges and possible solutions with future perspectives are also discussed. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Live-Life cycle assessment of the electric propulsion ship using solar PV
AB  - This paper was born to introduce a novel methodology termed Live-Life Cycle Assessment using a simulation-based data generation technique that can remedy the inherent shortcomings of conventional practices of lifecycle assessment. To demonstrate its excellence, the proposed method was applied to one of the most challenging topics in the marine industry. That was to tackle the fundamental doubt of whether solar-electric propulsion ships could truly be the future energy solution of maritime transports by fulfilling new environmental conventions and goals around the world. The case study began with an existing hybrid short route ferry running on diesel and plug-in battery power. Credible PV systems for the case ship was modelled to produce ship performance data under various operational/environmental circumstances of the coastal zones across 29 countries in the platform of MATLAB/Simulink. As a key functionality of Live-Life Cycle Assessment, the produced data was directly fed, as inputs, into life cycle assessment to avoid conventional practices that heavily rely on outdated data libraries. Results of the case study clearly revealed and quantified the correlations of the performance of PV-battery systems with climate parameters such as temperature and irradiance of subject areas as well as national power production methods. For example, in terms of Global Warming Potential, the case ship with the PV system was estimated to reduce 40,812 kg CO2 eq. per year in Brazil (average temp.: 27.4 â„ƒ, major energy source: hydro). Interestingly, the same vessel was found to achieve greater reductions in India (average temp.: 27.5 â„ƒ, major energy source: coal) or Australia (average temp.: 20.1 â„ƒ, major energy source: coal) where are overly laden with coal-based power plants. Therefore, their reduction levels were estimated at 152,887 kg CO2 eq. per year and 141,517 kg CO2 eq. per year respectively. This paper clearly shows the excellence of the proposed method to demystify/quantify the impacts of parametric variables on the performance of the PV-electric ship. Moreover, it highly suggests the Live-Life Cycle Assessment could be a solution as a new standard to respond to strong demand to obtain general observation of lifecycle benefits/harms of new technologies across all industries, not necessarily limited to the maritime sector.

TI  - Variabilities of the carbon storage of mangroves in Gili Meno Lake, North Lombok District, Indonesia
AB  - Mangrove is one of the coastal vegetation that can act as carbon mitigation (carbon sink and carbon storage). This study aims to determine the potential for carbon sinks and storage in the leaves and roots of each type of mangrove found in Gili Meno lake, North Lombok, Indonesia. The research includes the identification of species and sampling (leaves and roots) of mangroves in the research quadrant. The organic carbon content of mangrove leaves and roots was tested using the Wakley and Black method. The results showed that there were 5 (five) types of mangroves in Gili Meno lake, namely: Avicennia marina, Lumnitzera racemosa, Bruguiera cylindrica, Rhizophora apiculata, and Excoecaria agallocha. The highest leaf tissue carbon content value was R. apiculata at 45.85%C or equivalent to 3.19 g.C, while in roots, A. marina was 50.06%C, equivalent to 4.49 g.C. In addition, the potential carbon stock in the leaves of the entire mangrove ecosystem in an area of 3 ha is 762.81 tons.CÂ±199.257 and at the roots is 659.76 tons.CÂ±394.848, while the largest potential carbon stock in leaf organs is the type of mangrove R. apiculata, which is 318.91 tons.C.ha-1. and at the root is the type of mangrove A. marina, amounting to 448.54 tons.C.ha-1. The estimated carbon dioxide uptake by the Gili Meno mangrove leaves is in the range of 130.36 g.CO2-168.27 g.CO2 or with an average of 154.34 g.CO2Â±14.376, while the species with the highest carbon dioxide absorption capacity is R. apiculata (268.27 g.CO2) and the lowest in the species of L. racemosa (130.36 g.CO2).

TI  - The role of CO2-EOR for the development of a CCTS infrastructure in the North Sea Region. A techno-economic model and applications
AB  - Scenarios of future energy systems attribute an important role to Carbon Capture, Transport, and Storage (CCTS) in achieving emission reductions. Using captured CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) can improve the economics of the technology. This paper examines the potential for CO2-EOR in the North Sea region. UK oil fields are found to account for 47% of the estimated total additional recovery potential of 3739Mbbl (1234MtCO2 of storage potential). Danish and Norwegian fields add 28% and 25%, respectively. Based on a comprehensive dataset, the paper develops a unique techno-economic market equilibrium model of CO2 supply from emission sources and CO2 demand from CO2-EOR to assess implications for a future CCTS infrastructure. The demand for "fresh" CO2 for CO2-EOR operation is represented by an exponential storage cost function. In all scenarios of varying CO2 and crude oil price paths the assumed CO2-EOR potential is fully exploited. CO2-EOR does add value to CCTS operations but the potential is very limited and does not automatically induce long term CCTS activity. If CO2 prices stay low, little further use of CCTS can be expected after 2035. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Nutrient subsidies delivered by seabirds to mangrove islands
AB  - In nutrient-poor landscapes, external nutrient subsidies are important for sustaining local production. Seabirds can transport marine nutrients in the form of guano to terrestrial and coastal ecosystems where they can relieve nutrient limitation. We assessed whether seabirds provide nutrient subsidies to mangrove islands that are strongly limited by phosphorus (P) in the Yucatan Peninsula. Our hypotheses were: (1) seabirds transport nutrients to mangrove islands, (2) mangroves use marine-derived nutrients and (3) nutrient inputs are higher during the nesting season. We chose 6 mangrove islands within a coastal lagoon: 2 with no birds, 2 with temporary birds and 2 with permanent bird colonies. On each, we measured forest structure and soil characteristics (P, pH, salinity and organic matter) for 3 seasons (dry, wet and trade wind season). We collected leaves (green and senescent) to determine P content and resorption efficiency as a measurement of nutrient limitation. Green leaves were also sampled for delta C-13 and delta N-15 to determine nutrient origin. Results show that islands with permanent bird colonies have the highest soil nutrients, which are used by the mangrove trees and relieve some of their nutrient limitation. Nutrient inputs were homogenously distributed through the sediment column, although a decrease in P and an increase in the N:P ratio in the first 20 cm suggests bacterial consumption. Bird nutrient inputs are seasonal, with highest inputs during the nesting season. This study shows an example in which marine-derived nutrients could be important for production of coastal mangrove islands.

TI  - Neutronic investigation of alternative \& composite burnable poisons for the soluble-boron-free and long life civil marine small modular reactor cores
AB  - Concerns about the effects of global warming provide a strong case to consider how best nuclear power could be applied to marine propulsion. Currently, there are persistent efforts worldwide to combat global warming, and that also includes the commercial freight shipping sector. In an effort to decarbonize the marine sector, there are growing interests in replacing the contemporary, traditional propulsion systems with nuclear propulsion systems. The latter system allows freight ships to have longer intervals before refueling; subsequently, lower fuel costs, and minimal carbon emissions. Nonetheless, nuclear propulsion systems have remained largely confined to military vessels. It is highly desirable that a civil marine core not use soluble boron for reactivity control, but it is then a challenge to achieve an adequate shutdown margin throughout the core life while maintaining reactivity control and acceptable power distributions in the core. High-thickness ZrB2 150 mu m Integral Fuel Burnable Absorber (IFBA) is an excellent burnable poison (BP) candidate for long life soluble-boron-free core. However, in this study, we want to minimize the use of 150 mu m IFBA since B-10 undergoes an (n, alpha) capture reaction, and the resulting helium raises the pressure within the plenum and in the cladding. Therefore, we have considered several alternative and novel burnable BP design strategies to minimize the use of IFBA for reactivity control in this study: (Case 1) a composite BP: gadolinia (Gd2O3) or erbia (Er2O3) with 150 mu m thickness ZrB2 IFBA; (Case 2) Pu-240 or Am-241 mixed homogeneously with the fuel; and (Case 3) another composite BP: Pu-240 or Am-241 with 150 mu m thickness ZrB2 IFBA. The results are compared against those for a high-thickness 150 mu m 25 IFBA pins design from a previous study. The high-thickness 150 mu m 25 IFBA pins design is termed the ``IFBA-only{''} BP design throughout this study. We arrive at a design using 15\% U-235 fuel loaded into 13 x 13 assemblies with Case 3 BPs (IFBA+Pu-240 or IFBA+Am-241) for reactivity control while reducing 20\% IFBA use. This design exhibits lower assembly reactivity swing and minimal burnup penalty due to the self-shielding effect. Case 3 provides similar to 10\% more initial (beginning-of-life) reactivity suppression with similar to 70\% less reactivity swing compared to the IFBA-only design for UO2 fuel while achieving almost the same core lifetime. Finally, optimized Case 3 assemblies were loaded in 3D nodal diffusion and reactor model code. The results obtained from the 3D reactor model confirmed that the designed core with the proposed Case 3 BPs can achieve the target lifetime of 15 years while contributing to similar to 10\% higher BOL reactivity suppression, similar to 70\% lower reactivity swings, similar to 30\% lower radial form factor and similar to 28\% lower total peaking factor compared to the IFBA-only core.

TI  - Use of magnetorheological fluids for pressure drop generation
AB  - The magnetorheological fluids (MRF), or magnetic field responsive fluids, are a combination of magnetically polarizable particles in a carrier fluid. This type of fluid has the ability to modify their rheological properties under the influence of a magnetic field. The generation of a tunable pressure drop could have the potential to controlling fluid losses while drilling and cementing in narrow operating windows and to provide a tunable fluid barrier that could work as a packer. Using the reduced form of the Navier-Stokes equation and a model to estimate the yield stress of the fluid based on the magnetic field strength, it is possible to determine the pressure drop caused by the fluid behavior.

TI  - Using flue gas to mitigate ocean acidification
AB  - Researchers from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's (LLNL) Carbon Management Program and the University of California, Santa Cruz found that seawater and calcium could effectively remove most of the CO2 from a natural gas power plant's flue gas stream. A large fraction of the captured gas could then be converted into dissolved calcium bicarbonate - which, pumped into the sea, could be beneficial to the ocean's marine life. The results mean that above-ground CO2 hydration and mineral carbonate scrubbing may provide a "relatively simple" point-source CO2 capture and storage system at coastal locations. According to Greg Rau, a senior scientist with the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz who also works at LLNL, such low-tech CO2 mitigation could be especially relevant for retrofitting to existing power plants and for deployment in the developing world, the primary source of future CO2 emissions.

TI  - Preferential treatment & exemption policy impacts energy
AB  - The preferential treatment and exemption policy of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for State and State Agencies creates an anticompetitive and restraint of trade attitude in California against the development of alternative energy resources by the private sector when such development competes directly with state owned power generation under the State Water & Central Valley Water Projects, particularly in the area of water and power supply. The existing state water policy fails to address the effects of 'global warming' and the adverse potential of the 'greenhouse effect' in California, i.e. rising tides can seriously impact sea water intrusion problems of the San Francisco Bay-Delta Area by not only flooding agricultural lands in the Delta and Central Valley, but impacting the supply of water to large population areas in Southern and Northern California, especially when coupled with drought conditions. The California investigative research results herein reported demonstrates the fallacy of a preferential treatment and exemption policy in a 'free market economy', especially when such policy creates the potential for excessive state budget burdens upon the public in the face of questionable subsidies to special interests, i.e. allowing the resulting windfall profits to be passed onto major utilities and commingled at the expense of public interest so as to undermine the financial means for development of alternative energy resources. The cited Congressional and State Legislative Laws which provide the ways and means to resolve any energy or water resource problems are only as good as the enforcement and the commitment by the executive branch of government and the lawmakers to up-hold existing laws. The need for accountability within the government is as important as the technological achievements in resolving energy resource problems.

TI  - Pendulation control for dynamical positioning capable ship; considerations on actuator usage
AB  - Ship-mounted cranes are used in the offshore industry for, among others, placement of wind turbine components. The pendulation of the load can be decreased with (active) tugger lines. This allows for larger operational weather conditions. In this work we investigate the effect on the actuator usage when the pendulation controller and the ship's dynamic positioning (dp) system are combined. This is done by comparing three situations: i) tightly tuned dp system with independent pendulation control, ii) dp system tuned based on the pendulation controller, and iii) integration of both controllers. The controllers are all designed with the H2 control methodology. Which disturbances should be countered, and which are ignored is explicitly specified, and allows us to indicate that the dp system should not act on the high frequency wave forces, while the pendulation controller should. For a fair comparison, the design penalties are modified such that the load variance is equal in all cases. A frequency domain comparison and a set of detailed time domain simulation shows that extra system information can be used to minimise the actuator usage. The majority of the savings is attained by tuning the pendulation controller and the dp system such that the dp system has as low as possible bandwidth, while still countering low-frequency second order wave effects and saturation of the swing controller. Furthermore, for the pendulation controller's actuator usage, the integration of the controllers helps to minimise its high frequency contents. Â© 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Geological sequestration of CO2 in mature hydrocarbon fields. Basin and reservoir numerical modelling of the Forties field, North Sea
AB  - Numerical modelling is likely the only available tool to evaluate and predict the fate of CO2 injected in deep geological reservoirs, and particularly in depleted hydrocarbon fields. Here we present a methodology which aims at evaluating the geological leaking risk of an underground storage using a depleted oil field as the host reservoir. The methodology combines basin and reservoir scale simulations to determine the efficiency of the storage. The approach was designed for the study of the reservoir after the injection of CO2 and then does not take into account any CO2 injection period. The approach was applied to the Forties field (North Sea) for which CO2 behaviour was simulated for a 1000 y time period. Our findings suggest that local geological conditions are quite favourable for CO2 sequestration. Possible residence time of CO2 will be in the order of thousands of years and, thus such geological depleted hydrocarbon fields storage is probably a good alternative for a long term CO2 sequestration. Additionally, results of this work can help to establish criteria to identify other mature hydrocarbon fields aimed for CO2 sequestration. Copyright Â© 2005, Institut franÃ§ais du pÃ©trole.

TI  - Safety aspects of the use of LNG for marine propulsion
AB  - Liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a fuel shows a large energy to volume ratio. In addition, its combustion is characterized by low levels of production of CO2, SOX, NOX and particulate matter in comparison to conventional fuels. To reduce the emission of SOX into the atmosphere the sulphur content of heavy fuel oils used for marine propulsion will be restricted in the near future. However, LNG is a combustible cryogenic liquid and as such presents specific safety hazards. The large scale use of LNG in the marine sector requires appropriate transport, storage and transfer facilities. The risks connected with the operation of these facilities are analyzed. Specific safety characteristics of the equipment involved are incorporated in the analysis. Safety distances are determined based upon a study of the effects of accidents during which LNG is released. It is found that the pressure at which LNG is released during an accident greatly influences the effect distances. At pressures near atmospheric, the hazards of LNG are comparable to those of conventional liquid fuels such as gasoline. At higher pressures, it behaves more like a combustible gas liquefied by compression. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Unique technical and operational collaboration to complete one of world's hottest offshore hydraulic propped fracturing well
AB  - The main basin at East coast of India, Krishna-Godavari (KG) Basin, is spread across more than 70,000 sq km. on land, shallow and deep water and holds India's highest gas reserve. Deen Dayan East (DDE) field is part of KG Basin in which lay deep HPHT tight gas reservoir that with current drilling and completion technologies can be made viable. An offshore appraisal well was directionally drilled down in S-shaped to the depth of 18700 ft MD to appraise the hydrocarbon potential of Lower Cretaceous Early Rift Fill sequences which was encountered in one of the offset wells in the same field DDE Block. Due to typical extremely tight nature of sandstone reservoir on deep gas well, hydraulic fracturing is the primary method and become inseparable technique to complete this well. Given its HPHT nature, with BHT up to 415F and in-situ stress up to 16000 psi, also the complexity of hydraulic fracturing on limited space of Jack-up rig, the hydraulic propped fracturing project become extremely challenging, both technically and operationally. In addition the limited flexibility on logistic due to short drilling time constraint, made some available fracturing HPHT technology not an option for this project, and require creative domestic solution. There were 2 independent reservoir layer were hydraulically fractured till the end of the well project, and significant gas were tested on post fracture completion from none prior to fracture. This paper illustrates the meticulous planning and preparation to design and execute the hydraulic propped fracturing for well testing appraisal purpose, as collaboration works from operator, fracturing services provider and other third party involved. The core objective of this paper is to capture all lesson learnt during this project delivery, review project operational and technical aspects, and summarize the recommendation and applicable techniques for the similar offshore HPHT hydraulic fracturing project in the future.

TI  - Effects of fiber rope - Seabed contact on subsequent rope integrity
AB  - A 15-month research project was initiated in September 2012, funded by the Research Partnership to Secure Energy for America (RPSEA) and industry partners, with the goal of investigating the effects of polyester mooring rope segments contacting the seafloor prior to installation as part of a deep-water mooring system. It is possible for some soil particles to bypass the particle filter, become embedded in the rope core, and intensify normal fretting wear damage as the installed ropes respond to the cyclic loads resulting from extreme weather forces (such as hurricanes). Potential soil ingress into rope due to accidental contact with the seabed may affect the long-term integrity of the mooring system and increase the risk for failure. This situation, in turn, places nearby subsea and surface infrastructure at risk. This investigation may also provide the ability to qualify particular rope designs for pre-installation on the seabed prior to hook-up. This option would greatly reduce overall risk by reducing the time required to attach mooring lines to a floating facility, thereby reducing time to reach a safely moored condition before arrival of severe weather. This paper is a 2014 continuation of the 2013 OTC paper on the same subject, OTC 24027, and describes: (1) results from extraction of subropes from seabed-soiled full rope 15-meter inserts, (2) laboratory experiments on water and soil particle ingression and migration, and (3) the initial full-scale subrope cyclic wear testing to determine the impact of seabed soil contact on the long-term performance of a mooring system. In summary, all of the experimentation and testing performed to date are showing that with multiple layers of filtering material and with the one alternative filtering system we evaluated, the tentative conclusion is that the rope designs tested can completely protect the mooring ropes from soil ingression, and thus there is no reason to avoid having such ropes drop to the seafloor or be laid on the Gulf of Mexico seafloor. This tentative result assists in working toward the important project goal of reaching agreement between industry participants and U.S. regulatory agencies to qualify polyester mooring ropes for incidental seabed contact and seabed pre-installation.

TI  - Shoreline management plan for a medium energy coast along west coast of India
AB  - Studies on coastal hydrodynamics and sediment transport help to unravel the coastal processes and facilitate formulation of shoreline management plans. An integrated approach which includes, extensive field data collection and numerical modelling is lacking along most of the coasts around the world, particularly along Indian coasts. The coastal stretch from Beypore to Puthiyappa, southwest coast of India has been selected for this present investigation. Harbour breakwaters in the northern and southern boundary of the study region have major impacts on shoreline modifications along this sector. In addition, a small harbour and associated breakwaters are located in the middle of the study region. Seawalls, and combination of seawall and smaller groins are constructed at many places as part of coastal protection. Sediment transport along the coast was computed with LITDRIFT model and the results show net northerly drift of 1.5 {*} 10(5) m(3)/year. The model results are comparable with the quantity of beach sediment mined from Puthiyappa beach (approximately of 0.8 {*} 10(5) m(3)/year). In addition, illegal mining is carried out in the region. Further, the model computed the shoreline evolution along the sector and major accumulation occurs south of Puthiyappa breakwater. Sand deposition close to groins and breakwaters along the study region support the model results. No further intervention along this sector is required for shore protection except, the maintenance of the existing protective measures such as seawalls and groins.

TI  - Influence of sea state in evaluating the accelerations at critical points of a semisubmersible
AB  - In current offshore operations it has been noticed the importance to evaluate the accelerations submitted by a semisubmersible especially during towing operation. The effect of these accelerations on the integrity of a platform structure is extremely important and it should be taken into account by means of a motion analysis. Aiming at obtaining an evaluation of the influence of the sea state in the accelerations at critical points of a semisubmersible, a case study is presented considering different values of significant wave height (Hs) and of mean zero up-crossing period (Tz) in the definition of each sea state for an analysis of the behavior of a semisubmersible unit in waves. Additionally, considering that one of the most challenging steps in a towing operation analysis is to determine which sea state that will occur during the operation, a study has been done in order to verify which sea states that comprises with the criteria of maximum accelerations of that specific floating unit. Throughout this study an abacus of allowable wave height can be developed in function of the wave period, mainly when the criteria of maximum accelerations are known. From these criteria, for different drafts and unit headings, it is possible to obtain the maximum significant wave heights so that the accelerations will not be higher than the established criteria. According to the sea state during the towing operation the abacus could be used to ensure the structure integrity. Also, it could be used previously based on forecast sea state of the scheduled days. Being aware of the influence of the sea state for a platform structure makes the abacus a useful and significant tool in order to analyze a towing operation since it represents the most critical sea state. Indeed, through the abacus technique it is possible to establish the best route in accordance with the wave characteristics of each sea state. Copyright 2013, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Effects of Elevated Carbon Dioxide on Marine Ecosystem and Associated Fishes
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations at the ocean surface are in approximate equilibrium with the atmosphere. Consequently, the amount of CO2 dissolved in oceans increases with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Through ocean acidification, increase uptake of CO2 at the ocean surface lowers the ocean pH level. The availability of dissolved carbonate and bicarbonate primarily caused by CO2 uptake from the atmosphere also changes. Periodically or permanently elevated CO2 concentrations can become a general stress factor in aquatic environments. Excess CO2 can affect the surrounding ocean life, i.e., disturbing growth performance, reproduction, changes in skeletal and otolith development, and fish behavior. Studies on the effects of ocean acidification on fish species have recently received attention. This condition can lead to severe problems if atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise. Therefore, management intervention and decisive action on excessive CO2 emission are necessary to overcome this situation. The information discussed in this review can be utilized as reference in understanding the effects of ocean acidification on marine ecosystem and associated fishes.

TI  - Centralized power generation with carbon capture on decommissioned offshore petroleum platforms
AB  - An offshore central power station installed on the deck of a decommissioned and adapted floating, production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit is projected for supplying the electricity required along the lifetime of four identical FPSOs, aiming to increase the efficiency and alleviate the environmental burden of offshore oil and gas activities. In face of the conflicting targets (e.g. weight, area, cost and efficiency), intrinsic to offshore power generation systems, along with prolonged offdesign operating conditions, a combined thermodynamic, environmental and economic analysis is used to optimize the performance of the power hub proposed. Thus, this work quantifies the space and weight allowance and sheds light on the feasibility of offshore central power stations with carbon capture units, installed on decommissioned FPSOs. As a result, these advanced setups may provide higher overall power generation efficiencies (42%) than existing simple cycle gas turbine (SCGT) configurations (about 30%), even at tenfold lower CO2emissions. Lastly, the peak of energy demand to the power hub, the initial investment and the modular flexibility of the hub are briefly discussed on light of the delay on entrance in operation of each production platform.

TI  - Experimental investigation of the movement of an offshore floating platform in straight wind, tornadic wind, and downburst conditions
AB  - There is growing interest in multi-purpose offshore floating platforms that: harvest energy from the sun, wind, water, and waves; desalinize water; host agriculture and aquaculture; and house residents. While there are some basic commonalities with well established, oil and gas platforms, lighter variants are functionally different with little wind research coverage. Here, we investigate a floating, multi-purpose, light duty platform under 1:150 scaled straight atmospheric boundary layer wind (ABL), tornado like vortices (TLV), and downburst (DB) conditions. The experiments examined the movement of a 1:150 geometrically scaled platform with six degrees of freedom and two mooring Configurations. Four Configurations are studied, (1) Loosely moored platform, (2) Tightly moored platform, (3) Platform with ballast, and (4) Platform with ballast and weight on the deck. DB winds produced the greatest movement, followed by the TLV winds. Little movement was seen under the ABL winds. Loosely moored platforms moved more than tightly moored. Â© 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Bioelectricity generation from live marine photosynthetic macroalgae
AB  - The conversion of solar energy into electrical current by photosynthetic organisms has the potential to produce clean energy. Bio-photoelectrochemical cells (BPECs) utilizing unicellular photosynthetic microorganisms have been studied, however similar harvesting of electrons from more evolved intact photosynthetic organisms has not been previously reported. In this study, we describe for the first time BPECs containing intact live marine macroalgae (seaweeds) in natural seawater or saline buffer. The BPECs produce electrical currents of >50 mA/cm(2), from both light-dependent (photosynthesis) and light-independent processes. These values are significantly greater than the current densities that have been reported for single-cell microorganisms. The photocurrent is inhibited by the Photosystem II inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, indicating that the source of light-driven electrons is from photosynthetic water oxidation. The current is mediated to the external anode via NADPH and possibly other reduced molecules. We show that intact macroalgae cultures can be used in large-scale BPECs containing seawater, to produce bias-free photocurrents, paving the way for the future development of low-cost energy solar energy conversion technologies using BPECs.

TI  - Green routing design in short seas
AB  - In recent years, with the development of shipping industry, the mass of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions originating from ships is also increasing rapidly. To reduce the GHG emissions from ships, designing the optimised routes with higher energy use efficiency is becoming more important for ships navigating in short seas. Based on the innovative application of energy efficiency operational index (EEOI), a route optimisation model is established. To solve the model, we divide one single voyage into several voyage segments and consider the variable speed across voyage segments. Then the navigation strategy is used to find out the sailing route of the minimum EEOI value, this sailing route is called as the green route. Finally, numerical experimental results show that the EEOI values of the experimental groups which used the optimised navigation method are 4.67\%-16.95\% lower than that of the control group. The results demonstrate that the green route designed in this paper can effectively improve the energy use efficiency of ships.

TI  - LEAST COST MICROGRID RESOURCE PLANNING for the NATURAL ENERGY LABORATORY of HAWAII AUTHORITY RESEARCH PARK
AB  - The Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority's (NELHA) campus on The Island of Hawai'i supplies resources for a number of renewable energy and aquaculture research projects. There is a growing interest at NELHA to convert the research campus to a 100% renewable, islanded microgrid to improve the resiliency of the campus for critical ocean water pumping loads and to limit the increase in the long-term cost of operations. Currently, the campus has solar array to cover some electricity needs but scaling up this system to fully meet the needs of the entire research campus will require significant changes and careful planning to minimize costs. This study will investigate least-cost solar and energy storage system sizes capable of meeting the needs of the campus. The campus is split into two major load centers that are electrically isolated and have different amounts of available land for solar installations. The value of adding an electrical transmission line if NELHA converts to a self-contained microgrid is explored by estimating the cost of resources for each load center individually and combined. Energy storage using lithium-ion and hydrogen-based technologies is investigated. For the hydrogen-based storage system, a variable efficiency and fixed efficiency representation of the electrolysis and fuel cell systems are used. Results using these two models show the importance of considering the changing performance of hydrogen systems for sizing algorithms. Â© 2020 ASME.

TI  - Geotechnical properties of salt marsh and tidal flat substrates at Tillingham, Essex, UK
AB  - Salt marshes and, to a lesser extent, tidal flats, attenuate incoming hydrodynamic energy, thus reducing flood and erosion risk in the coastal hinterland. However, marshes are declining in aerial extent both globally and regionally (e.g. the Northwest European region). In order to comprehend why a reduction in salt marsh extent due to marsh edge erosion is occurring, we need to understand the resistance of salt marshes to incoming hydrodynamic energy. This resistance depends on marsh biological, geochemical and geotechnical properties. However, there currently exists no systematic study of marsh geotechnical properties and how these may impact both marsh edge and marsh surface erosion processes (e.g. surface removal, cliff undercutting, gravitational slumping). This has led to an oversimplification of marsh evolution models. Here, we present the initial results of a systematic study of salt marsh and tidal flat geotechnical properties (shear strength, plasticity and particle size) at Tillingham marsh, Essex, UK.

TI  - Drilling to well integrity- multidisciplinary approach using advanced multipole sonic-while-drilling technology saves rig time
AB  - In recent years, as the cost of drilling, evaluating, and completing wells continues to rise in offshore, operators are seeking new technologies that offer measurements comparable to proven wireline logging technologies. Logging while drilling (LWD) technology has progressed swiftly in recent time to address the need for saving rig time by enabling real-time informed decisions for drilling efficiency and risk management. LWD sonic is traditionally used to log formation slowness in the open hole but increasingly being used in cased hole to optimize logging time and evaluate top of cement. Before starting a hole section, well integrity is a critical input to decide if it is safe to drill ahead or additional measures are required to assure operation safety. In this case study we demonstrate that both, measuring formation slowness in open and cased hole along with evaluating the success of a cementing operation can be obtained with the latest generation of LWD sonic tools while drilling, thus saving rig time, simplifying operations, and assuring operation safety and integrity. In this case study we demonstrate that formation slowness can also be recorded in cased hole with LWD tools when the cement bonding is sufficient to allow good coupling. This advanced technique of logging formation slowness through casing with LWD can complement conventional logging, or even save an additional logging run in some cases, and therefore result in significant savings to the operator. Where azimuthal cement evaluation is not a strict requirement, knowing the top-of-cement (TOC) from LWD can help to confirm well integrity without adding rig-time. This in turn will help to take on-time decision to plan additional logging requirements for advanced analysis. Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Algal Photosynthesis, Biosorption, Biotechnology, and Biofuels
AB  - The issues relating to the global warming, air pollution, and energy security have been one of the most important public policy issues nowadays and with the increasing global population, food security has also become a major public policy issue. The development of algal biofuels as a third-generation biofuel has been considered as a major solution for these global problems. Although there have been many reviews on the use of the marine algae in energy, medicine, and health care and there been a number of scientometric studies on the algal biofuels, there has not been any study on the citation classics in the algal photosynthesis, biosorption, biotechnology, and biofuels as in other research fields. As North's New Institutional Theory suggests, it is important to have up-to-date information about the current public policy issues to develop a set of viable solutions to satisfy the needs of all the key stakeholders. Therefore, a selected set of citation classics in the algal photosynthesis, biosorption, biotechnology, and biofuels are presented in this chapter to inform the key stakeholders about the use of marine algae for the solution of these problems in the long run complementing a number of recent scientometric studies on the biofuels and global energy research.

TI  - Alternative power options to reduce carbon footprint of ro-ro passenger fleet: A case study of Croatia
AB  - Emissions produced by fuel oil combustion in marine engines contribute to marine environment pollution and have a negative impact on both human health and the environment. This impact is more pronounced for ships which mostly operate near ports and inhabited areas, such as ro-ro passenger ships. The relevant legislation prescribes a reduction of carbon dioxide on account of its contribution to the problem of global warming. This paper deals with the assessment of the carbon footprint of the Croatian ro-ro passenger fleet in the Adriatic Sea and the corresponding measures to reduce it. This paper analyses a total of 27 ferry lines along the Croatian coast that produce around 29,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually. The analysis distinguishes two lines, Valbiska-Lopar and Vis-Split, with a significantly higher relative contribution to total emissions. The potential to introduce measures to reduce the carbon footprint on these lines is discussed. By implementing these measures, the carbon footprint of the Valbiska-Lopar line can be reduced by almost 40\%, while that of the Vis-Split line can be lowered by around 27\%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Optimal analysis of a hybrid renewable power system for a remote island
AB  - Considering the current challenges posed by energy structural transformation on remote islands, the technical and economic assessment of a hybrid renewable power system were performed considering the Huraa Island of Maldives as a case study. This work models and discusses possible hybrid power system configuration modes based on varying combinations of diesel power, solar photovoltaic (PV) power, wind power, and battery storage. For each mode, the effects of the installed capacity on renewable penetration (RP) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) were analyzed. Furthermore, the configuration modes were compared, and optimal operation schemes were developed by considering RP, LCOE, and CO2 emissions. The results suggest that the use of a high-rated PV power is optimal owing to its high RP and low LCOE. However, when wind power is available, a wind power rating of 1000 kW is an optimal solution, followed by a 500-kW rating; when battery storage is used, a battery capacity of 4000 kWh is ideal. Moreover, it is unnecessary to combine battery storage with these power schemes when an RP <53\% is acceptable. The recommended maximum available RP is approximately 96\% when using an 1800 kW PV, 1000 kW wind, and 4000 kWh battery storage system. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The significance of nitrification for oceanic new production
AB  - The flux of organic material sinking to depth is a major control on the inventory of carbon in the ocean. To first order, the oceanic system is at equilibrium such that what goes down must come up. Because the export flux is difficult to measure directly, it is routinely estimated indirectly by quantifying the amount of phytoplankton growth, or primary production, fuelled by the upward flux of nitrate. To do so it is necessary to take into account other sources of biologically available nitrogen. However, the generation of nitrate by nitrification in surface waters has only recently received attention. Here we perform the first synthesis of open-ocean measurements of the specific rate of surface nitrification and use these to configure a global biogeochemical model to quantify the global role of nitrification. We show that for much of the world ocean a substantial fraction of the nitrate taken up is generated through recent nitrification near the surface. At the global scale, nitrification accounts for about half of the nitrate consumed by growing phytoplankton. A consequence is that many previous attempts to quantify marine carbon export, particularly those based on inappropriate use of the f-ratio (a measure of the efficiency of the 'biological pump'), are significant overestimates.

TI  - Present and Future Changes in Seawater Chemistry due to Ocean Acidification
AB  - The oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 changes the seawater chemistry and potentially can alter biological systems in the upper oceans. Estimates of future atmospheric and oceanic CO2 concentrations, based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emission scenarios, indicate that atmospheric CO2 levels could approach 800 ppm by the end of the century. Corresponding models for the oceans indicate that surface water pH would decrease by approximately 0.4 pH units, and the carbonate ion concentration would decrease by as much as 48\% by the end of the century. The surface ocean pH would be lower than it has been for more than 20 million years. Such changes would significantly lower the ocean's buffering capacity, which would reduce its ability to accept more CO2 from the atmosphere. Recent field and laboratory studies reveal that the carbonate chemistry of seawater has a profound impact on the calcification rates of individual species and communities in both planktonic and benthic habitats. The calcification rates of nearly all calcifying organisms studied to date decrease in response to decreased carbonate ion concentration. In general, when pCO(2) was increased to twice preindustrial levels, a decrease in the calcification rate ranging from about -5\% to -60\% was observed. Unless calcifying organisms can adapt to projected changes in seawater chemistry, there will likely be profound changes in the structure of pelagic and benthic marine ecosystems.

TI  - Recent advances in seaweed seedling production: a review of eucheumatoids and other valuable seaweeds
AB  - Modern seaweed farming relies heavily on seedlings from natural beds or vegetative cuttings from previous harvests. However, this farming method has some disadvantages, such as physiological variation in the seed stock and decreased genetic variability, which reduces the growth rate, carrageenan yield, and gel strength of the seaweeds. A new method of seedling production that is sustainable, scalable, and produces a large number of high-quality plantlets is needed to support the seaweed farming industry. Recent use of tissue culture and micropropagation techniques in eucheumatoid seaweed production has yielded promising results in increasing seed supply and growing uniform seedlings in large numbers in a shorter time. Several seaweed species have been successfully cultured and regenerated into new plantlets in laboratories using direct regeneration, callus culture, and protoplast culture. The use of biostimulants and plant growth regulators in culture media increases the seedling quality even further. Seedlings produced by micropropagation grew faster and had better biochemical properties than conventionally cultivated seedlings. Before being transferred to a land-based grow-out system or ocean nets for farming, tissue-cultured seedlings were recommended to undergo an acclimatization process to increase their survival rate. Regular monitoring is needed to prevent disease and pest infestations and grazing by herbivorous fish and turtles during the farming process. The current review discusses recent techniques for producing eucheumatoid and other valuable seaweed farming materials, emphasizing the efficiency of micropropagation and the transition from laboratory culture to cultivation in land-based or open-sea grow-out systems to elucidate optimal conditions for sustainable seaweed production.

TI  - Innovative technology for ultradeepwater gravity-based separators
AB  - The Troll subsea separation station is now in operation and is establishing a working track record. The Troll subsea separation station separates water and oil and re-injects the water into a dedicated disposal well. The system is installed on the Troll Field, located in the Norwegian North Sea (360 m water depth). The Troll field would experience liquid handling capacity problems if not for the subsea processing station which relieves this problem. The Troll subsea separation station is the only full size, subsea separation station actually installed and operating. The adaptation of this technology to ultra deepwater fields is a major challenge, calling for application of new radically improved methods for gravity based separation. The oil and gas industry is known for its risk awareness, thus the process of adapting subsea separation to ultradeep water fields must be undertaken with care. However, in order to meet the demands of the future deepwater fields, some radical changes will be necessary. This paper will focus on how subsea separation can be adapted to Ultra deepwater fields, and which principles can be used in the next generation of ultra deepwater subsea systems, â€œNuDeepâ€ /1/.

TI  - Adsorbent-assisted supercritical CO2 extraction of carotenoids from Neochloris oleoabundans paste
AB  - Neochloris oleoabundans emerges as alternative source of bioactives that complies with the algae-based biorefinery concept, which consists of a platform that offers a multitude of algae bioproducts. The development of an integrated extractive processes in line with the green chemistry principles have motivated the use of Supercritical CO2 (scCO(2)), as an alternative to toxic organic solvents, for the extraction of bioactives. However, process integration and optimization is challenging because microalgae are grown in liquid cultures, therefore is often necessary a drying step prior to scCO(2) extraction. Moreover, this step is usually energy intensive and risks damaging the compound's bioactivity. An alternative is the simultaneous extraction process of the microalgae paste (containing around 70-80\% water), nevertheless little information is available that explores this type of extraction. This work aims to explore the direct extraction of microalgae paste and to evaluate the effect of water on carotenoid extractions of N. oleoabundans. To study the extraction under a batch-wise system, an indirect extraction system was developed by mixing the microalgae paste with low cost adsorbents as support medium. Two types of silica gels, two different chitosans and active carbon were tested as adsorbents; sea sand was used as inert control. All of the materials showed different adsorbent capacity, being chitosan adsorbents those with higher capacity. However, oleoresin yield and recovery was negligible in a system with only scCO(2) as a solvent and ethanol as co-solvent was required to improve the extraction yield. Although the overall oleoresin recoveries were low for all adsorbents (ranging from 2 to 10\%), chitosan-assisted extraction showed the highest carotenoid recoveries (60-140\% g/g) surpassing acetone benchmark extraction in case of chitosan microspheres. These results are interesting for the development of low energy consumption processes, since there is no need to dry the microalgal paste. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effects of Eddy-Driven Subduction on Ocean Biological Carbon Pump
AB  - Estimates of the ocean biological carbon pump are limited by uncertainties in the magnitude of the physical injection of particulate and dissolved organic carbon to the ocean interior. A major challenge is to evaluate the contribution of these physical pumps at small spatial and temporal scales (<100 km and <1 month). Here, we use a submesoscale permitting biophysical model covering a large domain representative of a subpolar and a subtropical gyre to quantify the impact of small-scale physical carbon pumps.The model successfully simulates intense eddy-driven subduction hot spots with a magnitude comparable to what has been observed in nature (1,000-6,000 mg C.m(-2).day(-1)). These eddy-driven subduction events are able to transfer carbon below the mixed-layer, down to 500- to 1,000-m depth. However, they contribute <5\% to the annual flux at the scale of the basin, due to strong compensation between upward and downward fluxes. The model also simulates hot spots of export associated with small-scale heterogeneity of the mixed layer, which intermittently export large amounts of suspended particulate and dissolved organic carbon. The mixed-layer pump contributes similar to 20\% to the annual flux. High-resolution measurements of export flux are needed to test models such as this one and to improve our mechanistic understanding of the biological pump and how it will respond to climate change.

TI  - Shore-to-ship power supply system for a cruise ship
AB  - The power demand for a large cruise ship during berthing is close to 10 MVA. Such a power demand from the shore-to-ship requires multiple parallel feeds at medium voltage to match with the ship's connection point voltage. The cruise ship authority required installation of a neutral grounding disconnect switch (DS) and insulated ground conductor (IG) at the shore power transformer neutral grounding resistor (NGR) such that during cold ironing the DS will be opened to complete the shore-side, line-to-ground fault current path through the equipment grounding conductor to reach the ship hull first before it returns to the transformer neutral via IG and NGR. Such an installation of the DS appears to violate National Electrical Code (NEC) [1] requirements of a power system grounding. For clarification of this issue, this paper provide example of a ground fault at the shore and a ground fault at the ship using DS and IG in the system.

TI  - Considerations in Harmful Algal Bloom Research and Monitoring: Perspectives From a Consensus-Building Workshop and Technology Testing
AB  - Recurrent blooms of harmful algae and cyanobacteria (HABs) plague many coastal and inland waters throughout the United States and have significant socioeconomic impacts to the adjacent communities. Notable HAB events in recent years continue to underscore the many remaining gaps in knowledge and increased needs for technological advances leading to early detection. This review summarizes the main research and management priorities that can be addressed through ocean observation-based approaches and technological solutions for harmful algal blooms, provides an update to the state of the technology to detect HAB events based on recent activities of the Alliance for Coastal Technologies (ACT), offers considerations for ensuring data quality, and highlights both ongoing challenges and opportunities for solutions in integrating HAB-focused technologies in research and management. Specifically, technological advances are discussed for remote sensing (both multispectral satellite and hyperspectral); deployable in situ detection of HAB species on fixed or mobile platforms (based on bulk or taxa-specific biomass, images, or molecular approaches); and field-based and/or rapid quantitative detection of HAB toxins (via molecular and analytical chemistry methods). Suggestions for addressing challenges to continued development and adoption of new technologies are summarized, based on a consensus-building workshop hosted by ACT, including dealing with the uncertainties in investment for HAB research, monitoring, and management. Challenges associated with choosing appropriate technologies for a given ecosystem and/or management concern are also addressed, and examples of programs that are leveraging and combining complementary approaches are highlighted.

TI  - Compressibility Behavior of MICP-Treated Sand Treated under Unsaturated Conditions
AB  - Microbially induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) is a bio-cementation process using microbes to hydrolyze urea and form carbonate-based minerals with the presence of Ca ion. This reaction produces bonding among soil grains and improves stiffness and strength of soils. The MICP implementation in offshore construction would gain a significant benefit from use of sea water owing to its abundance. However, the effect of various chemical constituents in sea water, such as Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, and Mg2+, on the MICP process remains poorly understood. This study investigates the effect of artificial salt water on the MICP process through batch tests, soil column tests, and microscopic analyses. The batch tests revealed that the level of urea hydrolysis with the salt water was higher than that with the deionized water. We also confirmed that the MICP-Treated sand with salt water showed the greater improvements in small-strain shear modulus and unconfined compressive strength than the one treated with deionized water. Microscopic imaging showed that use of salt water results in different morphology of precipitated minerals though most precipitates still consisted of CaCO3. The experimental results provide clear evidence that various cations in salt water facilitates MICP treatment of soils, and the MICP can be effectively implemented using salt water.

TI  - Innovative Hybrid Energy System for stable Power and eat Supply in offshore oil \& gas Installation (HES-OFF): System Design and Grid Stability
AB  - This paper presents an innovative hybrid energy system for stable power and heat supply in offshore oil \& gas installations (HES-OFF). The hybrid concept integrates offshore wind power with gas turbines and a H-2 energy storage solution based on proton exchange membrane fuel cells and electrolysers. The objectives are: 1) improve the environmental performance of offshore installations by maximizing the exploitation of offshore wind and partially decarbonizing the gas turbines by co-feeding H-2; 2) minimize the negative effects that wind power variability has on the electrical grid frequency stability. This study presents a first assessment of the HES-OFF concept performance using an offshore platform in the North Sea as case study. The results show that the HES-OFF concept: 1) cuts CO2 emissions up to 40 \% when compared to the reference case but requires large H-2 storage capacity to fully exploit wind power throughout the year; 2) allows higher wind power penetration without infringing on the grid frequency requirements.

TI  - Performance analysis of a biomass gasifier genset at varying operating conditions
AB  - An All Power Labs PP20 gasifier generation set (Berkeley, Calif.) was tested to evaluate its suitability for powering biomass conversion technologies (BCT) at remote forest operations sites. Feedstock of the species tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus), coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were tested at moisture contents of 15% and 25% (wet basis). The PP20 was connected to a load bank with five different load profiles designed to simulate possible BCT loads. Two parameters of power quality, voltage variability, and frequency deviation, were determined to be within acceptable limits. The unit also successfully powered a remote biochar operation in Branscomb, California. Emissions of the PP20, when compared to diesel generator regulations, would meet non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) and NOX requirements but exceed the CO emissions limits by a factor of ten. The CO emissions could be reduced by adding a catalytic converter. The results indicate that it is possible to use a PP20 unit to provide electric power for the highly variable loads of a BCT system.

TI  - Planning zero-emissions ports through the nearly zero energy port concept
AB  - This research work attempts to review and compare the available scientific literature, to identify several crucial research opportunities, and to achieve the challenge of putting the findings together to achieve the prospect of nearly Zero Energy Ports. High energy demand and vital supply activities are characterizing ports; they are central hubs in the transport of materials, passengers, vehicles, and cargo. The growing progress of implementing the typical renewable energy installations in port areas and the need for innovative smart energy systems attract port management authorities' attention to energy matters. The research team constructed a specific methodology to review the available literature and viable solutions. All the reviewed measures were analysed and evaluated, highlighting their pros and cons for future implementation alongside their economic or technological maturity according to their cost-effectiveness and the expertise in each one of them. The research gaps per reviewed sector were identified, and suggestions were made in a future agenda for both port decision-makers and researchers. Although ports seem to be similar amongst themselves, due to their upmost goal to transport passengers and goods, they are different and have distinct features. The research team attempted to establish a typology and categorize ports into three (3) main categories according to their specific characteristics. A ``strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats{''} alongside an ``importance-performance{'' analysis were conducted on the proposed concept. This work investigates the literature gaps; the number of studies in many research fields is deficient, and future researchers' opportunities are underlined. Even though the vast majority of the energy management strategies and technologies, along with the green energy generation technologies, are under-exploited in port areas, they have high figurative value and are highly recommended.

TI  - USE OF THE MOVING FRAME METHOD IN DYNAMICS TO MODEL GYROSCOPIC CONTROL OF SMALL CRAFTS AT SEA: THEORY - PART 1
AB  - This paper presents new method in dynamics-the Moving Frame Method (MFM)-and uses it to address a challenge faceing Norwegian shipping. Large offshore renewable energy investments require the use of maintenance boats to keep them in operable conditions. Unfortunately, due to rough seas in some project locations, the transferring of crew members from vessel to turbine or platform is fraught with safety concerns. These concerns can be alleviated by controlling the motion of the transfer vessel. This research studies an add-on stability system for marine vessels to ease the process of offshore platform maintenance and crew member safety. Specifically, this research concerns an internal active system-an active gyroscopic stabilizer-and a more powerful method of theoretical and computational mechanics. This paper derives the equations of motion of a model system equipped with dual gyroscopic stabilizers, using the MFM. The equations of motion are numerically solved to obtain a numerical simulation. The method exploits a variational principle with a restricted variation of the angular velocity. The MFM simplifies dynamics, enables a consistent notation, from 2D to 3D analysis and exploits matrix algebra in lieu of the vector cross product. Finally, in a companion paper to this one, the mathematical model and the numerical simulation is verified with experiments conducted in a large-scale wave tank.

TI  - Numerical modeling of hydrate formation in sand sediment simulating sub-seabed CO2 storage in the form of gas hydrate
AB  - Among several methods for CO2 capture and storage, we focus on CO2 sequestration in the form of gas hydrate under the seafloor, mainly for many sequestration sites offshore Japan and for little risk of CO2 leakage from the sediment. However, it is difficult to evaluate the precise storage potential and cost of this method due to the lack of the relevant information. Here, in order to do feasibility studies of this technique so as to make an effective storage method, we made a 3-dimentional gas water flow simulator with kinetic hydrate formation. The new design of CO2 hydrate formation in porous media under two-phase flow condition was implemented in this simulator, and unknown parameters in necessary mathematical models for gas-water flow in sand sediments were verified from the comparison between the results of the numerical simulations and the experimental measurements from the previous study.

TI  - Design and fabrication of a portable and hybrid solar-powered membrane distillation system
AB  - This paper addresses the development of portable and hybrid solar-powered membrane distillation (SPMD) system for producing freshwater in remote arid and/or coastal areas like in Saudi Arabia. It is a stand-alone system that only uses renewable solar energy to operate. Thus, the system is highly suitable to be implemented in remote arid and coastal areas without infrastructures or connection to the grid (water and power), but blessed with abundant solar irradiation. Because the system is portable, it can also be used for emergency case like a natural disaster (e.g. tsunami). The system uses Vacuum Multi-Effect Membrane Distillation unit from Memsys to desalinate the seawater or brackish water. The SPMD system is a hybrid system that combines thermal collectors and photovoltaic (PV) panel. The thermal collectors convert solar irradiation into thermal energy to drive the Memsys process, whereas PV panel converts solar irradiation into electrical to power electrical equipment. The overall operations of the system were governed by Programmable Logic Controller. The innovation of this system is the design of a hybrid solar desalination system that is portable and reliable. The system can also be considered as a â€œgreenâ€ and sustainable desalination technology. To study the performance of the system, small-scale tests have been conducted at the Engineering College â€“ King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. The system ran successfully by only utilizing solar energy. The total volume distillate output during the test was approximately 70 L with an approximate conductivity of 4.7 Î¼S/cm. The average distillate output rate was 11.53 L/h with the maximum of 15.94 L/h at noon time, whereas the distillate flux was in the range of 1.5â€“2.6 L/m2 h. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Strategy and structure of the API 2 series standards, 2010 and beyond
AB  - API Subcommittee 2 stewards the API Series 2 Recommended Practices and Specification for offshore structures. The Series 2 documents are in the process of realignment. Coupled with several new documents, considerable expansion of key existing RP sections and the impact of recent hurricanes, a considerable change in look, feel and content is underway. The two primary foci for SC 2 consist of providing standards for US waters and leading the US input into the ISO 19900 series of offshore standards. The paper will outline the various components and drivers for the ongoing Subcommittee 2 strategies. These include alignment with the ISO 19900 series (to minimize time and expense of maintaining multiple standards), adjusting to US regulatory changes, incorporating into industry practices the lessons learned from recent hurricanes, while reflecting the effects of the shifts in infrastructure capabilities and industry resources. The history of offshore standards has often been affected by external events. Tropical storms, earthquakes and political unions among others have shaped, and continue to shape, the offshore standards the industry uses today and is developing for the future. As a result of a global strategy developed in the mid-1990's, the API standards are undergoing a comprehensive realignment to better support the broad spectrum of offshore activities and operations in which the industry is engaged today, and is expected to pursue in the future.

TI  - Continued evolution of the one-trip-expansion, single-diameter wellbore
AB  - With more than 300 commercial installations in place, solid-expandable-tubular technology has proved to be a viable and economically feasible alternative to conventional drilling technology. The need for lower lifting costs and to maximize recovery has provided the impetus for the latest step change toward the one-trip section, single-diameter wellbore. In addition to the unique equipment needed to expedite this game-changing technology, new implementations essential to realize the tool components and contingencies had to be developed and tested. The full-length paper explains the overall design and testing approach necessary for the construction of a single-diameter well. Copyright 2005 Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Repeated exposure to simulated marine heatwaves enhances the thermal tolerance in pearl oysters
AB  - In an era of unprecedented climate change, marine heatwaves (MHWs) are projected to increase in frequency, intensity, and duration, severely affecting marine organisms and fisheries and causing profound ecological and socioeconomic impacts. However, very little is known about effects of MHWs on ecologically and economically important bivalve species. Here, we investigate how pearl oysters, Pinctada maxima (Jameson), respond to MHWs under various simulated scenarios. Acute 3-day exposure to MHWs, mimicked by increasing the ambient seawater temperature from 24Â°C to 28Â°C, 32Â°C, and 36Â°C, respectively, induced significant changes (initially sustained increase and late decrease) in activities of antioxidant enzymes (GSH-Px, SOD, CAT, MDA, and T-AOC) and biomineralizaiton-related enzymes (AKP and ACP). Likewise, energy-metabolizing enzymes (NKA, CMA, and T-ATP) showed remarkable acute responses, with significant increases occurring at the beginning and end of thermal exposure. Following repeated exposure to MHWs, without exception, acute responses of assayed enzymes to MHWs were significantly alleviated, implying that pearl oysters have the ability to implement more efficient and less costly energy-utilizing strategies to compensate for thermal stress induced physiological interferences. These findings indicate that marine bivalves can respond plastically and acclimate rapidly to MHWs and pave the way for predicting the fate of this important taxonomic groups in rapidly changing oceans.

TI  - Impact of a fault on CO2 reservoir integrity under depletion
AB  - With a goal of realising a low-carbon emission society, CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS) has been receiving more attention lately. Injecting CO2 into a reservoir is becoming matured by field case studies in the North Sea. The reservoir and the surrounding caprock always face challenges concerning their long-term integrity. This study simulates formation integrity in the presence of a fault as reservoir boundary. A series of geomechanical simulations including coupling with transient pore pressure flow have been implemented into FLAC3D. The simulations reveal that i. Reservoir depletion can yield the neighbouring fault; ii. In the scenario of reservoir depletion, the fault tends to yield with the hanging-wall reservoir rather than with the footing-wall reservoir; iii. The yielded region of the fault propagates upwards with a depleted hanging-wall reservoir, while mostly downward propagation of the yielded fault happens with depletion of the footing-wall reservoir. iv. Due to reservoir depletion, the fault can end up hydraulically connecting neighbouring reservoirs. Â© 2021 ARMA, American Rock Mechanics Association.
