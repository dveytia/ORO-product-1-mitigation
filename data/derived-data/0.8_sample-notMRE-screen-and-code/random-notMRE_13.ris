TI  - Preliminary design of a 75 m Mega Yacht with diesel - Electric hybrid propulsion powered with hydrogen FCs
AB  - The naval research and industry are facing with the significant challenge of ensuring carbon neutrality for the future of sustainable transportation. This imperative arises from the fundamental role that this sector occupies in global trade and the transportation of people. To achieve this goal, the use of green propulsions and alternative fuels play a central role, guaranteeing a significant reduction of ships global emissions and the respect of rules imposed in the Emission Control Areas (ECAs), therefore the preservation of the sea. If environmental awareness has been a reality for which efforts have been underway for years in land-based transportation, the same cannot be said for the maritime industry. For this reason, and with the aim of introducing innovative and more eco-compatible solutions, the paper presents the methodology used for the preliminary design of a 75-m Mega Yacht and sizing of the hybrid diesel-electric propulsion system equipped with hydrogen powered fuel cells and pressurized storage. As current technology does not support long-range sailing with full hydrogen propulsion, the hybrid propulsion was preferred. The configuration presented offers the flexibility of full electric sailing for short distances (up to 130 nautical miles) or to access protected areas, while also allowing traditional propulsion when hydrogen refuelling infrastructure is unavailable at ports or when faster sailing is required. The power unit consists of four FCs with a total power of 540 kW, two 180 kW electric motors combined with two 1765 kW thermal engines. The hydrogen storage area is composed of 105 cylinders with a total capacity of 21.3 m3 and a pressure of 350 bar, respecting the current regulations and guidelines for the use of hydrogen and pressurized explosive gases onboard. Furthermore, the IMO criteria were met to verify the feasibility of the idea. Â© 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

TI  - A Solution to the Problem of Fresh Water Shortage in Egypt Using Nuclear Desalination
AB  - In this paper the possibility of integrating seawater desalination plants with VVER-1200 type reactors is studied. The study is based on a techno-economic analysis of various options for this combination using DEEP software and to optimize the results of the economic analysis, a new MATLAB code was developed. Currently, Egypt has begun the construction of El-Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant, the first nuclear power plant in Egypt to be built on the Mediterranean coast. It will consist of four power units with VVER-1200 type reactors. Energy (electrical and thermal) produced at a nuclear power plant can be used for large-scale desalination of sea water. The use of desalination plants is highly relevant for Egypt, which suffers from a lack of fresh water and at the same time has extensive coastal areas covered by sea water. Â© 2024 IEEE.

TI  - Navigating Sand Management Challenges in Mature Offshore Fields: A Deep Dive into Technologies, Strategies, and Best Practices in Offshore East Malaysia
AB  - Sand production presents significant challenges in the management of mature offshore fields. Field A has faced persistent sand production issues since 2015, resulting in 16 incidents of loss of primary containment (LOPC) across surface valves and flowlines within a six-year period, leading to substantial production losses. The presence of sand has also caused significant locked-in potentials (LIP) in Field A, resulting from the choking or shut-in of wells due to the risk of sand production, and adversely impacted well performance even after remedial sand control measures were implemented. Consequently, considerable efforts were directed towards enhancing the effectiveness of sand management in Field A. A comprehensive approach encompassing seven lenses of sand management was adopted, integrating subsurface and surface considerations. Digital technologies played a pivotal role in transitioning the team from reactive to proactive sand management practices. Continuous monitoring, improvisation, and enhancement of these seven lenses over the years have been instrumental in safeguarding production in Field A. Emphasis has been placed on the integration of these technologies through effective reservoir, well, and facilities management (RWFM) workflows, involving production engineers, operations engineers, and offshore crew members, thereby enabling holistic sand management. As a result, significant production improvements were observed, and no LOPC events have occurred since 2020 at Field A. The applications of game-changing technologies such as erosion-resistant thru-tubing sand screens (ERTTSS), surface bulk desander systems, acoustic sand monitoring, ultrasonic flowline thickness sensors, and other initiatives also instilled higher confidence in managing sand production issues. In conclusion, this paper offers a comprehensive summary of the key elements within the holistic sand management approach adopted in Field A. Overall, this paper highlights the operational philosophies underpinning real-time monitoring systems, predictive maintenance, and proactive intervention approaches implemented in Field A, that serves as a valuable resource for oil and gas operators seeking to optimize sand control practices and enhance overall production efficiency in mature oil and gas field.

TI  - Innovation and Application of Intelligent Injection & Production and Remote Monitoring Technology in Offshore Oilfields
AB  - As the development of major offshore oilfields enter the mid to late stage, the workload of platform operations gradually increases. Conventional injection and production technology has low efficiency in wire testing and adjustment, making it difficult to meet the demand of efficient reservoir development. In view of the above issues, and combining the characteristics of large well deviation, large flow rate and small diameter of oil and water wells in Bohai oilfield, the whole set of data communication device is integrated into the downhole intelligent working cylinder through the design of mechanical structure, flowmeter, circuit composition and seal protection, and real-time communication is established with the ground control system by means of a single-core cable, realizing real-time reading and efficient regulation of downhole stratified data such as temperature, pressure and flow rate in platform control center. On this basis, through the further research and development of land terminal monitoring system, ultimately achieving remote monitoring and control of oil and water wells on offshore platforms, allowing reservoir engineers to have access to first-hand on-site information in the office. The test results show that the technology is not limited by well deviation and the number of injection and production layers, and the efficiency of testing and adjustment is improved by 96% compared to the conventional separate injection and production technology. The maximum flow rate of a single layer can reach 800m3/d, which can meet the requirements of large flow rate and small diameter in Bohai Oilfield. Up to now, the cable-control intelligent injection and production technology has been applied to over 180 wells in Bohai Oilfield, greatly improving the various indicators of fine water injection and oil stability and water control, providing strong technical support for promoting the intelligent and digital process and the construction of intelligent oilfield in Bohai oilfield.

TI  - High Efficiency Coring in Deviated, Interbedded and Unconsolidated Formation. A Case Study from Offshore Southeast Asia and Potential Technology Enabler for CCUS Wells
AB  - Core jamming is the primary factor that negatively impacts the efficiency of coring operations, especially in deviated wells in sandstone reservoirs which are highly interbedded with shale lamination. Additional coring trips are frequently needed to cut the remaining target reservoir which results in additional cost and reduced coring efficiency. An additional challenge is the acquisition and recovery of cores in a soft and young unconsolidated sediment with unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of less than 1000 psi within interbedded reservoir sections using conventional catchers. This paper discusses the techniques and technology required for overcoming these challenges and provides supporting case studies from selected wells. The reservoir geology obtained from these offset wells' core samples was studied and evaluated. Coring operating parameters and lessons learnt from the offset wells were reviewed in connection with the previous coring system deployed. The recovery from previous wells was low, based on the best available technology at that time. This insight led to the utilization of jam mitigation technology, commonly used in consolidated and fractured formation applications, to be integrated with a full closure catcher system typically used in soft formation. Combining both individual systems into a unified single coring system addresses the challenges of both jamming in highly interbedded formations and recovering soft and young unconsolidated sediment. Also, by the nature of the full closure system's IT shoe, there is less interaction with the core catcher which allows for reduction of early onset jamming as well. This technology has been successfully developed and deployed in three wells in offshore Southeast Asia (SEA) based on the challenges of these applications, and the performance of this uniquely integrated coring system proved successful on all three wells in two different fields. The high recovery percentage of 98.6% of 171 cored meters proved that this technology addressed the challenges of coring recovery and efficiency in a sandstone reservoir which is highly interbedded with shale lamination and unconsolidated soft formation. The jam mitigation system activation in three out of the eight runs prevented an extra trip and the full closure catcher contributed to a high recovery rate. This coring technology enhancement is a critical solution which enables improved coring efficiency, reduced coring runs, an increased core recovery percentage, and optimizes coring performance in similar challenging future reservoirs. In addition, the high quality of cores acquired using this technology will also be beneficial for coring and laboratory analysis in both caprock and reservoirs for all potential sustainable storage solutions. Integrating reservoir studies with high quality core-based results will help in project planning by reducing risks and improve the outcomes for both Conventional and Energy Transition domains.

TI  - Microstructure and Hardness Properties of a S690QL Steel Welded Joint
AB  - Offshore structures, including oil and gas platforms, wind turbines, and wave energy converters, are subject to harsh environmental conditions and high-stress cyclic loading. The reliability and safety of these structures are critical, and the performance of welded joints is a key factor in ensuring their structural integrity. Employing precise welding techniques are essential to minimize degradation of the mechanical properties of welded joints, particularly in preventing the formation of brittle phases and ensuring long-term service reliability. To accomplish this, a thorough examination of the hardness properties of two different S690QL steel welded joints was conducted using Vickers hardness testing. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) was used to complement the hardness assessments. Thicker joints show lower hardness values in the heat-affected zone due to slower cooling rates. Conversely, higher hardness values in the upper sections of welds imply the influence of increased heat input during final tempering steps. This research underscores the significance of precise heat treatment techniques in mitigating residual stresses, controlling the characteristics of the heat-affected zone and enhancing mechanical properties, thus contributing to improve structural integrity and safety.

TI  - Holistic Approach for Managing Drilling Limiters Improves Well Duration by 20% - A Case History of Successful Implementation of New Technologies and Operational Practices in Offshore Malaysia
AB  - Drilling wells safely without any harm to the environment, faster, more efficiently, and economically have historically been the primary points of operating companies. While these goals are achieved through technology, drilling optimization, and cost reduction approaches; the operator must still deal with multiple discrete service providers, including drilling contractors, with different success targets that may or may not align with the operator's strategy. The concept of Integrated Rig, Drilling and Completion (iRDC) projects is the driver for delivering wells successfully and economically through collaboration and integration. In one such iRDC project in offshore Malaysia, with single focal point handling various drilling services, the project learning curve was improved with numerous efforts and optimization measures undertaken by means of smart drill and value stream mapping processes. Holistic offset well data analysis was performed using historical time-based data to identify improvement opportunities. These were primarily used to maximize the rate of penetration (ROP) by identifying and mitigating main ROP limiters. A batch drilling concept was deployed for the offshore wells. The drilling sequence considered offline well testing and casing cementing operations while, simultaneously, the rig was skidded to drill other wells on the same platform. Furthermore, well sequence optimization considered reservoir management and well hook-up. Overall risks were considered while performing simultaneous operations (SIMOPs). Dynamic performance benchmarking was the key to success. Initial key performance indicators (KPIs) were defined and validated. As new performance benchmarks were achieved, the team sought to standardize best practices using a work method. This work method then became the new standard for operational preparation. New KPI targets were discussed and challenged by the rig crews to deploy a competitive and winning spirit. These efforts focused on proper identification and mitigation of the major causes of non-productive time (NPT) and invisible lost time (ILT) based on advanced data analytics. This enabled overall improvement of 25% for on-bottom ROP and 30% reduction to flat time, in addition to other improvements to several areas: shoetrack drill-out time was reduced by 30% and a 35% improvement to BHA/casing tripping speed was achieved. The paper discusses the operational challenges and step-by-step chronology of solutions deployed to maximize drilling performance and reduce average well duration by 20% in one year. In addition, it covers a holistic and structured approach for managing drilling limiters, which enhanced drilling connection practices by 40%. This approach effectively eliminated historical backreaming issues for a highly deviated 16 in. hole section without increasing the well stability risk profile and drilling 16 in. hole 15% faster than planned.

AB  - With the development of hydrogen production technology from offshore wind power and natural gas, the deep-sea energy interconnection system using hydrogen energy as the medium is constantly improving. Liquid hydrogen storage and transportation is an effective method for large-scale transportation and utilization of offshore hydrogen energy. Revealing the mechanism of falling film flow under offshore sloshing conditions is the key to realize efficient storage and transportation of floating hydrogen energy. In this paper, the method of floating visualization experiment and numerical simulation is conducted to reveal the offshore adaptability enhancement mechanism of falling film flow outside the FLH2 (floating hydrogen liquefaction unit) channel tube during floating hydrogen energy storage and transportation, based on high-speed camera technology and sloshing platform, the coupled VOF and Level Set two-phase flow model and moving grid technology. The results show that the liquid film uniformity of the falling film flow outside the corrugated tube is better than the conventional circular tube, spiral grooved tube and square corrugated tube. Under the offshore conditions, the flow pattern of corrugated tube is stable, and the dry patch of corrugated tube surface does not appear. It is recommended to use the corrugated tube in the floating hydrogen liquefaction unit. Based on visual experiments and numerical simulation results, the evolution law of falling film flow pattern and a calculation correlation for film thickness of corrugated tube are obtained.

TI  - The role of hydrogen storage and pipelines in highly sector coupled European energy systems
AB  - The transition towards net-zero energy systems requires large-scale integration of wind and solar generation. Energy storage, transmission and sector coupling are important flexibility solutions to manage the inherent variability in weather dependent generation. Due to the uncertainty in projecting the role of hydrogen in the energy systems towards 2050, there is uncertainty in the role of hydrogen assets in providing the flexibility. The literature does not fully agree on how competitive the solutions are expected to be compared to flexibility from the power system side and other sectors. There is also uncertainty in whether placing hydrogen infrastructure onshore or offshore makes the most sense, which is a topical question as interest in offshore energy hubs grows. This paper studies pathways towards 2050 to understand the role of hydrogen storage and pipelines in different scenarios, focusing on the Central and Northern Europe. The results indicate that while hydrogen pipelines have a role in highly sector coupled scenarios, electric transmission lines are seen important in all scenarios. The optimality of onshore vs. offshore placement of hydrogen infrastructure varies between different studies. Â© Energynautics GmbH.

TI  - Real-Time Ocean Prediction via a Grid of Autonomous Self-powered Swarm of Ocean Sensors
AB  - Ships are estimated to spend annually an extra $25B worth of fuel because of encountering ocean waves en route. In terms of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, this extra fuel translates to more than 10% of total emissions by the worldâ€™s transportation sector. Part of the reason that waves take this much energy to combat is that the details of incoming waves are usually not known a priori. Therefore, the effort at the bridge (pilothouse) is mainly focused on the shipâ€™s stability as it advances in waves, rather than optimizing fuel consumption in an unpredictable seaway. Our idea is to use a swarm of autonomous self-powered smart ocean sensors (hardware), combined with data-driven-based prediction algorithms already developed (software) in order to be able to predict ocean waves. Each unit of our ocean sensors can actively and autonomously position itself at a designated location for a given time period in order to measure wavesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ height, frequency, and direction which are required for our prediction and smart routing/steering algorithm. This idea, when implemented, paves the path for a smart and efficient automatic steering in a seaway, that we estimated can easily save 15% of the cost of current method of advancing in waves. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of state of the art technologies, challenges, current state of this project, and the future outlook.

TI  - Machine learning facilitated the modeling of plastics hydrothermal pretreatment toward constructing an on-ship marine litter-to-methanol plant
AB  - An onboard facility shows promise in efficiently converting floating plastics into valuable products, such as methanol, negating the need for regional transport and land-based treatment. Gasification presents an effective means of processing plastics, requiring their transformation into gasification-compatible feedstock, such as hydrochar. This study explores hydrochar composition modeling, utilizing advanced algorithms and rigorous analyses to unravel the intricacies of elemental composition ratios, identify influential factors, and optimize hydrochar production processes. The investigation begins with decision tree modeling, which successfully captures relationships but encounters overfitting challenges. Nevertheless, the decision tree vote analysis, particularly for the H/C ratio, yielding an impressive R2 of 0.9376. Moreover, the research delves into the economic feasibility of the marine plastics-to-methanol process. Varying payback periods, driven by fluctuating methanol prices observed over a decade (ranging from 3.3 to 7 yr for hydrochar production plants), are revealed. Onboard factories emerge as resilient solutions, capitalizing on marine natural gas resources while striving for near-net-zero emissions. This comprehensive study advances our understanding of hydrochar composition and offers insights into the economic potential of environmentally sustainable marine plastics-to-methanol processes.

TI  - International shipping in a world below 2 Â°C
AB  - The decarbonization of shipping has become an important policy goal. While integrated assessment models (IAMs) are often used to explore climate mitigation strategies, they typically provide little information on international shipping, which accounts for emissions of around 0.7 GtCO2 yr-1. Here we perform a multi-IAM analysis of international shipping and show the potential for decreasing annual emissions in the next decades, with reductions of up to 86\% by 2050. This is primarily achieved through the deployment of low-carbon fuels. Models that represent several potential low-carbon alternatives tend to show a deeper decarbonization of international shipping, with drop-in biofuels, renewable alcohols and green ammonia standing out as the main substitutes for conventional maritime fuels. While our results align with the 2018 emission reduction goal of the International Maritime Organization, their compatibility with the agency's revised target is still subject to a more definitive interpretation. International maritime shipping accounts for an important proportion of global CO2 emissions, but its role in a world with deep decarbonization has not been thoroughly examined. Through a multi-model comparison, this study reveals the necessity of reducing and stabilizing emissions from this sector in the next few decades.

TI  - Blue Carbon Assessment in the Salt Marshes of the Venice Lagoon: Dimensions, Variability and Influence of Storm-Surge Regulation
AB  - Salt marshes are intertidal coastal ecosystems shaped by complex feedbacks between hydrodynamic, morphological, and biological processes. These crucial yet endangered environments provide a diverse range of ecosystem services but are globally subjected to high anthropogenic pressures, while being severely exposed to climate change impacts. The importance of salt marshes as ``blue carbon{''} sinks, deriving from their primary production coupled with rapid surface accretion, has been increasingly recognized within the framework of climate mitigation strategies. However, large uncertainties remain in salt marsh carbon stock and sequestration estimation. In order to provide further knowledge in salt marsh carbon assessment and investigate marsh carbon pool response to management actions, we analyzed organic matter content in salt marsh soils of the Venice Lagoon (Italy) from 60 sediment cores to the depth of 1 m and estimated organic carbon stock and accumulation rates in different areas. Organic carbon stocks and accumulation rates were highly variable in different marshes, being affected by organic and inorganic inputs and preservation conditions. Our estimates suggest that the studied marshes store 17,108 +/- 5,757 tons of carbon per square kilometer in top 1-m of soil and can accumulate 85 +/- 25 tons of carbon per square kilometer per year. However, flood regulation may reduce the annual marsh CO2 sequestration potential by more than 30\%. Our results contribute valuable information for regional carbon assessments, reinforcing the need for integrated coastal management policies to preserve the ecosystem services of coastal environments, and underscore the importance of considering local variability and methodological variations.

TI  - Unveiling the Potential of Cryogenic Post-Combustion Carbon Capture: From Fundamentals to Innovative Processes
AB  - Climate change necessitates urgent actions to mitigate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel-based energy generation. Among various strategies, the deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) solutions is critical for reducing emissions from point sources such as power plants and heavy industries. In this context, cryogenic carbon capture (CCC) via desublimation has emerged as a promising technology. While CCC offers high separation efficiency, minimal downstream compression work, and integration potential with existing industrial processes, challenges such as low operating temperatures and equipment costs persist. Ongoing research aims to address these hurdles in order to optimize the desublimation processes for widespread implementation. This review consolidates diverse works from the literature, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of CCC technology, including the latest pilot plant scale demonstrations. The transformative potential of CCC is first assessed on a theoretical basis, such as thermodynamic aspects and mass transfer phenomena. Then, recent advancements in the proposed process configurations are critically assessed and compared through key performance indicators. Furthermore, future research directions for this technology are clearly highlighted.

TI  - Oyster farming helps reducing China's greenhouse gas emissions for food production
AB  - Bivalve farming represents an economically and ecologically beneficial approach to addressing the escalating global food demand. Notably, oysters, which constitute a substantial proportion of cultivated bivalves, exceeding 40 \%, demonstrate considerable potential for expansion. Assessing the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of oyster aquaculture is critical for establishing emission benchmarks and advancing sustainable food systems, yet remains understudied. This study quantifies cradle-to-gate GHG emissions for Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) farming in China, spanning algae culture, hatchery rearing, and sea farming. Results reveal remarkably low emissions of 92.97 kg CO2-eq per metric ton of fresh oyster. Sea farming (38.75 \%) and hatchery operations (37.99 \%) dominate emissions, while algae cultivation contributes minimally (1.43 \%). Oyster protein production generates just 3.30 \% of beef's GHG emissions per kilogram. In 2022, China's oyster farming provided over 0.15 million metric tons of protein, offsetting an estimated 15.33 million metric tons of CO2-eq compared to beef. Incorporating renewable energy, optimizing aquaculture practices, improving larval survival rates, and using sustainable materials could reduce emissions by 10-30 \%. These findings underscore oyster aquaculture as a lowemission protein source with significant scalability, offering a viable pathway to mitigate food-sector climate impacts while meeting rising global protein demand.

TI  - Estimating the economic impacts of cargo handling equipment electrification: A case study of the San Pedro Bay ports
AB  - Large seaport complexes contribute significantly to air toxic and GHG emissions. As human health impacts of air toxics and climate change grow, policy efforts to reduce these emissions are increasing. California, particularly the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach (POLA/POLB), has taken the lead in air toxic and GHG mitigation policies. The ports aim to achieve zero emissions cargo handling equipment (CHE) by 2030. We use a macroeconometric model, REMI PI+, to analyze the impacts of electrifying CHE at POLA/POLB on the California economy and the transportation sector for 2020-2045. We estimate a net present value loss of about \$7.4 billion (2019 dollars) in gross state product (GSP), with potential losses ranging from \$5.3 to \$10.0 billion GSP depending on assumptions about equipment replacement requirements, electricity price, and capital funding sources.

TI  - Exploring seaweed as a sustainable solution for carbon dioxide adsorption: Trends, opportunities, and future research prospects
AB  - Numerous industrial activities burn fossil fuels, releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and worsening climate change. To mitigate this, industries are integrating adsorption technology, using activated carbon as an adsorbent to reduce CO2 emissions. Recently, seaweed has emerged as a promising precursor for activated carbon, similar to coconut shells. However, a gap exists in the literature, as no comprehensive study has systematically reviewed seaweed- derived activated carbon for CO2 adsorption applications. Hence, this study addresses this gap by integrating a systematic review and bibliometric analysis, offering a novel methodological approach for a holistic understanding of the topic. The study formulates research questions, develops a systematic search strategy, and employs bibliometric analysis, science mapping, and qualitative content analysis of data from the Scopus database to interpret, analyze, and discuss the findings. It highlights a rising publication trend from 2013 to 2023, with China as the leading contributor, and underscores that research on this topic is mainly published in high-quality journals. Science mapping reveals key research themes and identifies existing gaps, while qualitative analysis provides directions for future studies. The study also emphasizes the significant potential of seaweed-derived activated carbon in applications such as wastewater treatment, air filtration, energy storage, and green fuel production, while its exploration in CO2 adsorption remains limited. Therefore, the potential for further research is outlined in the future research recommendations. Ultimately, this study offers valuable insights for various stakeholders and supports Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 13.

TI  - Exploring the Feasibility of Green Hydrogen Production Using Wind Energy in India
AB  - India heavily relies on coal for about 70 \% of its energy demand, leading to a concerning 29 \% increase in CO2 emissions from 2015 to 2022. The need for alternate fuels is evident with rising energy demand and the rapid depletion of fossil fuels. Green hydrogen emerges as a solution, leveraging renewable energy sources to mitigate environmental impact. This study assesses five high-speed wind locations in India for green hydrogen production, analysing wind resource potential using six different wind turbine (WT) models. A comprehensive techno-economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of hydrogen production, considering factors like annual energy production (AEP), hydrogen production, levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). Furthermore, the study quantified the carbon emissions mitigated using wind energy for hydrogen production instead of conventional methods. Additionally, the study assessed the hydrogen storage capacity. Results indicated Mandvi (S2) as the most potential location, boasting a capacity factor of 50.51 \% and AEP by WT4 of 13.273 GWh, yielding 221.21 tons of hydrogen annually. Cost analysis reveals an LCOE of 0.0225 \$/kWh and an LCOH of 2.3103 \$/kg. Furthermore, utilizing WT4 at the S2 location could mitigate 12.37 Mt/year of carbon emissions.

TI  - KPI-Based Evaluation Framework for Cyber Resilience of Ships
AB  - Advancements in information and communication technologies have improved operational efficiency in the maritime industry through the integration of operational technology and information technology systems. However, this integration increases external network interfaces, exposing ships to greater cyber threats. Operating in isolated environments far from ports, ships face challenges in responding to cyberattacks and securing timely technical support. As a result, cyber resilience has become a critical concept in the maritime domain. To address these challenges, organizations like the International Maritime Organization and classification societies have issued guidelines. The International Association of Classification Societies introduced Unified Requirements E26, specifying minimum technical requirements to enhance ship cyber resilience. However, Unified Requirements E26 falls short of adequately reflecting the operational environment of ships and does not sufficiently address managerial and operational factors, limiting its effectiveness in evaluating ship cyber resilience. This paper proposes a KPI-based framework to evaluate ship cyber resilience. Seven evaluation domains-Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover, and Adapt-were identified to encompass technical, managerial, and operational aspects. Using the SMART methodology, 18 measurable Key Performance Indicators were developed to enable comprehensive resilience evaluation. The proposed framework addresses existing guidelines' limitations and provides a systematic tool for assessing and improving maritime cyber resilience. This contribution enhances the safety and security of the maritime industry by aligning resilience evaluation with ship-specific operational characteristics.

TI  - MAPSO-based mode transition process optimisation of ship parallel hybrid power system
AB  - Hybrid power ships are the focus of attention in the shipping industry due to their low carbon and high efficiency benefits. However, fluctuations in stern shaft speed and equipment wear generated by its power system during mode transition has been an inadequately addressed problem. To this end, this paper first takes a 7500-ton bulk carrier as the research object and builds a hybrid power system model in the AMESim simulation platform for simulation and verification work. Then, the stern shaft speed overshoot rate, stern shaft rotational speed jerk, and clutch slip friction work are used as indicators, which are normalised and weighted as a multi-objective evaluation function for mode transition. With the objective of minimising the value of this function, the modified adaptive particle swarm algorithm (MAPSO) is used to solve the control problem of shaft motor torque and clutch oil pressure during mode transition and the optimisation results are obtained. The results show that the simulation accuracy of the established model can reach 1.1\%., and the MAPSO-based mode transition coordinated control strategy reduces the stern shaft speed overshoot rate, stern shaft rotational speed jerk, and clutch slip friction work by 86.32\%, 52.01\% and 24.91\% during EP mode to PTI mode respectively and 86.73\%, 58.80\% and 35.05\% during EP mode to PTO mode respectively, compared with prototype control strategy.

TI  - Assessing carbon stock change for effective Nature-based Solutions implementation allocation: A framework
AB  - Mapping and assessing the carbon stock change (CSC) in urban areas can support the allocation of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) to mitigate climate change and advance urban sustainability. However, an effective framework concerning historical CSC and future simulation to support the allocation of NbS implementation is lacking. To fill this gap, we proposed a framework and applied it in the Zhejiang coastal region based on the assessment of historical (from 1990 to 2020) and predicted future (2030) CSC and local context analysis of urban and ecosystem challenges. Over the past three decades, the Zhejiang coastal region has experienced a considerable C stock loss of 20.34 Tg, predominantly owing to fast urbanization. The severest C stock reduction occurred from 2000 to 2010, with a slowdown in the following decade. Even so, more effective spatial management policies are urgent to mitigate further C stock depletion. Our framework identified 50.51% of the study area as the allocation area for NbS implementations where current and future C sequestration demand existed. Within the allocation area, six NbS types identified from literature were allocated or co-allocated, leading to eight tailored NbS implementations to tackle specific urban and ecosystem challenges of each location. The most widely allocated NbS implementations were â€œNbS1 Ã— NbS2 Ã— NbS3â€ and "NbS2 Ã— NbS4", covering 42.86% and 34.69% of the allocation area. NbS2 covered nearly the entire allocation area (98.80%), with its primary role of habitat preservation and to control urban expansion. The proposed framework can be adapted to support various planning decisions regarding the prioritization and spatial allocation of NbS. Â© 2024 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Environmental tradeoff on integrated carbon capture and in-situ methanation technology
AB  - Compared to conventional CO2 removal methods, carbon capture and in-situ conversion using dual function materials avoid compression and transportation of CO2, which is regarded as a promising technology. Although it brings additional economic benefits, the environmental impacts of CO2 capture and conversion remain unclear. A life cycle assessment of an integrated CO2 capture and methanation system using dual function materials is conducted to investigate its feasibility to reduce global warming. Life cycle inventory is obtained through construction, operation, and disposal process of the integrated system. A dynamic model of CO2 capture and methanation is developed to obtain the operating parameters. Results show that the optimal global warming potential is 0.706 kg CO2,eq per kilogram captured CO2, which indicates the advantages of using dual function materials for carbon mitigation. Global warming potential is a minor factor among the overall normalized environmental impacts, only accounting for 0.5 \% of the total normalized impact, while the main factor marine aquatic ecotoxicity accounts for around 73 \%, and fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity accounts for around 23 \%. Global warming potential is the most affected by green hydrogen input, followed by dual function material input. Results reveal that the integrated CO2 capture and conversion using dual function materials is conducive to carbon mitigation but has significant other environmental impacts, such as marine aquatic ecotoxicity, and the main contributors to the environmental impacts are wind electricity, green hydrogen, refrigerator, and dual function material.

TI  - Evaluation of carbon dioxide storage potential in wells of the Bredasdorp Basin offshore South Africa
AB  - This study focuses on determining how carbon dioxide (CO2) storage can be stored in the central Bredasdorp basin offshore South Africa. Logs, seismic lines, and reports of three exploration wells were used to build a 3D static model, and the compressibility method was used to estimate the CO2 static storage capacity of the reservoir. The wells displayed fair to good porosity and moderate permeability. The zone of interest had little to no faulting, and there is evidence of differential deposition of marine sandstones that overlie fluvial shales. The sandstones have good reservoir characteristics and are overlain by thick shales that serve as seals. The reservoir displayed thinning in the eastern direction and over structural highs. A static storage assessment of the reservoir showed 0.64 Mt of CO2, and the effect of changing pore volume and water saturation on overall CO2 storage volume was observed. The results revealed that an increase in pore volume would also increase the amount of CO2 stored in the reservoir. Conversely, increased water saturation leads to decreased CO2 that can be stored in the reservoir. This study has shown that the pre-existing reservoir fluid has an impact on CO2 storage volume; the greater the volume of water in the reservoir, the less the volume of CO2 that can be stored in the reservoir; this is because water is less compressible than rock, oil or gas.

TI  - Experimental study on CO2 hydrate formation in clay-rich sediments for sub-seafloor CO2 sequestration
AB  - Mitigation of climate change has evolved into an increasingly intricate issue. One of the innovative strategies for the long-term sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) is the implementation of hydrate-based CO2 sequestration in marine sediments. Among the various lithologies found in natural marine sediment, clay plays a prominent role in inhibiting the thermodynamics and kinetics of hydrate formation, which possess as a major challenge for this technology. This research investigated the formation of CO2 hydrates in the simulated clay-rich marine sediments, with clay mass fractions varying from 0 to 30 wt\%. The considerable difficulties that arise from the formation of CO2 hydrates in clay-rich sediment were emphasized. To enhance the formation of hydrates, the utilization of L-tryptophan as a promoter was investigated. Additionally, experiments were conducted to determine the effect of clay on hydrate dissociation behaviors, as well as the impact of temperature and pressure on CO2 hydrate formation in the clay-rich sediment. This study offers insights into CO2 sequestration via hydrate formation in clay-rich marine sediments, as well as the potential for the advancement of hydrate-based carbon capture and storage (CCS) strategies.

TI  - Data-Driven Analysis of Regional Ship Carbon Emission Reduction: The Bohai Bay Area Case Study
AB  - With the tightening of marine carbon emission reduction policies, the sustainable development of the shipping industry has attracted much attention, and it is of great significance to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) big data to study the carbon emissions of marine ships. Taking ships around Bohai Bay as the research object, this paper constructs a calculation method of ship carbon emissions driven by the ship AIS trajectory. The AIS information of ships is extracted, and the sailing status is determined. The carbon emission calculation model is built based on the AIS data, the carbon emission in 2023 is empirically measured, and the characteristics are analyzed. At the same time, a speed simulation model was built to evaluate the impact of speed reduction on carbon emissions and put forward emission reduction measures. The results show that the carbon emission of ships around Bohai Bay in 2023 was 8.8072 million tons, with cargo ships contributing the most, and the carbon emissions of the cruise state was significant. A 10\% reduction in speed would reduce annual carbon emissions by about 6\%. This study provides a reference for understanding the impact of speed on carbon emissions and formulating emission reduction measures, which can be used to compare historical and future data to support the emission reduction in ports and shipping enterprises.

TI  - Carbon sequestration potential of Sonneratia apetala plantation forests in the Chakaria Sundarbans: Effects of stand age and structure
AB  - Coastal plantation ecosystems play a crucial role in combating global warming by serving as effective carbon sinks. Sonneratia apetala (Keora) is a fast-growing tree species that significantly influences local carbon sequestration rates, but still there is lack of knowledge about how this carbon sequestration rate changes with stand age and structure. So, we investigated how carbon stock changes across four different aged of S. apetala plantation forests (8, 16, 24, and 32 years) in the Chakaria Sundarbans. Twenty representative plots (20 m x 20 m) were selected from 4 different stand ages (8, 16, 24, and 32 years) using stratified random sampling design (SRSD) method. Soil organic carbon (SOC) content from 0 to 30 cm soil layers, aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) were studied to calculate the total carbon stock (TCS). A positive correlation was observed between TCS and stand age. The TCS at the 8, 16, 24, and 32 years old plantation sites was 60.85, 109.73, 136.29, and 183.48 t ha-1, respectively. The mean annual carbon accumulation rate (CAR) were 7.60, 6.86, 5.68, and 5.73 t ha-1 year-1 in these respective sites, indicated that the CAR significantly decreased with stand age. At the stand ages of 8, 16, and 24 years, soil organic carbon storage (SOCS) significantly outweighed total biomass carbon stock (TBCS), with percentages of 85.02 \%, 60.68 \%, and 55.65 \% of TCS, respectively. However, at 32 years old stand, TBCS (54.77 \%) exceeded SOCS (45.23 \%). The TCS values were equivalent to 223.32, 402.71, 500.18, and 637.37 t ha-1 CO2 at 8, 16, 24, and 32 years old stands, respectively, revealed a significant potential for CO2 sequestration. These findings can be used in the development of effective forest management strategies with restoring mangrove to maximize carbon storage potential in the southeastern coasts of Bangladesh, ultimately helping to reduce CO2 gas emissions to combat adverse effect of climate change.

TI  - Green Hydrogen and Its Supply Chain. A Critical Assessment of the Environmental Impacts
AB  - Green hydrogen produced via electrolysis powered by renewables can greatly contribute to achieving carbon neutrality. The analysis of 35 papers reporting the life cycle assessment (LCA) of green hydrogen supply chains confirms the lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with respect to other hydrogen forms and conventional fossil fuel and carbon systems. However, the global warming potential of green hydrogen worsens if grid electricity is used to back up renewable sources. Green hydrogen is also responsible for water consumption and for land use, while offshore platforms may be responsible for the loss of marine biodiversity. Another potential environmental hotspot is the depletion of rare metals and critical materials employed in the electrolyzer and in the power generation plants. This issue is exacerbated by the lack of information about the management of the end-of-life stage of this equipment. Notably, the delivery along the supply chain is responsible for hydrogen leaks, whose environmental consequences are still uncertain.

TI  - Case study on the combined use of surface seawater injection and depressurization for sustainable natural gas hydrate extraction
AB  - In response to the issue of inefficient extraction of natural gas hydrates due to a lack of heat supplementation during long-term production, a combined extraction method integrating surface seawater injection and depressurization has been proposed. Under the premise that the surface seawater injection pipeline possesses certain thermal insulation properties, this method can sustainably harness solar energy to replenish the thermal energy of gas hydrate reservoirs. Numerical simulations based on a validated three-dimensional heterogeneous model from the 2013 Nankai Trough pilot production in Japan demonstrate that this method significantly enhances hydrate extraction efficiency compared to depressurization alone. The results show that, over a 500-day production scenario, methane recovery efficiency can be enhanced by up to 150\%. The study reveals that only an appropriate injection temperature can effectively improve the efficiency of hydrate exploitation. Compared to the depressurization-only method, this extraction approach increases the temperature driving force (TDF) near the injection well improved by up to 12 K. However, higher injection rates suppress depressurization effects, requiring a balance between injection temperature and rate. The proposed approach also facilitates more uniform reservoir deformation, reducing localized subsidence risks. These findings suggest that the combined surface seawater injection and depressurization method provides an effective and environmentally friendly solution for sustainable hydrate exploitation.

TI  - Autonomous observations enhance our ability to observe the biological carbon pump across diverse carbon export regimes
AB  - The expansion of autonomous observation platforms offers vast opportunities for analyzing ocean ecosystems and their role in carbon export. As part of the EXport Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing campaign, we autonomously measured the productivity regimes in two contrasting end-member ecosystem states. The first campaign occurred in the subpolar North Pacific near Ocean Station Papa (Site 1), characterized by iron limitation and a highly regenerative regime. The second captured a springtime bloom in the North Atlantic (Site 2), which typically drives efficient export of productivity. Using a combination of floats and gliders carrying biogeochemical sensors, we quantified gross primary productivity, net community production, and organic carbon export potential (fC(org)) to assess biological carbon pump strength. Site 2 demonstrated higher cruise-period productivity, with roughly 5x the gross primary productivity and 13x the euphotic zone net community production seen at Site 1. Greater export efficiency at Site 2 was reflected in numerous indices, such as the ratio of new production to net primary productivity (ef-ratio; Site 1: 0.33; Site 2: 0.73), the ratio of sinking particulate organic carbon to net primary productivity (ez-ratio; Site 1: 0.24; Site 2: 0.69), and mean daily fC(org) (Site 1: 3.4 +/- 0.7; Site 2: 20.3 +/- 2.3 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)). Together with particulate organic carbon flux derived from thorium-234 measurements, we infer that observed low net community production was almost entirely routed to sinking particulate organic carbon at Site 1, while the much higher net community production at Site 2 resulted in near-equal proportions routed to dissolved organic carbon production and sinking particulate organic carbon.

TI  - Enhancing CO2 sequestration safety with hydrate caps: A comparative study of CO2 injection modes and saturation effects
AB  - Leakage prevention of CO2 is crucial for the safety of submarine geological carbon sequestration, with hydrate caps identified as effective barriers against leakage. The stability and efficiency of these caps are influenced by water saturation, initial hydrate saturation, and H2O-CO2 seepage behaviors, but mechanisms governing rapid cap formation and efficient sequestration remain unclear. This study investigates hydrate cap formation under H2O-CO2 co-injection and CO2 pre-injection modes, analyzing the effects of water and hydrate saturation on sealing caps stability and CO2 sequestration efficiency. Results show that CO2 pre-injection promotes uniform hydrate distribution in sealing caps, reducing localized accumulation and enhancing sequestration efficiency. Moreover, the cap formation time negatively correlates with hydrate saturation and positively with water saturation in the pre-injection mode, while no linear relationship is observed in the co-injection mode. Optimal water saturation for rapid cap formation in co-injection mode is 40\%-80 \%. Compared to co-injection, CO2 pre- injection reduces cap formation time by 61.43 \%, CO2 leakage by 32.56 \%, and forms a pressure drop buffer region during cap failure, preventing continuous leakage and improving long-term sequestration safety. The present study provides technical support for the marine geological CO2 sequestration using the hydrate cap method.

TI  - Carbon territoriality at the land-water interface
AB  - Large volumes of organic carbon are stored in wetland ecosystems such as mangrove forests, peatlands, salt marshes and seagrass meadows. Efforts to mitigate anthropogenic climate change are transforming the governance of these naturally saturated carbon sinks. Scientific and market valuations of wetlands as carbon have prompted diverse experimentation with carbon sequestration projects and offset programs. These activities may displace wetland-reliant communities and add to societal equalities. This perspective paper develops the concept of carbon territoriality to explore emerging spaces of climate governance in wetlands. It moves beyond terracentric policy debates tied to fixed and flat landscapes by integrating literature on the dynamic (sub)surface and atmospheric territorial dimensions of carbon. It posits that combining scientific knowledge of fixed carbon stocks with the inherited knowledge of coastal and riparian communities about fluid land-water connections could foster more inclusive and equitable forms of climate stewardship within biogeophysically relevant boundaries.

TI  - Techno-economic modeling of carbon dioxide hydrate formation for carbon sequestration
AB  - Significant carbon sequestration capacity (up to 10 Gigatons/yr) will be needed by 2050 to limit the Earth's temperature rise to <1.5 Â°C. Current worldwide sequestration capacity is only âˆ¼40MT/yr, which highlights the need for the development of new and scalable sequestration approaches. One promising approach for long-term sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) is the deposition of CO2 hydrates (ice-like solids of water and CO2) on the seabed with artificial sealing (or under marine sediments). Technologically, this involves formation of CO2 hydrate foam, transport of the foam to the sequestration site, compaction into hydrate plugs, sealing and then disposal. Critical to the techno-economic success of this concept is the ability to rapidly form hydrates. The present group has achieved very high rates of formation of hydrate foam by bubbling CO2 gas at high flow rates in a bubble column reactor (BCR). This study utilizes recent experimental results on ultra-fast hydrate formation to conduct a detailed techno-economic analysis of the hydrate foam-making process. All analysis is conducted for a 1 Megaton/yr sequestration project with project life of 30 years. Our analysis shows that the energy requirements (assumed as electrical in this study) for hydrate formation equal 260 kWhr/ton and the total cost of hydrate foam production is $36/ton. The biggest cost component is energy, which accounts for 51 % of total cost. A 1 Megaton/yr project will require an initial capital investment of $150 M. Such a project will consume 0.66 million cubic meters of seawater/yr. Contributions of various key processes to the total cost are quantified. Process-wise, the biggest contributors to total cost are refrigeration and gas compression, which account for 41 % and 27 % of the total cost, respectively. Cost of the BCR is only 0.1 % of the total investment cost. Also, gas recirculation in the BCR contributes minimally (0.14 %) to the overall energy requirement. Finally, this study identifies pathways to reduce $/ton costs to increase the viability of this carbon sequestration approach. It is noted that hydrate transportation, compaction and sealing are not included in this analysis which focuses on the techno-economics of rapid hydrate formation only. Â© 2024

TI  - Avicennia alba, an Additional Potential Carbon Sequester in Mangrove Ecosystems
AB  - Mangrove forests have exceptional carbon sequestration capacity for mitigating climate change impacts. Increased atmospheric CO2 can accelerate crop growth, improve water-use efficiency, and disrupt soil-plant balance. The performance of Avicennia alba in terms of morphometrics and biomass under environmental stresses such as elevated CO2 was poorly understood. Thus, this study aims to determine the growth response and survivability of A. alba by examining height, leaf number, and growth rate under elevated CO2 in the early stages of development. A number of 120 seed samples of A. alba was divided into two groups; 60 germinated seeds were placed in a CO2 incubator and 60 in a shade house as a control. The growth rate, plant height, leaf number, and mortality were compared between the two groups and statistical analyses were conducted. The treated seedlings exhibited significantly greater mean height (11.98 +/- 1.09 cm), improved growth rates (1.09 +/- 0.76 vs. 1.07 +/- 0.46), and higher survivability (U = 1470, p-value < 0.05). There is a significant positive relationship between height and number of leaves (beta = 0.298, R-2 = 0.535, p-value < 0.001), indicating that taller seedlings tend to produce more leaves. A comprehensive understanding of the balance between enhanced growth and reduced leaf production under elevated CO2 levels provides valuable insights into how plants may adapt or respond to changing environmental conditions in future climate change scenarios.

TI  - Enhancing efficiency in solar non-intrusive desalination: Solar still prototype optimization in Southwest Europe
AB  - Access to freshwater is a pressing global challenge. Despite being irreplaceable freshwater is an increasingly scarce resource, especially in regions as Southern Europe, due to high human pressure and climate change. Solar desalination presents a low impact solution to produce freshwater from seawater, particularly in sun-rich regions. The main goal of this study was to develop a modular solar desalination system based on a non-intrusive approach, with simple assemblage, installation, and maintenance, to produce freshwater for non-potable purposes. The modular design was chosen to allow scalability and adaptability, enabling effective response to variable water demands in small island communities. The case study is a small island from Algarve, Portugal (Southwest Europe). The study evaluates the performance enhancements accomplished by transitioning from an initial prototype solar desalination unit, smaller and with a simple design, to an enhanced pilot-scale system designed to improve efficiency and water output. The research showed that both systems exhibit a high conductivity removal (higher than 99 \%), demonstrating the potential of this technology to produce freshwater from seawater, delivering high-quality desalinated water, across different seasons. Prototype 1 demonstrated limited productivity, around 0.45 L/day.m2, while pilot-scale unit presented a productivity of approximately 6 L/day.m2 in summertime. This substantial improvement reflects the design modifications implemented in the pilot-scale unit, positioning it as a valuable option for water desalination in regions with abundant solar resources. These findings confirm the strong potential of solar desalination as a non-intrusive and effective solution and lays the groundwork for future advancements, focusing on maximising efficiency by exploring innovative materials to enhance solar energy absorption and optimizing operational conditions.

TI  - Marine ecosystem role in setting up preindustrial and future climate
AB  - The ocean ecosystem is a vital component of the global carbon cycle, storing enough carbon to keep atmospheric CO2 considerably lower than it would otherwise be. However, this conception is based on simple models, neglecting the coupled land-ocean feedback. Using an interactive Earth system model, we show that the role ocean biology plays in controlling atmospheric CO2 is more complex than previously thought. Atmospheric CO2 in a new equilibrium state after the biological pump is shut down increases by more than 50\% (163 ppm), lower than expected as approximately half the carbon lost from the ocean is adsorbed by the land. The abiotic ocean is less capable of taking up anthropogenic carbon due to the warmer climate, an absent biological surface pCO2 deficit and a higher Revelle factor. Prioritizing research on and preserving marine ecosystem functioning would be crucial to mitigate climate change and the risks associated with it.

TI  - Higher nitrification and lower consumption drive higher N2O effluxes in estuarine than non-estuarine mangrove wetlands
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are highly productive, sequestering large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere while emitting relatively low levels of greenhouse gases. Large amounts of organic matter and nitrogen from river discharge may stimulate production and emission of greenhouse gases including N2O, thus reducing the blue carbon storage capacity of mangrove wetlands. However, it is unclear how the input of organic matter and nitrogen affect the emission fluxes of these greenhouse gases in mangrove wetlands. In this study, we compared the effluxes of N2O between the estuarine and non-estuarine mangrove wetlands near the seven major rivers on Hainan Island of China. The averaged N2O emission flux in the estuarine mangrove wetlands was 6.9 times than the non-estuarine mangrove wetlands. In the non-estuarine mangrove wetlands N2O emission flux increased significantly with total nitrogen content in the sediments. In contrast, organic carbon (OC)/organic nitrogen (ON) ratios were associated with N2O emissions in the estuarine mangrove wetlands. As rivers bring in more organic matter with high ON content, more N2O emissions occur in estuarine areas. OC in sediments are from different sources between estuary (fresh water dissolved OC (DOC)) and non-estuary (marine DOC) area. A higher OC/ON ratio leads to higher nitrification and lower N2O consumption enzyme activities in estuary areas compared with non-estuaries, which contributes extra N2O fluxes. Our study provides a direct process assessment of the response of natural N2O emissions to sediment chemistry changes caused by river inputs.

TI  - Beyond fuel: the case for a wider perspective on shipping and climate change
AB  - In July 2023, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) set a new climate change strategy for the international shipping sector. Critically, this strategy now includes `checkpoint' and `strive' greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2040, en route to zero emissions by around 2050. Recent analysis highlights that the IMO's `strive' targets are essential staging posts and the minimum level of ambition for the sector to play its part in meeting the Paris Climate goals. However, progress towards meeting the IMO's 2030 and 2040 goals is being stymied by an overly dominant narrative discourse focused on fuels and longer-term (2050) targets: this focus is at odds with the new short-term targets, due to the long lead time for deployment of green fuels at scale, particularly given the slow turn-over of shipping fleets. This article sets out why a change in emphasis towards short-term energy and emission reduction is critical if the sector is to play its part in meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. It sets out why this is a no-regrets option, complementing necessary ongoing work on alternative fuels. Recommendations for realizing this shift in emphasis include aligning the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) with the IMO's new `strive' target, shifting the focus of organizational strategies towards reducing cumulative emissions, and rethinking ship design to optimize for ultra-efficiency, wind-assist propulsion and battery power.

TI  - Evaluation of just in time strategy regarding carbon intensity indicator
AB  - This paper proposes an energy efficiency strategy based on data-driven artificial neural network (ANN) methodology. It is aimed to reduce fuel consumption and ship-sourced emissions emitted into the atmosphere as well as increase the energy efficiency level of the ship. In this regard, a noon report data belonging to a bulk carrier that cruises open seas is obtained. Using average daily distance and speed as input parameters and fuel consumption as an output parameter, various ANN configurations are created to determine fuel consumption based on the arranged optimal ship speed identified by eliminating anchorage periods as possible. After defining the best structure, a new dataset with optimal speeds is constituted. As a result of this procedure, annual fuel consumption is decreased by 397 tons which equals 6.21\% of annual total consumption. Accordingly, significant contributions regarding emission reduction and fuel expenses are revealed. Lastly, the impact of just in time approach on ship energy efficiency management is examined. It is observed that it provides influential advantages in increasing the carbon intensity indicator degree of the ship, especially for the near future. It is determined that additional precautions are required for long-term operations.

TI  - Assessment framework to predict sensitivity of marine calcifiers to ocean alkalinity enhancement - identification of biological thresholds and importance of precautionary principle
AB  - Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE), one of the marine carbon dioxide removal strategies, is gaining recognition in its ability to mitigate climate change and ocean acidification (OA). OAE is based on adding alkalinity to open-ocean and coastal marine systems through a variety of different approaches, which raises carbonate chemistry parameters (such as pH, total alkalinity, aragonite saturation state) and enhances the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. There are large uncertainties in both short- and long-term outcomes related to potential environmental impacts, which would ultimately have an influence on the social license and success of OAE as a climate strategy. This paper represents a synthesis effort, leveraging on the OA studies and published data, observed patterns, and generalizable responses. Our assessment framework was developed to predict the sensitivity of marine calcifiers to OAE by using data originating from OA studies. The synthesis was done using raw experimental OA data based on 68 collected studies, covering 84 unique species and capturing the responses of 11 biological groups (calcifying algae, corals, dinoflagellates, mollusks, gastropods, pteropods, coccolithophores, annelids, crustacean, echinoderms, and foraminifera), using regression analyses to predict biological responses to NaOH or Na2CO3 addition and their respective thresholds. Predicted responses were categorized into six different categories (linear positive and negative, threshold positive and negative, parabolic and neutral) to delineate responses per species. The results show that 34.4 \% of responses are predicted to be positive (N=33), 26.0 \% negative (N=25), and 39.2 \% (N=38) neutral upon alkalinity addition. For the negatively impacted species, biological thresholds, which were based on 50 \% reduction of calcification rate, were in the range of 50 to 500 mu mol kg-1 NaOH addition. Thus, we emphasize the importance of including much lower additions of alkalinity in experimental trials to realistically evaluate in situ biological responses. However, it is important to note our results do not consider equilibration with the atmosphere and are thus only applicable to short-term and near-field application. The primary goal of the research was to provide an assessment of biological rates and thresholds predicted under NaOH / Na2CO3 addition that can serve as a tool for delineating OAE risks. This will help guide and prioritize future OAE biological research and regional monitoring efforts and will also aid in communicating risks to stakeholders. This is important given the fact that at least some of the current OAE approaches do not always assure safe biological space. With 60 \% of responses being non-neutral, a precautionary approach for OAE implementation is warranted, identifying the conditions where potential negative ecological outcomes could happen, which is key for scaling up and avoiding ecological risks.

TI  - Controlling Engine Load Distribution in LNG Ship Propulsion Systems to Optimize Gas Emissions and Fuel Consumption
AB  - The increasing emphasis on environmental sustainability and stricter gas emissions regulations has made the optimization of fuel and emissions a crucial factor for marine propulsion systems. This paper investigates the potential to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions of LNG ship propulsion systems by using different load sharing strategies in Dual-Fuel Diesel-Electric (DFDE) propulsion systems. Using data collected from on-board cyclic measurements and an optimization model, the effects of different load sharing strategies for various types of fuel, such as HFO, MDO, and LNG, under different engine load conditions were investigated. The results of these strategies are compared with those of on-board power management systems (PMS), which evenly allocate power among the engines, irrespective of fuel usage and emission levels. The results show that load adjustments according to the optimization model can considerably increase fuel economy and contribute to the reduction of CO2 and NOx compared to standard practice at the equal load in different ship operating modes. Our approach introduces an innovative optimization concept that has been proven to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions beyond standard practices. This paper demonstrates the robustness of the model in balancing environmental and operational objectives and presents an effective approach for more sustainable and efficient ship operations. The results are in line with global sustainability efforts and provide valuable insights for future innovations in energy optimization and ship emission control.

TI  - Numerical study on a potential of the rotating cylinder in the auxiliary propulsion of ships
AB  - Faced with environmental and economic challenges, the transition to renewable energies is a priority, particularly in the maritime transport sector, which is subject to increasingly strict regulations. For ships, this adaptation remains complex due to space constraints and the rapid pace of technological advances, sometimes making certain solutions quickly obsolete and generating losses for shipowners. This work explores the use of rotating cylinders, based on the Magnus effect, as an auxiliary propulsion solution for ships. This effect occurs when air circulating around a rotating object creates a pressure difference, generating a force perpendicular to the airflow and the cylinder's axis of rotation. Compared to other wind technologies, this method has promising potential to reduce emissions and improve energy efficiency. The results of this study highlight the economic and environmental benefits of rotating cylinders, positioning them as a clean and renewable energy for ship propulsion. These findings, consistent with previous work, highlight the rationale of this technology, already adopted by some modern commercial vessels, such as bulk carriers, oil tankers and cruise ships, which seek to optimize their energy efficiency. Thus, despite the challenges, the benefits related to fuel savings and reduced emissions make Flettner cylinders a promising solution for the future of maritime transport.

TI  - Toward a green strategy of sponge mariculture and bioactive compounds recovery
AB  - Sponges are benthic filter-feeder invertebrates capable to produce a variety of high value bioactive compounds. Nevertheless, exploitation of sponges as bio-factories requires scalable and sustainable strategies to supply sponge biomass without threatening wild natural populations and to minimize the consumption of toxic organic solvents in metabolites extraction and purification procedures. Sponges farming in integrated facilities nearby fish mariculture cages represents a highly efficient strategy combining the production of sponge biomass with bioremediation. Here we report the results of the in situ rearing of the keratose sponge Sarcotragus spinosulus developed within three years in an innovative Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture system in the Gulf of Taranto (Southern Italy, Mediterranean Sea), capable to supply large-scale sponge biomass with a minimal impact on wild populations. Moreover, we demonstrate the proof of concept that it is possible to produce polyprenyl hydroquinones, selected as well-known bioactive model metabolites, in good yields, high purity degree and low organic solvent consumption, by means of an innovative protocol based on the combination of supercritical carbon dioxide fluid extraction and gel permeation chromatography. Such a combination of eco-friendly techniques paves the way to eco-sustainable supply of bioactive compounds from marine organisms highly profitable in terms of working times, costs, solvents, and energy saving.

TI  - Aotearoa New Zealand's marine carbon cycle in a changing climate - Current understanding and future directions
AB  - The marine system plays a critical role in the global climate cycle, as a major control of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Marine primary production (photosynthesis) and remineralisation of organic carbon (respiration, degradation) determine the amount of CO2 sequestered in marine sediments and deep-water environments on century to millennial timescales. The stocks and fluxes of the marine carbon cycle are susceptible to global climate change impacts and other anthropogenic activities that modify key processes. Oceanographic studies of the marine carbon cycle in Aotearoa New Zealand's Exclusive Economic Zone (NZ EEZ) and Territorial Seas over past decades have provided broad knowledge across a complex and dynamic seascape, but there remain fundamental knowledge gaps that limit identification of and response to present and future anthropogenic threats. In particular, several areas of the EEZ have been under-sampled and there are currently insufficient data to establish baselines and variability for the marine carbon cycle. We recommend that new observational technologies and ocean modelling applications be fully developed and utilised to enable development of robust predictive capability of our ocean's response to human-induced perturbations. Future focus on oceanic nature-based solutions to accelerate CO2 uptake will require improved knowledge of the marine carbon cycle in NZ's EEZ.

TI  - Stronger increase of methane emissions from coastal wetlands by non-native Spartina alterniflora than non-native Phragmites australis
AB  - Globally, Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis are among the most pervasive invasive plants in coastal wetland ecosystems. Both species sequester large amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and biogenic carbon in soils but also support production and emission of methane (CH4). In this study, we investigated the magnitude of their net greenhouse gas (GHG) release from invaded and non-invaded habitats. We conducted a meta-analysis of GHG fluxes associated with these two species and related soil carbon content and plant biomass in invaded coastal wetlands. Our results show that both invasive species increase CH4 fluxes compared to uninvaded coastal wetlands, but they do not significantly affect CO2 and N2O fluxes. The magnitude of emissions from Spartina and Phragmites differs among native habitats. GHG fluxes, soil carbon and plant biomass of Spartina-invaded habitats were highest compared to uninvaded mudflats and succulent forb-dominated wetlands, while being lower compared to uninvaded mangroves (except for CH4). This meta-analysis highlights the important role of individual plant traits as drivers of change by invasive species on plant-mediated carbon cycles.

TI  - CO2-Enhanced Gas Recovery (EGR) in Offshore Carbon-Rich Gas Reservoirs-Part 2: EGR Performance and Its Dependency
AB  - CO2-enhanced gas recovery (EGR) has emerged as a promising method for improving hydrocarbon production and achieving carbon sequestration in offshore gas reservoirs. This study investigates the performance and influencing factors of CO2-based gas displacement using long core displacement experiments. Consolidated synthetic cores were prepared to replicate reservoir conditions, and experiments were conducted at formation pressure and temperature to evaluate the effects of permeability, injection pressure, CO2 concentration, and core length on gas recovery efficiency. The results reveal that (1) for a homogeneous porous medium, permeability and injection pressure have minimal correlation with recovery efficiency when sufficient gas is injected; (2) direct gas displacement after reservoir depletion outperforms pressure-boosting displacement methods; (3) higher CO2 concentrations delay gas breakthrough, enhance piston-like displacement behavior, and improve recovery efficiency; and (4) core length significantly affects recovery, with longer cores resulting in slower breakthroughs and more stable displacement. Cores of at least 1 m in length are essential for accurately simulating field conditions. For a CO2 injection with a pressure of 7 MPa and a temperature of 81 degrees C, when 0.87 PV of CO2 is injected, the current recovery can reach 87\%, after which the displacement efficiency decreases sharply. The ultimate EGR can be as high as 50\%. These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing CO2 injection strategies for enhanced gas recovery in offshore reservoirs, offering guidance for both experimental designs and practical applications in the field.

TI  - Currents of change: Social-environmental valuation of electric ships for sustainable passenger transport
AB  - Air and maritime transport services enable mobility and economic and social development, but they have significant environmental impacts. To reduce carbon emissions, there is a growing trend towards adopting electric ships for short-distance passenger transport. Nonetheless, there is a lack of appropriate valuation frameworks. This paper proposes a framework specifically tailored for evaluating investments in electric ships, considering the economic, environmental, and social impacts. A real options approach balancing users' utility is used, with demand following a stochastic process and unexpected jumps. Using the Azores as an empirical case study, the results revealed that investing 25 million euros in electric ships yields a significantly positive impact on social welfare (1906 million euros). For long-distance travel, maritime transport's impact on social welfare is diminished, making it less suitable. Embracing electric ships can unlock new possibilities for enhancing social welfare and sustainability. The contribution of this paper lies in its unique approach, as very few frameworks enable the comprehensive social-environmental valuation of green investments.

TI  - On-Board measurement of emissions on a dual fuel LNG powered cruise ship: A sea trial study
AB  - The use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in dual-fuel engines is expanding in the maritime industry, enabling compliance with sulfur and nitrogen oxide emissions regulations, while also reducing atmospheric emissions of particulate pollutants. LNG further allows for a reduction in direct CO2 emissions compared to liquid fuels such as marine gas oil (MGO), which also helps meet greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction requirements in maritime transport. However, unburned methane emitted by dual-fueled engines remains an area for improvement. In this study, we monitored the atmospheric emissions of unburned methane, along with other gaseous and particulate pollutants, from a 4-stroke dual-fuel engine during sea trials of a new cruise ship, using both LNG and MGO fuels that these engines can operate on. During this ship's commissioning phase, we were able to perform measurements across a wide range of engine loads and confirm higher emission factors for unburned methane at low loads: the emission factor remains relatively stable at around 2.3 g.kWhâˆ’1 between 60% and 95% engine load, but increases at lower loads, reaching 8.5 g.kWhâˆ’1 at 25% load. For fine particulate emissions, characterized by the number of particles larger than 23 nm (PN23), we established that switching from MGO to LNG results in a reduction factor of approximately 136 in PN23 particles emitted by the engine at high load. The measured emission levels in MGO mode were relatively independent of engine load but tended to increase in LNG mode as engine load decreased. Based on our measurements of methane and CO2, we propose a comparison of GHG emission levels as a function of engine load, which shows that switching from LNG to MGO at 75% load results in an 18% relative increase in CO2 equivalent emissions. Finally, we had access to engine load monitoring (ELM) during commercial operation over a 3-month period. The load distribution obtained shows that the diesel-electric architecture, which adjusts the number of engines in operation and their load according to the vessel's energy demands, leads to a limitation in the use of the engine at low load. As a result, less than 7% of the engine operating time is spent at a load below 30%, a threshold beyond which the studied engine emits less than the default FuelEU value of 3.1%. When considering a usage-weighted average, based on the emission factors measured on board and the load distribution derived from the Engine Load Monitoring (ELM), we obtain an emission factor of 3.2 g.kWhâˆ’1, or 1.7% of the fuel use. This value of 1.7% is lower than that specified by the FuelEU regulation, and it appears to be representative of the actual emissions of this vessel and its usage under operational conditions.

TI  - Reducing carbon footprint in ports through electrification and flexible energy management of ships
AB  - The environmental impact of maritime transport has become a central concern for the international community. The Carbon Intensity Indicator and the Emissions Trading System are key mechanisms pushing the shipping sector towards more sustainable and less polluting solutions, including the adoption of alternative technologies to diesel generators and the reduction of heavy fuel oil employment. Port areas are particularly controlled, as the environmental impact of shipping operations affects both the environment and human-inhabited areas. Given that the electrification of ports (cold ironing) is not yet widespread globally, this work proposes an on-board poly-generation system equipped with high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells and batteries to meet energy demands during entry, dock, and exit from port areas. Various operational strategies (rule-based energy system management) for managing on-board technologies are analysed, offering a range of potential applications based on the on-board availability of hydrogen and battery discharge modes, with the aim of reducing the ship's environmental impact in port areas. Additionally, to fully electrify the poly-generation system, this study explores replacing auxiliary oil-fired boilers with heat pumps for steam production, integrating this technology into the low-temperature engine cooling circuit to enhance energy efficiency and eliminate emissions from auxiliary systems. By implementing these technologies alongside the developed operational strategies, it is possible to achieve an 80-90\% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in the port area, improving the carbon intensity indicator by 4.74\%, from 11.06 to 10.38.

TI  - Data-Driven Propulsion Load Optimization: Reducing Fuel Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Double-Ended Ferries
AB  - As the focus on climate action and sustainable development of the shipping industry intensifies, the maritime sector has intensified its focus on decarbonization. Although the ferry sector accounts for a small part of the global fleet, it plays a crucial role in specific regions. This study examines data from an energy monitoring system installed on a double-ended Estonian ferry over the period from 2022 to 2024. The empirical results clearly show that targeted adjustments can lead to substantial fuel consumption reductions as the optimal operation of the vessel requires equal power from the aft and fore engines particularly when operating under cold or icy conditions. Additionally, the research finds that real-time energy monitoring together with integrating environmental factors supports energy efficiency and fulfilling regulatory requirements. The analysis reveals that environmental corrections and balanced decision-making can generate fuel savings and extended emission reductions. The suggested framework offers ferry operators practical and economical ways of meeting sustainability requirements.

TI  - The Future of Wind Power Plants in Indonesia: Potential, Challenges, and Policies
AB  - Energy is one of the essential human needs that plays a crucial role in achieving sustainable development. Indonesia is among the countries that are highly focused on developing renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net-zero emissions. In addition, the government has launched various policies and programs to promote the use of renewable energy, such as increased investment in biomass, geothermal, and solar power generation. Wind energy stands out as a sufficient, widely available, and an environmentally friendly alternative in renewable energy. In 2021, the Indonesian Energy Outlook highlights that Indonesia has an energy potential of 154.9 gigawatts (GWs). It is associated with minimal emissions of greenhouse gases during its operation and does not demand vast tracts of land. However, the actual installed capacity of wind power plants is at a modest 157.41 megawatts (MWs). Meanwhile, the targeted capacity is 255 MWs for 2025. One significant factor contributing to this lower-than-expected capacity is a lack of in-depth research into the potential of wind energy. Consequently, the primary aim of this paper is to conduct a thorough examination of the wind energy potential in Indonesia. This includes an analysis of the current state of both existing and upcoming power plants, as well as a review of recent studies conducted by Indonesian researchers on wind turbines. Furthermore, this paper explores the government program to encourage the sustainable development of wind power plants. It also explains various aspects including the untapped wind energy potential, the interference in developing wind power plants, and the strategy to harness the full potential of abundant renewable resources in Indonesia. Through an in-depth investigation of the potential of wind energy, this review aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the current conditions and prospects of wind power plants in Indonesia as well as contribute to a more accurate mapping of wind energy potential and more targeted development, specifically in remote areas, outer islands, and borders. The results obtained are expected to support Indonesia's energy transition toward more environmentally friendly and sustainable renewable energy sources, thereby reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

TI  - Transforming ports for a low-carbon future: Innovations, challenges, and opportunities
AB  - The need to cut carbon emissions has placed global ports in a strategic position regarding the fight against climate change. This paper reviews the challenges, technological innovations, and opportunities that face efforts to retool ports into low-carbon operation centers. Ports are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions through vessel-related activities and operational processes. Improved international legislation, including a plan of action put forward by the International Maritime Organization, shoreside power supply, alternative fuels, and other green technologies are major propellers to new port design changes. The paper calls for cooperation from all stakeholders, applies holistic methods of valuation through data envelopment analysis and life cycle assessment, and discusses integration with smart technologies. Case studies of leading global ports-including the European Union Green Ports Program and the Belt and Road Initiative-underline how the goal for a hub of innovation in sustainable maritime logistics can be attained. Global coordinated action, full policy support, and institutional collaboration at all levels can make this goal of carbon reduction targets achievable in a balance with economic growth and environmental responsibility.

TI  - Clean Propulsion Technologies: Securing Technological Dominance for the Finnish Marine and Off-Road Powertrain Sectors
AB  - The Clean Propulsion Technologies (CPT) project, established in 2021, brought together 15 research partners and original equipment manufacturers. The goal was to create a common vision and sustainable business solutions so that the worldwide technological leadership of the Finnish powertrain industry is secured. With a EUR 15.5 M budget, CPT brought early-stage innovative concepts towards technology readiness level (TRL) 6. The project's particular significance was its unique cross-coupling of marine and off-road sectors, which have similar emission reduction targets but which do not compete for similar customers. The project yielded 21 innovative solutions, from accelerated model-based design methodologies and progress in combustion and aftertreatment control to hybrid energy management solutions. These were encapsulated in four ground-breaking demonstrations, including a next-generation marine engine working in low-temperature, reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) mode and a hydrogen off-road engine. An advanced close-coupled selective catalyst reduction (SCR) system and a hybrid wheel-platform with digital hydraulics were also demonstrated. The University of Vaasa led the consortium and was responsible for coordinated model-based rapid prototyping. This report examines University of Vaasa's achievements during the CPT in terms of 26 milestones, 13 deliverables, and 32 research papers. It focuses also on other aspects, including lessons learned from managing large-scale academic-industry research.

TI  - The role of regional grid connectivity and cooperation for Decarbonisation: A case study of South and South East Asia
AB  - As the share of renewable energy expands, cooperation at a wider level is required. In South Asia (SA) and Southeast Asia (SEA), cross-border power trade already exists. Both regions are moving toward high levels of integration. Sub-regional and interregional interconnections and regional cooperation can help reduce the use of fossil fuels and increase the absorption of renewable power in power systems. Using optimization models for the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) countries, the article demonstrates significant CO2 savings (403 million tonnes) resulting from the renewable Energy (RE) potential of Bhutan, India, and Nepal, meeting the required electricity demand for GDP growth. In South Asia, each country can benefit from trading, meeting their demand, and decarbonizing at a lower cost. Similarly, the countries of the SEA region can also grow. By 2050, the power generation in the SA and SEA regions can reach 5880 and 5681 Terra-Watt-hours (TWh), respectively. Smaller countries with large potential for RE, such as Bhutan, Nepal, Laos, and Myanmar, can export electricity and grow economically as they cannot use that much for their needs. Regional grid connectivity can provide additional benefits due to further trade opportunities arising from differences in time, seasons, costs, prices, resource diversity, and availability.

TI  - The impact of Fit for 55 on Ireland's maritime transport sector and the macroeconomy
AB  - The European Green Deal aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55\% by 2030 and achieve a carbon neutral economy by 2050. The `Fit for 55 package' includes a suite of new regulations and taxes to promote Renewable and Low Carbon Fuels (RLFs) in the maritime transport sector. We use a Vector Autoregressive model (VAR) to forecast the impact of higher marine fuel prices during the transition to RLFs on Ireland's maritime transport sector and the broader Irish economy. Our analysis finds that higher marine fuel prices are expected to reduce Gross Value Added (GVA) in the maritime transport sector by nearly 8\% by 2050, relative to a ``no-policy-change{''} baseline. Our results indicate that fuel price increases will not have a material impact on overall economic activity. The negative impact on real output is projected to range from 0.09\% in 2025 to 1.21\% in 2050. The projected decline in real exports ranges from 0.17\% in 2025 to 2.29\% in 2050, while consumer prices will increase from 0.13\% in 2025 to 1.72\% in 2050.

TI  - Merging Multiple System Perspectives: The Key to Effective Inland Shipping Emission-Reduction Policy Design
AB  - Policymakers in the maritime sector face the challenge of designing and implementing decarbonization policies while maintaining safe navigation. Herein, the inland sector serves as a promising stepping stone due to the possibility of creating a dense energy supply infrastructure and shorter distances compared to marine shipping. A key challenge is to consider the totality of all operational profiles as a result of the range of vessels and routes encountering varying local circumstances. In this study, we use a new scheme called ``event table{''} to transform big data on vessel trajectories (AIS data) combined with energy-estimating algorithms into shipping-emission outcomes that can be evaluated from multiple perspectives. We can subsequently tie observations in one perspective (for example, large-scale spatial patterns on a map) to supporting explanations based on another perspective (for example, water currents, vessel speeds, or engine ages and their contributions to emissions). Hence, combining these outcomes from multiple perspectives and evaluation scales provides an essential understanding of how the system works and what the most effective improvement measures will be. With our approach, we can translate large quantities of data from multiple sources into multiple linked perspectives on the shipping system.

TI  - An innovative Configuration of ammonia fuel Cell-Based Polygeneration system for maritime applications
AB  - Decarbonizing the maritime transport sector is a top priority for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce environmental impacts and combat global warming. One innovative solution for reducing carbon emissions is using fuel cells in ship propulsion systems. This study focuses on a system that combines a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with ammonia fuel to produce power, cooling, heating, and purified water simultaneously. The system requires 2 MW of power for navigation, which is supplied by the SOFC, and an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) with pentane fluid. Cooling needs are met by a vapor compression refrigeration (VCR) cycle, and clean drinking water is produced through a reverse osmosis (RO) unit. The study includes comprehensive analyses of energy, exergy, and economics, with a sensitivity analysis identifying key system parameters. The efficiency of the system is noted at 58.09 \% with a total exergy destruction of 5.34 MW. The economic analysis shows a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of 27.51 US\$/MWh. Risk calculations have been performed for the proposed system and the total risk is estimated to be 5.82 x 10-6 casualty per year. The sensitivity analysis highlights the impact of current density, cell area, and fuel cell count on efficiency and costs.

TI  - WHR systems based on sCO2 gas turbines for marine applications: The effect of route environmental conditions on performance
AB  - Waste Heat Recovery is one of the viable solutions to enhance the global efficiency of propulsion and energy systems in marine applications, thus mitigating and reducing the greenhouse gas emission from shipping. In this context, WHR systems based on supercritical CO2 Brayon Cycle are considered an emerging and interesting technology. The aim of this study is to investigate the off-design behaviour of an integrated energy system based on a commercial gas turbine (LM2500+) and a bottoming partially preheated and recuperated sCO2 gas turbine, considering the variations in environmental conditions, that a vessel may encounter along commercial routes. In particular, an energy, environmental and exergetic numerical analysis has been carried out considering two different routes connecting Europe (the departure port is Naples in Southern Italy) to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), passing or not through the Suez Canal. The same routes have been considered in two different seasons (March 2024 and August/September 2024), to underline the effect of air and seawater temperatures on the overall performance of the integrated system. The steady-state thermodynamic analysis has been carried out using the commercial software Thermoflex. The results of the analysis highlighted that the overall efficiency of the system can vary up to 11 \% in the same location, in different seasons and can reach a value closed to 49 \%, dropping to 42 \% in the worst-case scenario. At the same time, the efficiency of WHR can change up to 40-47 \% in the same location under different environmental conditions considered.

TI  - Exploring the role of saline water splitting in sustainable energy solutions and hydrogen economy
AB  - The use of seawater for hydrogen production via electrolysis is a significant step toward a sustainable hydrogen economy. Over the past decade, research has highlighted the importance of seawater electrolysis (SWE) in future hydrogen infrastructure. This review emphasizes recent advancements in SWE technology that position hydrogen as a bio-inert energy carrier to support renewable energy integration for climate action and carbon neutrality. The key challenges in saline water splitting (SWS), such as seawater's corrosive effects on catalysts and the competing chlorine and oxygen evolution reactions that reduce efficiency, are critically examined. Advancements in electrocatalysis are summarized as a promising approach to developing efficient and corrosion-resistant catalysts for SWS. Catalysts with exceptional hydrogen evolution coupled with low chlorine evolution activities can significantly enhance the performance and economic potential. Significant challenges in SWS, including catalyst scaling and the presence of chloride ions are elaborated and recent developments to overcome these challenges are briefed along with positioning SWS as a promising and sustainable method for hydrogen production. By addressing the multifaceted technical and economic challenges, coupling SWS with industrial process and renewable energy sources could play a pivotal role in meeting future energy demands sustainably, thereby contributing to global efforts in combating climate change and promoting renewable energy solutions.

TI  - The potential of repurposing offshore natural gas infrastructure on the Dutch Continental Shelf for hydrogen production and transport
AB  - Climate change becoming an increasingly pressing issue worldwide necessitates a transition from fossil fuels to clean and renewable energy. In line with this, the Netherlands aims to install 21 GW offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 72 GW by 2050. Transporting this substantial amount of energy to shore could be challenging, concerning high electricity transmission costs and onshore grid congestion problems. Offshore hydrogen production could pose a potential solution pathway to transport offshore wind power to shore. Based on the projected decommissioning of large amounts of offshore natural gas infrastructure in the future, this study explored the potential of repurposing said infrastructure on the Dutch Continental Shelf for green hydrogen production and transport. In this study we found platform (topsides) weight to be the limiting factor for the maximum electrolyzer capacity that could fit on a platform. Based on that criteria we found 84 potential natural gas platforms that could accommodate PEM electrolysis systems of various capacities. Considering a range of PEM electrolyzer system weights, the total potential electrolysis capacity that those 84 platforms can accommodate, amounted to between 23 and 42 GW, with most platforms potentially being able to transport hydrogen with their existing pipelines at a pressure between 50 and 60 bar. Promising synergies were found between nearby offshore platforms and future wind farms in the areas known as Nederwiek Noord and Nederwiek Zuid.

TI  - Numerical Study on the Mechanism of Stoichiometric Combustion Knock in Marine Natural Gas Low-Carbon Engines in Rapid Compression Machine Combustion Chambers
AB  - The vigorous development of marine engines fueled by natural gas can effectively support the reform of energy structures in the field of ship power, aligning with the global trend toward sustainable development and green shipping. However, the presence of knock significantly hinders the improvement of engine thermal efficiency. Therefore, studying the knock mechanism in natural gas engines is not only crucial for enhancing engine power and economy but also for advancing the transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources in the maritime industry. In this paper, via a 2D numerical model, the dominant role in the knock mechanism of stoichiometric methane combustion in a combustion chamber of a rapid compression machine (RCM) is revealed. It further establishes the association mechanism between constant-volume combustion and pressure wave suppression at high temperatures. The results show that the knock is caused by the end-gas auto-ignition. The increase in initial temperature can significantly change auto-ignition modes and combustion modes, but initial pressure has little effect on this. The increase in initial temperature will inhibit the strength of pressure waves, and the increase in initial pressure cannot significantly increase the strength of pressure waves. The main cause why auto-ignition occurs earlier is not due to the increase in the strength of pressure waves, but the decrease in the required increase in temperature to attain ignition temperature caused by the increase in initial temperature. The peak pressure is affected by the initial pressure on the left wall before auto-ignition and the increase in pressure on the left wall at low to medium initial temperature. The pressure oscillation amplitude is positively correlated to the increase in pressure on the left wall. Constant volume combustion will occur at a high initial temperature. The increase and decrease in pressure are very uniform which will lead to the decrease in the pressure oscillation amplitude. The peak pressure depends on the influence of initial temperature and pressure on the increase in pressure produced by constant volume combustion.

TI  - Conversion of coastal marsh to aquaculture ponds decreased the potential of methane production by altering soil chemical properties and methanogenic archaea community structure
AB  - Coastal wetlands are among the most productive and dynamic ecosystems globally, contributing significantly to atmospheric methane (CH4) emissions. The widespread conversion of these wetlands into aquaculture ponds degrades these ecosystems, yet its effects on CH4 production and associated microbial mechanisms are not well understood. This study aimed to assess the impact of land conversion on CH4 production potential, total and active soil organic C (SOC) content, and microbial communities. We conducted a comparative study on three brackish marshes and adjacent aquaculture ponds in southeastern China. Compared to costal marshes, aquaculture ponds exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) lower CH4 production potential (0.05 vs. 0.02 mu g kg(-1) h(-1)), SOC (17.64 vs. 6.97 g kg(-1)), total nitrogen (TN) content (1.62 vs. 1.24 g kg(-1)) and carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio (10.85 vs. 5.66). CH4 production potential in aquaculture ponds was influenced by both microbial and abiotic factors. Specifically, the relative abundance of Methanosarcina slightly decreased in aquaculture ponds, while the potential for CH4 production declined with lower SOC contents and C/N ratio. Overall, our findings demonstrate that converting natural coastal marshes into aquaculture ponds reduces CH4 production by altering key soil properties and the structure and diversity of methanogenic archaea communities. These results provide empirical evidence to enhance global carbon models, improving predictions of carbon feedback from wetland land conversion in the context of climate change.

TI  - Sustainable Fuel Supply for Very Small Island Transportation: The Potential of Hybrid Renewable Energy and Green Hydrogen
AB  - The transition to a low-carbon future necessitates innovative approaches to renewable energy deployment, particularly in the marine environment, where abundant resources remain underutilized. This paper explores the potential of hybrid renewable energy systems and green hydrogen production to address the energy challenges faced by Very Small Islands (VSIs). These islands heavily rely on imported fossil fuels, making them vulnerable to global price fluctuations and contributing to economic instability and environmental degradation. Offshore floating platforms present a transformative opportunity by harnessing marine renewable resources, integrating wind, solar, and wave energy to maximize energy production while minimizing land use conflicts. Green hydrogen, produced through the electrolysis of seawater, powered by these renewable sources, offers a sustainable alternative for decarbonizing transportation, particularly in the maritime sector. The study aims to assess the feasibility of converting small conventional passenger vessels to hydrogen propulsion and evaluate the technical, economic, and environmental impacts of deploying offshore platforms for hydrogen production. By examining these aspects, this research contributes to the broader discourse on sustainable energy solutions for island communities and provides actionable insights into implementing renewable hydrogen-based maritime transport.

TI  - China's Blue Carbon Plan and Carbon Reduction Along the Belt and Road and Asia Pacific Region
AB  - The China's Blue Carbon Plan has made substantial strides since its inception in 2014 and has garnered positive feedback from the domestic surgical technology sector throughout its implementation. This initiative plays a pivotal role in China's goals for carbon peak and carbon neutrality. This paper employs data from the Belt and Road Initiative and 62 Asia-Pacific countries spanning 2005 to 2021 and applies the PSM-DID method to empirically assess the impact of China's Blue Carbon Plan on the carbon emissions of Belt and Road and Asia-Pacific countries. The results show that (1) Blue Carbon Plan can promote carbon emission reduction and per capita carbon emission reduction in the Belt and Road countries and countries in the Asia Pacific region; (2) Blue Carbon Plan can reduce the future carbon emissions of the Belt and Road countries and countries in the Asia Pacific region, but the policy effect shows a certain weakening trend; (3) Blue Carbon Plan can reduce national carbon emissions through four pathways: fishery aquaculture production, fishery fishing production, fishery trade volume and ship fuel consumption. These results provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of blue carbon initiatives and underscore the potential of scaling up such policies to achieve broader regional and global carbon reduction targets.

TI  - Polyurea/hydrogen-bonded reduced graphene oxide composite coating with self-repairing functions for applications of anti-cavitation and anti-corrosion
AB  - Cavitation and corrosion critically influence the behavior of offshore engineering equipment's dynamic components. To solve this problem, a polyurea coating (H-DAPU) with cavitation resistance, corrosion protection, and self-repairing capabilities based on DA bonds was successfully prepared. The coating has the triple effects of anti-cavitation, anti-corrosion, and self-repairing by adding 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl isocyanate-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (HRGO) to the polyurea coating (soft segment molecular weight is 650 g/mol, and the content of the hard segment is 40 wt\%) with the optimal mechanical properties. The excellent compatibility between HRGO and the polyurea coating increases H-DAPU's stress resistance by 8 MPa compared to the prototype. The coating's superior mechanical properties significantly enhance its anti-cavitation property. After 48 h of continuous cavitation, the mass loss of H-DAP is 6.3 mg, 37.6 \% higher than that of the prototype. Additionally, the barrier effect of HRGO enables H-DAPU to have excellent corrosion protection. After 10 days of exposure to 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution, the low-frequency modal value of H-DAPU is still 3.2 x 107 Omega \& sdot;cm2. Finally, H-DAPU exhibited excellent photothermal healing ability, achieving 92.2 \% self-repair efficiency under NIR exposure for 60 s. This research provides a new method for enhancing long-lasting corrosion protection in offshore engineering equipment's power components.

TI  - Poly(Acid Yellow 17)-Modified CoFe-Layered Double Hydroxide Achieves Long-Term Alkaline Seawater Oxidation
AB  - Seawater electrolysis powered by renewable energy is a promising technique for green hydrogen production. However, the high concentration of chloride ions (Cl-) and their derivatives in seawater can severely corrode the anode catalyst, significantly challenging the lifespan of electrolyzers. Herein, we present a poly(acid yellow 17) (PAY) layer-modified CoFe-layered double hydroxide nanoarrays on nickel foam (CoFe LDH@PAY/NF), which serves as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for alkaline seawater oxidation (ASO). PAY layer functions as an electrically conductive layer, which significantly enhances the conductivity of CoFe LDH/NF and thus improves the catalytic activity of ASO. Moreover, the sulfonic acid groups of PAY create a negatively charged environment on the surface of CoFe LDH/NF, effectively repelling Cl-, while the chlorine atoms in PAY form a Cl--free protective layer on the surface. These two mechanisms work synergistically to stabilize the seawater electrolysis process. Electrochemical test data indicate that CoFe LDH@PAY/NF achieves a current density of 1000 mA cm-2 at just 336 mV for ASO. The CoFe LDH@PAY/NF demonstrated superb stability, exhibiting slight activity degradation after 800 h ASO under 1000 mA cm-2. This work provides important guidance for developing anode catalysts resistant to Cl- corrosion during the ASO process.

TI  - Immobilized Chlorella salina for removing nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds from mariculture tail water
AB  - The rapid development of the maricultural industry has brought both economic benefits and environmental challenges. One such challenge is the purification of mariculture tail water (MTW), which has become a key issue of marine environmental protection. Meanwhile, immobilized algal beads (IAB), has received growing attention as cost-effective wastewater treatment technology. However, most of the studies on the treatment of aquaculture tail water by IAB focus on the application of freshwater, and the use of seawater remains relatively rare. This study investigated the screening of algal species and embedding particle size suitable for the treatment of artificial MTW-I, the optimization of algal beads preparation using the response surface method, and their application in treating artificial MTW-II. The results showed that immobilized Chlorella salina harbouring particle size of 3.2 mm were most effective for removing N from artificial MTW-I. IAB fabricated under the optimized conditions of 4.2 \% (w/v) sodium alginate (SA), 1 x 107 cells \& sdot;mL- 1 initial density of C. salina and 130 mL algal cells volume achieved the highest NH4-N removal efficiency (75.780 \%) during the 72 h experiment. Although immobilized cultivation inhibited algal cell photosynthesis, it also promoted their growth and NH4-N removal ability. Groups with 10 \% algal beads exhibited a better purification effect and could treat 5 batches of artificial MTW-II containing 815.75 mg of inorganic nitrogen and 71.80 mg of phosphate. Furthermore, the addition of 2 \% algal beads was the most cost-effective scheme, resulting in a treatment cost of approximately 3.50 RMB per ton of tail water and 0.33 RMB per gram of inorganic nitrogen. These findings provide unique insight into marine environmental protection and suggest that IAB application offers a promising method for integrated MTW treatment.

TI  - Techno-environmental optimal sizing and dynamic behavior of a hybrid system feeding a large-scale SWRO desalination system: The case of Djerba Island, Tunisia
AB  - The environment, energy, and water are the three essential pillars of sustainable development. In light of the freshwater scarcity faced by numerous countries, desalination emerges as a practical solution. As a result, countries are increasingly establishing desalination facilities along their coastlines. However, these initiatives are energy-intensive, and their chosen locations may not be optimal for harnessing renewable energy resources. With a daily output capacity of 50,000 m3, the recently operational seawater desalination plant in Djerba, Tunisia, accounts for 13.6\% of the region's total electrical energy consumption. In this study, we have considered both the specific and the overall desalination consumption to find the optimal architecture and assess the reliability of the hybrid energy generator supplying the unit. The economic optimization has been performed using hybrid optimization of multiple energy resources, and the dynamic study of the complete system has been achieved using the transient system simulation tool environment. On- and off-grid scenarios using various hybrid power system combinations with and without batteries were proposed and examined. Results showed that the optimum case consists of on-grid 60.513 MWp solar panels and 13.64 MW wind turbines with battery storage. The water produced by the most cost-effective strategy with regard to environmental protection for a 25-year project life cycle costs 0.414 \$/m3 against 0.585 \$/m3 for current consumption. This significant reduction in water production costs makes desalination more affordable and accessible. The dynamic behavior of the optimal architecture is designed by considering the real meteorological data of Djerba Island. In terms of productivity, the maximum photovoltaic and wind energy production reached 11.31 GWh in July and 0.51 GWh in April, respectively. The findings demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of powering large-scale desalination plants with hybrid renewable energy systems, reducing their environmental impact and energy costs. The optimal system proposed in this study can serve as a model for future desalination projects in Tunisia and other water-scarce regions.

TI  - Research Progress on Key Technologies to Prevent and Control Floating Bodies That May Impair Cooling in Nuclear-Power-Plant Thermal Traps
AB  - With the transformation of the world's energy structure and the promotion of clean energy, nuclear power has come to the fore as an efficient and environmentally friendly form of energy. As critical components in the operation of nuclear power plants (NPPs), suction and transportation devices for thermal traps-designed to prevent and control floating bodies-are directly linked to the safety of power generation, the stability of operations, and the reliability of the power grid in NPPs. Technical research and advancements in these devices play a crucial role in enhancing their effectiveness. In view of the intrusion and blockage of floating bodies in the sewage network pocket of the water intake with the cold-source system for coastal NPPs, the key technologies to prevent and control floating bodies that may impair cooling resources in NPPs' thermal traps is discussed. This paper introduces the safety risks and social impacts associated with water intake, highlights the importance of the water-intake system, and discusses the interception and transportation mechanisms in NPPs. The progress of explosive floating bodies' interception, cleaning, suction, transportation, and intelligent monitoring technology is introduced through the technical progress in the types of floating bodies, as well as cutting, crushing, suction, and transportation devices. The technical progress of efficient treatment is realized, which provides reference for the research and practice of the key technologies for suction and transportation devices to prevent and control floating bodies' suction and transportation devices in NPPs' thermal traps.

TI  - Economic feasibility of floating offshore solar farms. The case of study of the Levantine-Balearic region of Spain
AB  - This paper examines the economic feasibility of offshore floating solar farms by evaluating key financial parameters, including capital expenditure (CAPEX), operating expenditure (OPEX) and offshore solar power generation. These factors are used to calculate the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR). The study focuses on the Levantine-Balearic region of Spain, applying these methods to the Merganser floating offshore solar platform. To improve accuracy, several spatial and regulatory constraints were taken into account, such as bathymetry (50-200 m), Spanish Maritime Land Management (POEM), fishing grounds, power and telecommunication cables, marine protected areas, Natura 2000 Network, biosphere reserves and priority areas for biodiversity and national defence. The results highlight the importance of incorporating spatial constraints when assessing the economic viability of marine solar farms. The analysis identifies six high potential areas (i.e., four in the Levantine region and two in the Balearic region), where floating solar farms show the greatest viability. These data provide valuable guidance to investors and policy makers to optimize site selection and investment strategies.

TI  - Defining the Power and Energy Demands from Ships at Anchorage for Offshore Power Supply Solutions
AB  - The maritime industry, following several conventions, regulations, and initiatives, is trying to adapt and limit its GHG and other local polluting emissions. A crucial aspect of these decarbonisation efforts is the provision of electric energy to vessels, either in port or stationed at anchorages. The latter prevents the option of receiving shore power to support their needs without operating their generators. Research and innovation efforts are attempting to fill this gap through several technology options. This study focuses on the systematic definition of the power and energy demands at anchorage to drive the design of such solutions, focusing on the materialisation of a modular and scalable power barge serving as an offshore power supply solution. Data for various ports and ship types were collected and analysed properly to extract significant insights. Results formulated baselines, per ship type and port, to be used for selecting power modules' configurations and meeting these demands. This study, considering the lack of industry data regarding power demand, relies on existing studies, guidelines, and other literature to define power demand, which in turn introduces a great deal of uncertainty. Thus, a detailed statistical analysis was employed, together with probability modelling, in order to limit the uncertainty and provide a baseline for the power and energy demands to be verified by future studies capitalising on the accumulation of actual industry data.

TI  - Advances and challenges in assessing submarine landslide risks to marine infrastructure
AB  - Submarine landslides, as a significant marine geological phenomenon, pose substantial risks to underwater construction projects such as offshore oil and gas exploitation, submarine pipelines and cables, offshore wind power installations, and even coastal engineering. However, existing reviews on submarine landslides primarily focus on summarizing their triggering mechanisms and flow characteristics from the perspective of the landslides themselves, while rarely addressing their impact on ocean engineering applications, which lacks practical significance. Therefore, following an in-depth analysis of the fundamental characteristics, mechanisms of occurrence, and relevant influencing factors of submarine landslides, this study provides an in-depth exploration into the potential impact of submarine landslides on marine infrastructure through illustrative examples of past submarine landslide incidents. Additionally, it proposes risk assessment methodologies as well as monitoring and mitigation strategies for related projects. The key findings from our research are as follows: (1) There is an urgent need to establish a unified classification standard for types of submarine landslides instead of continuously refining their categorization; (2) The primary distinction between marine engineering and land-based engineering lies in the complex marine dynamic environment that necessitates considerations such as geological conditions, environmental factors, and structural design; (3) Current measures to prevent submarine landslide disasters in marine engineering primarily focus on avoiding hazardous areas during the design and exploration stages, with limited emphasis on post-landslide disaster prevention and mitigation measures; (4) Existing field investigation techniques for studying submarine landslides predominantly concentrate on basic research aimed at identifying already existing occurrences but lack industrial applicability due to being mostly experimental single-object monitoring approaches; (5) Numerical models used to simulate submarine landslides often oversimplify the phenomenon's complexity hindering practical project applications. Henceforth, it is crucial to consider macro-micro interconnected effects when simulating the evolution of underwater landslide movements.

TI  - A Stackelberg game-based multi-time scale optimization for hybrid power ship and port
AB  - Multi-energy ships are considered as a promising alternative for addressing marine pollution issues. However, the effects of source-load prediction errors on ship energy systems under multi-time scale have been rarely studied. To address this, a hybrid power ship that integrates a diesel generator, photovoltaic cells, hydrogen fuel cell and energy storage is established to meet the electrical, thermal, and cooling demands. Furthermore, to enhance energy efficiency and multi-energy interaction, equipment for electrical-to-thermal, electrical-to-cooling, and thermal-to-cooling conversions is integrated into the hybrid power ship. Then, a multi-time scale optimization model considering multi-energy complementary plan is proposed. In the day-ahead scheduling, a Stackelberg game model, in which the leader is responsible for setting electricity prices for cold-ironing and the energy management of the ship is determined by the follower, is established. Theoretical analysis regarding the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium point is provided. Accordingly, a distributed iterative algorithm with faster convergence speed is proposed to achieve Stackelberg equilibrium. Subsequently, according to the response time of energy adjustment, the results of thermal/cooling and electricity energies are refined by rolling optimization in intra-day and real-time stages, respectively, to reduce the prediction errors from photovoltaic cells and loads. Comparison results with an existing distributed iterative algorithm demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster convergence. In addition, the multi-time scale optimization model is conducive to enhance the reliability of ship operations, mitigating the effects of prediction errors in supply and demand.

TI  - Design of a Submarine 30-km MgB2 Cable for the Combined Transfer of 0.3 GWe and LH2 from Offshore Plants to the Ravenna Port
AB  - A submarine, hybrid cable for the simultaneous transfer of green electricity and Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) in a 30 km-long pipeline from an offshore renewable power plant, in the Adriatic Sea is presented here. The superconducting (SC) cable is designed with MgB2 strands to carry the transport current with a significant margin. The SC strands are twisted around a bundle of normal conducting strands with the function of protecting against overcurrents and ensuring at the same time flexibility of the cable. The SC cable, covered by multiple layers of cold dielectric, is inserted into a corrugated pipe, constituting the inner part of a cryostat where LH2 flows. LH2 has the dual function of cryogen and energy carrier. The outer part of the cryostat is designed to limit the heat load to less than 2 W/m, and to withstand the pressure in operation due to the submarine installation at a maximum depth of similar to 50 m.

TI  - Impact of mean stress on mooring line fatigue assessment: An analytical study
AB  - Mean stress significantly impacts material fatigue behaviour, extending lifetimes under compressive loads and reducing them under tensile loads. Mooring systems experience complex, dynamic loads, with lines continuously under tension. This tension introduces a tractive mean load influenced by various factors, including environmental conditions and design pretension. Despite the critical role of mean stresses in the structural integrity of mooring lines and its contribution to fatigue damage, standard offshore mooring design procedures do not explicitly account for their effects. Numerous studies have investigated mean stress effects in fatigue, resulting in various correction methods. This study presents a systematic approach to incorporate mean stress into mooring system design, evaluating six common correction methods (i.e., Goodman, Gerber, Soderberg, Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT), Morrow, and Kwofie) against the DNV offshore specification. The findings underscore the importance of accounting for mean stress, which can reduce estimated lifetimes by up to 50\%. Furthermore, selecting a correction method tailored to material-specific responses is essential as estimations vary significantly. Experimental data indicate that the SWT method provides the most accurate results among those tested.

TI  - Increased but not pristine soil organic carbon stocks in restored ecosystems
AB  - Ecosystem restoration can contribute to climate change mitigation, as recovering ecosystems sequester atmospheric CO2 in biomass and soils. It is, however, unclear how much soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks recover across different restored ecosystems. Here, we show SOC recovery in different contexts globally by consolidating 41 meta-analyses into a second-order meta-analysis. We find that restoration projects have, since their inception, led to significant SOC increases compared to the degraded state in 12 out of 16 ecosystem-previous land-use combinations, with mean SOC increases thus far that range from 25% (grasslands; 10â€“39%, 95% CI) to 79% (shrublands; 38â€“120% CI). Yet, we observe a SOC deficit in restored ecosystems compared to pristine sites, ranging from 14% (forests; 12â€“16% CI) to 50% (wetlands; 14â€“87% CI). While restoration does increase carbon sequestration in SOC, it should not be viewed as a way to fully offset carbon losses in natural ecosystems, whose conservation has priority.

TI  - Comparison of a Full-Scale and a 1:10 Scale Low-Speed Two-Stroke Marine Engine Using Computational Fluid Dynamics
AB  - International marine shipping is a growing component of international trade; a vast majority of all the world's goods are being transported on large ocean-going vessels. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced the Energy Efficiency Design Index in 2013, a regulatory framework of associated metrics for reducing emissions of CO2 per tonne-mile from shipping by approximately 10% each decade. Therefore, decarbonizing the maritime sector requires the development of new fuel sources. Because of the extremely large physical size of the internal combustion engines present in shipping vessels, experimental iterative development of the engine and fuel system is cost-prohibitive. Thus, the ability to perform combustion system development in a scaled platform that can be more easily operated and modeled computationally is of interest. To that end, scaling relationships are needed to translate the results from a smaller engine to a larger counterpart. Scaling studies to date have been restricted to low scaling ratios, four-stroke light-duty engines, and under-resolved computational fluid dynamic simulations that likely do not accurately capture the physics of scaling. In this work, computational models of a 1:10 scale and a full-scale two-stroke crosshead low-speed marine engine were created and validated against experiments obtained in a real 1:10 scale engine installed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Due to the large size of the full-scale engine, the model required large high-performance computing resources to be evaluated. The availability of high-performance computing resources at the Department of Energy's Leadership Computing Facilities is an enabler of the current work. The results of the small-and large-scale engine simulations were compared to analyze the effectiveness of the appropriate scaling laws under these extreme scaling ratio conditions.

TI  - Blue carbon potential of oyster: Review of global oyster production and annual growth rate
AB  - Oysters have been considered as an important candidate for blue carbon due to their ability to store carbon through calcification. This study aims to compare the growth of major cultured oyster species for effective carbon sequestration and determine the impact of climate change on oyster growth. The results showed that suspended cultured Crassostrea angulata and Magallana gigas had high carbon sequestration potential efficiencies (CSE) of 2.98 and 2.89, while bottom cultured Ostrea edulis had the lowest CSE of 1.03. Oysters' optimal growth sea surface temperature (SST) was 24â€“28 â„ƒ, and the optimal salinity was around 25psu. Comparing past and present M. gigas growth with a 1 â„ƒ increase in SST due to climate change did not show significant differences. However, mortality increased dramatically due to the rise in diseases caused by climate change. This study supports global oyster management and conservation efforts while contributing to essential biological data collection. Â© 2025 The Authors

TI  - Cadmium and rising tides: Amplified greenhouse gas emissions from mangrove sediment
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems, renowned for their carbon sequestration capabilities, also contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases from their sediments. They are under stress from human activities and global changes, such as heavy metal pollution and rising sea levels, which can affect carbon stability and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the combined impact of these factors is not fully understood to date. This study assessed the impact of cadmium contamination at varying levels of inundation depths on the emission of CO2, N2O, and CH4 from mangrove sediments. The findings indicated that increased inundation depth intensifies the effect of low cadmium concentrations on CO2 emissions, with sediment CO2 flux doubling from 3430 Î¼mol mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1 to 6720 Î¼mol mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1. In contrast, deeper water levels reduced N2O emissions in the presence of high cadmium concentrations, lowering sediment N2O flux from 14.10 Î¼mol mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1 to 10.13 Î¼mol mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1. These results highlight that the combined effects of rising inundation depth and cadmium pollution can enhance greenhouse gas emissions from mangrove sediments. It is crucial to consider the synergistic effects of pollution and rising sea levels on the stability of sediment carbon and gas emission rates in the conservation and management of mangroves. Such assessments will bolster efforts to protect blue carbon and achieve carbon neutrality in the future. Â© 2025 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Carbon capture and storage via enhanced carbonate weathering coupled with aquatic photosynthesis: Potential, cost, and advantages
AB  - The application of crushed rock powders to terrestrial or marine ecosystems (termed enhanced rock weathering, ERW) is regarded as an effective carbon dioxide removal (CDR) mechanism for mitigating ongoing climate change. As a potential ERW material, carbonate is characterized by rapid dissolution kinetics and is environmentally friendly. However, the CDR potential, cost, and effectiveness of carbonate-based ERW implementation are not well explored. Using a carbonate equilibrium equation, and the CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) GCM (Global Climate Model) and LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) models, here we analyze the CDR potential, carbon footprint, and cost of a carbonate-based RW strategy (so-called enhanced carbonate weathering, ECW). We estimated that the current global potential carbon removal (PCR) of ECW could reach âˆ¼2.66 (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5) and âˆ¼ 2.82 (RCP8.5) Gt CO2 aâˆ’1, and that the cumulative CO2 removal by the end of this century could reach 241.32 Gt CO2 aâˆ’1 (RCP4.5) and 246.64 Gt CO2 aâˆ’1 (RCP8.5). This could potentially neutralize âˆ¼23.11 % (RCP4.5) and âˆ¼ 23.62 % (RCP8.5) of future global carbon dioxide emissions. We also found that the global CDR potential of ECW can respond sensitively to global environmental perturbations, and that the CDR potential in the future will generally increase in high-latitude regions due to global climate change. We compared the cost of enhanced silicate weathering (ESW) with ECW implementations for seven major countries with high CDR potential and found that the cost per mol of CO2 removal by ECW is 1.33â€“2.07 times lower than that for ESW. While the stability of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is debated in many studies, we suggest that the new approach represented by ECW should consider the role of aquatic photosynthesis. Overall, the biological pump induced by aquatic photosynthesis is significant for increasing the carbon storage of ECW in inland waters. For future ERW implementation, we stress the need to develop an Enhanced Coupled Carbonate Weathering plus aquatic photosynthesis strategy (ECCW) that can both offset the negative effect of CO2 degassing and also increase the total CDR of ECW to a greater degree than expected. ECCW remains in the developmental stage, and its large-scale implementation requires further laboratory and field experiments to determine its CDR-efficiency and environmental effects and risks.

TI  - Multi-criteria decision-making for green maritime transportation: A hybrid Fuzzy AHP-MOORA approach to reduce marine pollution
AB  - The maritime industry faces increasing pressure to adopt sustainable transportation solutions due to stringent IMO regulations and growing environmental concerns. However, a lack of structured, multi-criteria decision-making frameworks limits the ability to objectively prioritize alternative green maritime strategies. This study addresses this gap by integrating Fuzzy AHP for criteria weighting and MOORA for alternative ranking, providing a quantitative and transparent evaluation model. The results show that COâ‚‚ emissions reduction (25.4 %) and energy efficiency (20.1 %) are the most critical factors, while economic considerations, such as implementation costs (8.5 %) and operational costs (7.2 %), were ranked lower. The MOORA ranking identifies energy-efficient vessel designs (score: 0.85) as the most effective strategy, followed by hydrogen and ammonia-based fuels (0.81). LNG and biofuels (0.72) serve as transitional solutions, while wind-assisted propulsion (0.69) and emission control technologies (0.62) exhibit operational limitations. A sensitivity analysis confirmed the rankings' robustness, reinforcing the decision model's stability. This study provides a data-driven foundation for policymakers and industry stakeholders, guiding the adoption of sustainable maritime strategies based on scientifically validated rankings.

TI  - Photovoltaic-based vertical wireless charging for sustainable marine electric systems
AB  - Maritime transportation relies heavily on the movement of fossil fuels, which contribute significantly to CO2 emissions and water pollution, raising serious environmental concerns. This research presents an innovative system combining solar PV technology and Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) for Marine Electric Vehicles (MEVs), which aims to revolutionize marine transportation. The proposed system uses solar energy collected by PV panels installed in the docking area, and then transfers the power to the MEV through a Resonance Inductive Power Transfer (RIPT) mechanism to charge the battery system. This approach overcomes the limitations of conventional wired charging systems, including wear and tear in harsh marine environments, as well as enhances safety by eliminating electrical connectors. ANSYS-MAXWELL simulations are used to evaluate the system performance and further, it is validated through experimental verification. The system achieves 92 % efficiency in a 1 kW Wireless Charging System (WCS), even under variable solar irradiance and Transmitter-Receiver coil misalignment conditions. The key innovation in this system includes the phase shift control technique for the driver-side transmission mechanism, ensuring efficient power transfer without communication channels. The combination of PV and WPT reduces grid dependency, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and supports multiple MEV configurations. Long-term benefits include reduced operating costs, longer equipment life, and increased safety due to reduced hazards such as electric shock and explosions. Future developments include closed-loop operation and IoT integration for real-time monitoring and speed control.

TI  - Optimization approach for sustainable decommissioning of unpiggable subsea pipelines: Insights from the Arabian Gulf
AB  - Unpiggable pipelines, often inaccessible for traditional pigging operations, pose significant risks due to residual hydrocarbons and limited inspection options. This paper presents an optimized methodology for flushing, deoiling, and abandoning unpiggable subsea pipelines, specifically designed to address the unique environmental and regulatory challenges in the Arabian Gulf. The paper introduces an innovative approach that integrates advanced modeling tools - OLGA for internal flow assurance and CORMIX for pollutant dispersion analysis - to manage oil-in-water (OIW) concentrations effectively, ensuring compliance with the stringent 15ppm discharge limit. The proposed methodology not only mitigates residual contamination risks but also enhances operational efficiency and regulatory compliance through adaptive measures. By addressing plateauing contaminant removal rates and leveraging region-specific environmental data, the current study provides actionable guidance for sustainable decommissioning of subsea pipelines. The findings hold broad applicability for projects in environmentally sensitive marine ecosystems, hence, supporting global efforts toward environmentally responsible decommissioning practices.

TI  - Technical and economic feasibility analysis of a subsea shuttle tanker for CO2 transport to the troll field
AB  - The Subsea Shuttle Tanker (SST) was presented by the authors as an innovative and cost-effective solution in several research works. This new approach offers a viable alternative to subsea pipelines and shuttle tanker ships for transporting liquid CO2 from onshore facilities to marginal offshore reservoirs. A previous technicalâ€“economic feasibility study found that the SST is generally economically competitive to the subsea pipelines and shuttle tanker ships for distances below 180Â km and CO2 transport volumes of one million tons per annum (mtpa). The economic cost models are based on those developed in Maritime UN-manned Navigation through Intelligence in Network (MUNIN) D 9.3 and the Zero Emission Platform (ZEP) projects. This paper will take this previous study further by focusing on performing the technical and economic feasibility analysis for operation in the Troll field on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS), which has a transport distance of 65Â km and a CO2 volume of 1.5 mtpa. Two SST design solutions are investigated by downscaling and upscaling the reference baseline design to evaluate SSTâ€™s technical feasibility. Using the abovementioned cost models, the CO2 transportation cost per ton using SST is compared with subsea pipelines and tanker ships. The numerical results show that it is economically feasible to manufacture SST with cargo capacities of 4453 m3 and 2203 m3. Furthermore, the results show that the SST is the most cost-effective option for transporting low-volume CO2 (1.5 mtpa) over short distances. Â© The Author(s) 2025.

TI  - Sustainability for ship operations in seaport areas: Technical solutions and environmental assessment
AB  - The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) has prohibited ships using of HFO in ports. For this reason, during in port operations, different strategies must be adopted, based on the use of cleaner fuels or on the transition towards marine electrical technologies. In this context, the purpose of the present research is to analyze and compare, from an environmental and economic points of view, different technical solutions for in port operations. Four alternative configurations have been proposed: Solution 1, Battery & Internal Combustion Engine (ICE); Solution 2, Battery & Fuel Cell (FC) with yellow hydrogen; Solution 3, Battery & Fuel Cell (FC) with green hydrogen, and Solution 4, Battery & Cold Ironing (CI). From the environmental perspective, the Well-to-Waves (WTW) analysis has been carried out; from the economic point of view, the investment costs and the operating costs have been calculated and compared. Moreover, an economic performance indicator, the Economic-Environmental Correlation specific Index (ECI), has been introduced and evaluated. Results highlighted that from environmental point of view, the best solution is achieved implementing the Battery & Fuel Cell (FC) solution. On the other hand, the Battery & Cold Ironing (CI) solution represents the best solution from the economic point of view, allowing to obtain the lowest ECI. Â© 2025 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Building materials could store more than 16 billion tonnes of CO2 annually
AB  - Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions likely entails not only lowering emissions but also deploying carbon dioxide (CO2) removal technologies. We explored the annual potential to store CO2 in building materials. We found that fully replacing conventional building materials with CO2-storing alternatives in new infrastructure could store as much as 16.6 Â± 2.8 billion tonnes of CO2 each year-roughly 50% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions in 2021. The total storage potential is far more sensitive to the scale of materials used than the quantity of carbon stored per unit mass of materials. Moreover, the carbon storage reservoir of building materials will grow in proportion to demand for such materials, which could reduce demand for more costly or environmentally risky geological, terrestrial, or ocean storage.

TI  - Groundwater releases CO2 to diverse global coastal ecosystems
AB  - Coastal ecosystems play a major role in marine carbon budgets, but substantial uncertainties remain in the sources and fluxes of coastal carbon dioxide (CO2). Here, we assess when, where, and how submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) releases CO2 to shallow coastal ecosystems. Time-series observations of dissolved CO2 and radon (222Rn, a natural groundwater tracer) across 40 coastal systems from 14 countries revealed large SGD-derived CO2 fluxes. The mean groundwater partial pressure of CO2 was 35 times higher than surface seawater. The mean SGD-derived CO2 flux was 148 Â± 226 millimoles per square meter per day (mmol mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1), resulting in a mean water-air CO2 flux of 80 Â± 133 mmol mâˆ’2 dayâˆ’1. Tidal rather than diel cycles drove CO2 enrichment in most ecosystems. Tidally driven SGD was the primary CO2 source in mangroves, salt marshes, tidal flats, estuaries, and canals. Overall, we expand current knowledge of marine carbon cycles by demonstrating SGD as an important source of CO2 that requires inclusion in coastal carbon budgets.

TI  - Evaluation of Energy Options for Island Communities: A Case Study on Ushant
AB  - The island of Ushant, like many island communities, faces major energy challenges, exacerbated by climate change and dependence on fossil fuels. In this context, the design of sustainable energy solutions, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring reliable access to energy and maritime transport is essential. To achieve these goals, a sizing simulation tool based on Matlab Simulink has been developed. This tool integrates several renewable energy sources, including wind, tidal turbines and photovoltaic systems, as well as hydrogen production and storage. The aim of this work is to model and evaluate different energy scenarios for the island, taking into account its specific energy demand and the needs of its maritime mobility. Taking into account both local grid and maritime mobility energy needs is one of the originality of this work. Four scenarios have been formulated. The first and second aim to achieve total energy autonomy for the island and its maritime mobility, using a hybrid hydrogen vessel for the first and a battery powered electric vessel for the second. The third scenario ensures the complete coverage of the islandâ€™s electrical load, whereas the fourth scenario covers only 70%, maintaining dependence on fossil fuels for the remaining 30% and also for maritime mobility. In order to find the best trade-off between cost and environmental impact in finding a sustainable and economically viable energy solution, a cost (CAPEX) comparison is also proposed.

TI  - The Ocean Energy Potential in the Area of Early-Retirement Asset Coal-Fired Power Plants Owned by PT PLN (Persero)
AB  - During the period from 1850 to 2020, global temperatures have increased by 1.1 C. Indonesia state owned electricity company (PLN) as environmental commitment has developed a corporate strategy to retire fossil fuel power plants (Coal Fire Power Plant & Diesel Power Plant), call-off the CFPP construction plan and increase the use of renewable energy. Supporting the target of Net Zero Emission (NZE) 2060, PLN will stop the operation of CFPP up to 6.7 Gigawatts (GW), with details of 3.2 GW stopping naturally and 3.5 GW with an early retirement scheme. For this reason, PLN has prepared a roadmap for early retirement of CFPP. The retirement of CFPP throughout Indonesia will be carried out in six stages until 2056. This strategy will make the mix of coal use remain at 13% and renewable energy increase up to 52% by 2040. The Indonesia's coast has the potential for electricity production of 62 GW originating from several mechanisms. One of the new renewable energies that has potential in Indonesia is ocean currents, ocean waves and tidal energy. If ocean water energy management technology can be developed immediately and affordable, then the CFPP assets that have been stalled can possibly be used to support the development of the ocean energy power plant. One of the CFPP that will be terminated soon is located in Cilacap, Central Java. This coastal city is facing toward Indian Ocean, which have huge potential ocean energy. The Southern Sea of Java Island has the potential for ocean energy such as tidal energy of 373867.2 kW, ocean waves on the south coast of 1, 207 kW and ocean currents of 0.747 kW.

TI  - Biofuel Production from Seaweed: A Sustainable Energy Solution
AB  - The global demand for sustainable energy sources has increased the amount of research being done on alternative methods of producing biofuel. Seaweed biofuel production is a viable source of sustainable energy with many social, economic, and environmental advantages. Seaweed biofuel has the potential to lessen greenhouse gas emissions, lessen dependency on finite fossil fuels, and promote economic growth in coastal areas by using the enormous resources offered by marine ecosystems. Seaweed-derived biofuels have various environmental benefits, including the capacity to absorb carbon, reduce land usage, and be carbon-neutral. To reach its full potential, though, a number of obstacles must be overcome, including improving growing techniques, creating effective conversion technologies, and integrating seaweed biofuel into the current energy system. Technological developments, regulatory support, and interdisciplinary research collaborations may enable seaweed biofuels to reach their full potential. This chapter provides a complete overview of the present studyâ€™s findings about the challenges, prospects, and state of seaweed-based biofuel production. To guarantee that the production of seaweed biofuel remains a feasible and sustainable energy source in the long run, attention must be paid to resource efficiency, ecological resilience, and sustainable agricultural practices.

TI  - Design and optimization of hybrid seawater reverse osmosisâ€“solar-driven desalinationâ€“pressure retarded osmosis system for energy efficient desalination maximizing economic potential
AB  - Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO)â€“pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) hybrid desalination system is being actively researched to reduce energy consumption by generating energy in the PRO. However, the SWROâ€“PRO hybrid system still faces the following challenges: low freshwater recovery and low energy generation. To resolve these challenges, this study first proposes a novel SWROâ€“Solar-driven desalination (SD)â€“PRO hybrid system for energy-efficient desalination. The proposed system comprises three major processes: SWRO for freshwater recovery, SD for freshwater recovery, and PRO for energy generation. First, the pressurized seawater passes through a semi-permeable SWRO membrane to produce freshwater, and the remaining concentrated brine enters the SD system. Second, an evaporator, that absorbs solar energy and quickly evaporates water floats on the SD system to recover additional freshwater. Third, the highly concentrated brine that remains unevaporated is used as a draw solution in PRO to generate energy. Consequently, the total freshwater recovery is increased by 14.54%, the specific energy consumption is reduced by 38.86%, and the levelized cost of the freshwater is reduced by 16.67% compared with the conventional SWROâ€“PRO system. Furthermore, the life cycle assessment results demonstrate that the proposed system is environmentally friendly. These results indicate that the proposed system is a feasible solution for sustainable desalination. Â© 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To reduce the loss of integrated electricity-gas energy system (IEGS) under typhoon disasters, a load restoration strategy for IEGS considering mobile hydrogen energy storage is proposed. Firstly, the load restoration potential of mobile hydrogen energy storage such as hydrogen powered buses and hydrogen powered ships on the IEGS is analyzed. Combining the spatio-temporal and energy characteristics, the emergency power supply models for hydrogen powered buses and hydrogen powered ships are constructed. Secondly, the coupling characteristics between the power distribution network and natural gas network are analyzed. A cooperative restoration model of IEGS considering the mobile hydrogen storage is established with the objective of minimizing system operation costs. The enhanced second-order-cone relaxation method is used to deal with the operation constraints of the natural gas network. Finally, taking a certain area in Foshan City, Guangdong Province of China, which is vulnerable to typhoons and developed in hydrogen energy along the coast of China, as the case background, the simulation is verified on IEEE 33-bus power distribution network and 7-bus natural gas network, as well as IEEE 123-bus power distribution network and 20-bus natural gas network. The results show that introducing the mobile hydrogen energy storage to participate in the post-disaster emergency power supply can effectively reduce the load loss and total costs, thereby enhancing the resilience of IEGS under typhoon disasters.

TI  - Influence of EP/SiC Composite Coating on Surface Charge Distribution and Flashover Characteristics of Insulator
AB  - The construction of a new type of power system with new energy as the main body has become an inevitable choice to realize the national â€œdouble carbonâ€ strategic goal, and HVDC transmission technology is an important physical support for the realization of new energy grid connection and the safe and stable operation of large power grids. The gas insulated transmission line (GIL) can meet the special transmission needs of offshore wind power transmission and offshore island power supply, crossing rivers and lakes and urban power corridors, and is the key equipment for the future DC power grid. Compared with AC pipeline equipment, the surface charge accumulation problem of basin insulator under DC stress is more serious.This research investigates the impact of SiC coatings with varying thickness and composition on the prevention of surface charge buildup and enhancement of DC flashover voltage. The nano-silicon carbide (SiC) and epoxy resin (EP) were uniformly mixed to obtain a coating, which was uniformly coated on the insulator sample to obtain a coated insulator sample. The potential values of each point on the surface were measured, and the surface charge distribution was obtained by inversion algorithm. The experiments conducted demonstrate that the coating effectively optimize the surface charge situation and electric field distribution, while simultaneously increasing the breakdown voltage. Increased mass fraction of doped filler particles, the surface charge density achieves its minimum value when the SiC concentration is 20wt %. As the coating increases from 100Â um to 300Â um and then to 500Â um, the charge does not decrease monotonically, but a minimum value appears in the 300Â um sample test. And the experimental results show that any coating with any parameter can improve the DC flashover voltage of insulator samples to varying degrees. The research in this paper can provide theoretical basis and technical support for the optimal design of surface insulation of DC GIL basin insulator. Â© Beijing Paike Culture Commu. Co., Ltd. 2025.

TI  - Multi-agent decision-making game for international maritime bypass under unilateral carbon policy
AB  - With the maritime industry's integration into the carbon emissions trading system, decarbonizing international maritime transport is imminent. This study examines potential ship bypass phenomena under unilateral carbon policies by establishing a stochastic evolutionary game model involving a cross-border maritime enterprise, a carbon policy country, and a bypassing country. We then perform a parameter sensitivity analysis based on the game's stability conditions. Key findings are outlined below: (1) In the current situation, the unilateral carbon policy will inevitably result in the phenomenon of bypassing of ships. (2) The implementation of synergistic strategies by bypassing countries elevates the variability in cross-border maritime enterprises' strategic decisions. Specifically, these strategies mitigate the occurrence of bypassing to a certain degree, indicating a potential reduction in its frequency. (3) Bypass countries exhibit a heightened sensitivity toward the degree of synergy in carbon policies and the potential collaborative gains resulting from the improved international standing arising from such synergy. This suggests a greater interest in the long-term advantages conferred by harmonized carbon policies. (4) As stochastic perturbations intensify, bypassing countries exhibit the highest level of volatility, potentially deviating from their original synergistic strategy and adopting a non-synergistic carbon policy. This suggests that their strategic decisions are particularly unstable in response to external disturbances. (5) With an increase in random perturbation intensity, compared with the carbon tax policy, the carbon trading policy exhibits stronger stability, indicating that the implementation of the latter policy is more conducive to cross-regional carbon policy synergy.

TI  - Multi-Criteria Analysis for Integrating Renewable Energy Solutions in the Restoration of Surface Waters-Selected Lakes Case Study
AB  - The protection and reclamation of surface waters, particularly lakes, necessitates the implementation of novel approaches that effectively integrate natural biological processes with sophisticated technological solutions. This paper examines the potential of bioremediation techniques utilising artificial aeration systems, with renewable energy sources serving as a viable power source. The objective of the analysis is to enhance the sustainability of the remediation of aquatic ecosystems. A multi-criteria analysis (MCA) was employed to evaluate the performance and environmental impact of the selected methods. Based on the results of the MCA, the SHPP (small hydro power plant) technology achieved the highest score for both lakes, 0.85 and 0.78, respectively, making it the optimal technology. In comparison, wind energy scored around 0.5 and photovoltaic (PV) around 0.6, showing a poorer fit with local conditions. By integrating reclamation with renewable energy applications, this research presents a strategy for developing more resilient and environmentally sound water management strategies.

TI  - Harnessing the Low-Hanging Fruits: Rewetting Unmanaged Marginal Organic Soils to Achieve Maximal Greenhouse Gas Reduction
AB  - Rewetting drained peatlands is a promising strategy for mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, transforming these areas from carbon sources to sinks. Despite the well-known climate benefits, practical implementation is often hampered by conflicts between environmental goals and farmers' economic interests. Identifying optimal rewetting locations that maximize greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction while minimizing agricultural disruption is crucial to advancing this process. However, there is currently limited scientific evidence to guide these decisions. To identify ``low-hanging fruits{''}, 12 sites were selected for 4-month incubations to investigate the effects of four land uses (grass-cut, grass-graze, arable, and unmanaged) on CO2 and methane (CH4) emissions postrewetting. Results showed that unmanaged sites exhibited the highest potential for GHG reduction (2015 mg CO2-eq m-2 day-1, 89.9\%), followed by grass-graze, grass-cut, and arable sites, reflecting a gradient of management intensity. These insights suggest that prioritizing rewetting of unmanaged areas while delaying interventions on arable lands could yield greater climate benefits and enhance farmers' acceptance. Additionally, emission variability across sites was linked to soil properties, indicating that soils with a higher organic carbon content (for greater CO2 reduction) and lower bacterial diversity (for reduced CH4 production) offer the greatest GHG reduction potential. This study provides crucial scientific evidence to guide targeted peatland rewetting efforts, supporting net-zero emission goals.

TI  - Resilience solution to solve prisoner's dilemma in port shore power usage: The value of government subsidies on port
AB  - As environmental pollution increases and pollutants emitted by ships pose a threat to the environment and health, port shore power has become an effective means of reducing pollution from ships. However, shipping companies are affected by fuel prices and may ignore environmental issues and jeopardize social welfare in pursuit of their own interests. Therefore, government intervention is particularly important, especially through subsidies to solve the conflict between competition among shipping companies and environmental pollution. This study develops a three-tier supply chain model incorporating governmental authorities, port operators, and dual shipping companies to examine shore power adoption strategies. Through Nash equilibrium analysis, we investigate the efficiency of shore power utilization under both subsidized and non-subsidized scenarios in order to find the resilience solution for the relevant stakeholders. The findings reveal that in the absence of government intervention, shipping companies' equilibrium strategies are primarily determined by the relative costs of conventional fuel and shore power, leading to potential Prisoner's Dilemma situations. The introduction of government subsidies enhances the likelihood of achieving stable equilibrium for both shipping companies while mitigating the Prisoner's Dilemma effect. The study provides references of resilience solution for related fields and policy recommendations for parties in the port and shipping supply chain.

TI  - Enhancing Port Energy Autonomy Through Hybrid Renewables and Optimized Energy Storage Management
AB  - Hybrid renewable energy systems (HRESs) are being incorporated and evaluated within seaports to realize efficiencies, reduce dependence on grid electricity, and reduce operating costs. The paper adopts a genetic algorithm (GA)-based optimization framework to assess four energy management scenarios that embed wind turbines (WTs), photovoltaic energy (PV), an energy storage system (ESS), and an energy management system (EMS). The scenarios were developed based on different levels of renewable energy integration, energy storage utilization, and grid dependency to optimize cost and sustainability while reflecting the actual port energy scenario as the base case. Integrating HRES, ESS, and EMS reduced the port's levelized cost of energy (LCOE) by up to 54\%, with the most optimized system (Scenario 3) achieving a 53\% reduction while enhancing energy stability, minimizing grid reliance, and maximizing renewable energy utilization. The findings show that the HRES configuration provides better cost, sustainability, and resiliency than the conventional grid-tied system. The unique proposed EMS takes it a step further, optimizing not just the energy flow but also the cost, making the overall system more efficient-and less costly-for the user. ESS complements energy storage and keeps it functional and reliable while EMS makes it completely functional by devising ways to reduce costs and enhance efficiency. The study presents the technical and economic viability of HRES as an economic and operational smart port infrastructure through its cost-effective integration of renewable energy sources. The results reinforce the move from conventional to sustainable autonomous port energy systems and lay the groundwork for forthcoming studies of DR-enhanced port energy management schemes. While prior studies have explored renewable energy integration within ports, many lack a unified, empirically validated framework that considers HRES, ESS, and EMS within real-world port operations. This research addresses this gap by developing an optimization-driven approach that assesses the techno-economic feasibility of port energy systems while incorporating real-time data and advanced control strategies. This study was conducted to enhance port infrastructure and evaluate the impact of HRES, ESS, and EMS on port sustainability and autonomy. By bridging the gap between theoretical modeling and practical implementation, it offers a scalable and adaptable solution for improving cost efficiency and energy resilience in port operations.
