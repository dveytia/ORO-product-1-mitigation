TI  - Subsurface biogeochemical carbon recycling: CO2-EGR with microbial methanogenesis in geochemically sealed aquifers
AB  - It is estimated that almost ten trillion cubic meters of methane are contained in sedimentary basins in Japan and under the seafloor around the Japanese Islands. Most of the natural gas resources, however, are hardly economically recoverable as the methane is adsorbed in coal seams, trapped in hydrate clathrate or dissolved in saline groundwater. Shallow subsurface accumulation of methane poses even a hidden threat of explosive global warming. Enhanced gas recovery by subsurface CO2 injection (CO2-EGR) is a practicable solution for the greenhouse gas control and for efficient use of unmineable energy resources. Extremely light isotopic compositions of carbon in methane from many subsurface accumulations of natural gas suggest it was formed by methanogens. The subsurface lithoautotrophic microbes form methane again from disposed CO2 without sunlight in anoxic aquifers. Re-extraction of subsurface methane, that has been converted from disposed CO2 by methanogens, makes the carbon recycling complete. Autogenous sealing by formation of CO2-hydrate prevents the release of CO2 in aquifers under sea floor deeper than 300m. In warm inland and shallow subsurface aquifers, leakage of CO2 is prevented by carbon dioxide precipitation in a preset ``ambush aquifer{''} with high pH and high calcium ion concentration. If necessary, lime water is injected into the ``ambush aquifer{''} over the caprock of CO2-reservoirs. Safe long containment of CO2 and gas is important for methane fermentation in CO2-reservoirs. A subsurface ecosystem is similar to an archaic ecosystem that was adapted to anoxic CO2-rich atmosphere under high pressure and temperature. Methanogenesis is active even in deep basaltic aquifers. Subsurface biogeochemical carbon recycling may realize greenhouse gas control with restoration of energy resources.

TI  - Cost analysis of optimized islanded energy systems in a dispersed air base conflict
AB  - The United States Air Force has implemented a dispersed air base strategy to enhance mission effectiveness for near-peer conflicts. Asset dispersal places many smaller bases across a wide geographic area, which increases resupply requirements and logistical complexity. Hybrid energy systems reduce resupply requirements through sustainable, off-grid energy production. This paper presents a novel hybrid energy renewable delivery system (HERDS) model capable of (1) selecting the optimal hybrid energy system design that meets demand at the lowest net present cost and (2) optimizing the delivery of the selected system using existing Air Force cargo aircraft. The novelty of the model's capabilities is displayed using Clark Air Base, Philippines as a case study. The HERDS model selected an optimal configuration consisting of a 676-kW photovoltaic array, an 1846-kWh battery system, and a 200-kW generator. This hybrid energy system predicts a 54% reduction in cost and an 88% reduction in fuel usage, as compared to the baseline Air Force system. The HERDS model is expected to support planners in their ongoing efforts to construct cost-effective sites that minimize the transport and logistic requirements associated with remote installations. Additionally, the results of this paper may be appropriate for broader civilian applications. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - CONSEQUENCE MODELING OF HYPOTHETICAL RELEASES FROM CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2) TRANSPORT PIPELINES
AB  - Reducing carbon emissions is increasingly becoming a priority to combat climate change. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is one of the primary approaches to help combat carbon emissions in the oil and gas and other industries. These technologies involve capturing the CO2 from combustion, refining, or other types of industrial activities, then transporting that CO2 to another location where it can be utilized or stored underground or below the sea floor. Pipelines are one of the primary transportation methods, and as more CCUS operations start to come online, more pipelines will be built or converted from transporting hydrocarbons to transporting CO2. Like most products transported by pipeline, there are risks associated with CO2 transport. However, these risks are quite different from those of hydrocarbon transport. CO2 is not flammable and is less toxic. The primary risk associated with a release of a large quantity of CO2 is the displacement of oxygen that can cause an asphyxiation hazard. Direct exposure to cooled CO2 liquid or gas can cause irritation or even frostbite. CO2 releases into water can harmfully alter the water pH level. Due to these risks, it is necessary for operators to understand the potential consequences of an accidental loss of containment. This paper will review an approach for consequence modeling used for the potential conversion of service from crude oil transport to CO2, for a confidential pipeline operator. This will include an overview of the modeling tools used, the inputs and assumptions incorporated, the range of hypothetical release scenarios considered (including full-bore ruptures and smaller leaks) and overview of the results. This assessment was used to answer a variety of questions asked to evaluate whether this conversion was a viable project. This included determining the potential impact area from a worst-case discharge, what receptors are at risk, and identifying optimal operational considerations (i.e. valve type and placement, leak detection requirements, etc.). This approach for consequence modeling for CO2 pipelines can be used to help ensure safety during the coming energy transition. Copyright Â© 2022 by ASME.

TI  - THE INFLUENCE AT VERTICAL FIRST ORDER MOTIONS USING APPENDAGES IN A MONOCOLUMN PLATFORM
AB  - Oil discovery in ultra-deep-waters is carrying out the ocean engineering to develop new conceptions of offshore exploration and production systems. A promising alternative is a monocolumn platform with moonpool. Concept design has shown its good stability make feasible the use as offshore solution. In order to solve the problem brings by increase on water deep, the use of steel catenary risers and wellhead dry completion has been shown a good solution because it decreases the maintenance cost. However, this solution needs a very low vertical motion. In general, platform like the monocolumn present resonance on vertical motion (15-20 sec to heave motion, 20-25 sec to roll/pitch motion) close to typical wave energy. This fact is so that designers introduce mechanisms to leave the natural periods out of wave energy. The moonpool as passive absorber motion was a solution found by designers. The water inside moonpool acts out-of-phase with platform motion. This difference on phases can attenuate the platform dynamic response. Other solution is water-line-area (AWL) reduction that reduced the restoring forces and consequently increased the value of vertical motions natural periods. These two alternatives showed very efficient to improve the monocolumn performance. This paper presents the gain, in terms of motions, achieved as the appendages introduction on the platform. These appendages consist of two plates, one in form of a disk and other around it. It can be located on the bottom at platform and inserted inside at the moonpool. Model test conduced on the scaled platform shows that heave and pitch natural period increased approximately 4 seconds when this appendages is allocated on the bottom. Practically any change is noted when it is allocated only inside of the moonpool.

TI  - Touch the Sea: Energy Efficient Relay Design for Maritime Multi-Hop Multicast Systems
AB  - With growing human maritime activities, supporting low-cost and high-speed information services for users at sea has become an imperative focus. In this paper, we consider a maritime relay multicast system including a shore-based base station and several offshore relay nodes, and propose an energy efficient relay design scheme. Specifically, we formulate the relay design problem as a power minimization problem under users' qualityof-service (QoS) constraints, and the problem is approximated and solved using the feasible point pursuit successive convex approach. Furthermore, an iterative algorithm is proposed with exponential complexity. In order to reduce the computational complexity, a low-complexity distributed algorithm is conceived and its closed-form solution is derived. Finally, simulation results show that our proposed scheme is beneficial in terms of achieving a higher communication rate as well as of yielding a better energy efficiency.

TI  - Application of the climate action reserve's forest project protocol to a longleaf pine forest under restoration management
AB  - The Climate Action Reserve's Forest Project Protocol Version 3.2 is the current basis for the participation of US-based forest carbon projects in California's cap-and-trade system, yet is largely untested in forests beyond California, particularly those of the southeastern US Coastal Plain. Applying the Protocol to a hypothetical project on a longleaf pine site managed primarily for ecological restoration produced on-site gains of 0.3 mt CO2/ac/yr, but net emissions of 0.8 mt CO2/ac/yr over the project lifetime. These results are based on site-specific conditions (e.g., low stand density) and certain elements of the Protocol (e.g., heavy influence of off-site stocks), highlighting the potential conflict between managing for both climate benefits and ecological restoration on some lands. We recommend that forest owners conduct preliminary analyses to determine whether implementing a carbon project on their forestlands would likely produce their desired results. We further recommend modifications to the Protocol to improve its utility. Copyright Â© 2013 Society of American Foresters.

TI  - Model based optimal management of a hybrid propulsion system for leisure boats
AB  - The strict emission standards for port approach and coastal navigation, and the fuel-saving requirements, in the marine sector, are pushing the manufactures to consider more advanced and alternative propulsion systems. In this context, this study deals with the design and management of an innovative hybrid thermal-electric propulsion system. The evaluations are referred to the case study of a leisure boat, which is used for passenger transportation in tourist areas. Experimental tests are carried out on single components, with a particular focus on re-calibration of the thermal engine, for its homologation and optimal use in the proposed hybrid architecture. The identification of proper management strategies is performed on the basis of a boat simulation model, which is set up starting from experimental data and characteristics of components. In this regard, an optimization procedure, based on the use of genetic algorithms, is performed in order to set the parameters of onboard energy management strategies and pursue the double objective of extending battery pack cycling life and reducing exhaust emissions. The obtained simulation results highlight the benefits of the proposed architecture showing sensible improvements in comparison with a traditional ICE based configuration. The methodology proposed in this paper enables reliable evaluations and preliminary optimization of energy management strategies, with a drastic reduction in experimentation time and general costs.

TI  - A Novel Mooring Tether for Highly-Dynamic Offshore Applications; Mitigating Peak and Fatigue Loads via Selectable Axial Stiffness
AB  - Highly-dynamic floating bodies such as wave energy convertors require mooring lines with particular mechanical properties; the mooring system must achieve adequate station keeping whilst controlling mooring tensions within acceptable limits. Optimised compliant mooring systems can meet these requirements but where compliance is achieved through system architecture, the complexity of the system increases together with the mooring footprint. This work introduces the ``Exeter Tether{''}, a novel fibre rope mooring tether providing advantages over conventional fibre ropes. The tether concept aims to provide a significantly lower axial stiffness by de-coupling this attribute from the minimum breaking load of the line. A benefit of reduced axial stiffness is the reduction of mooring system stiffness providing a reduction of peak and fatigue loads, without increasing mooring system complexity. Reducing these loads improves system reliability and allows a reduction in mass of both the mooring system and the floating body, thus reducing costs. The principles behind the novel tether design are presented here, along with an outline of eight prototype tether variants. Results from the proof of concept study are given together with preliminary findings from sea trials conducted in Falmouth Bay. Results demonstrate that the Exeter Tether can be configured to achieve a significantly lower axial stiffness than conventional fibre rope and that the stiffness is selectable within limits for a given breaking strength. Strain values greater than 0.35 are achieved at 30\% of line breaking strength; this represents more than a threefold increase of the strain achievable with a conventional rope of the same material. The tether was subjected to six months of sea trials to establish any threats to its own reliability and to inform future design enhancements in this respect.

TI  - Blue carbon in coastal landscapes: a spatial framework for assessment of stocks and additionality
AB  - Efforts to incorporate blue carbon, the carbon associated with marine ecosystems, into carbon accounting and carbon markets are increasing. To fully leverage the capacity of marine ecosystems to sequester carbon requires information to guide prioritisation of coastal landscapes for conservation and regeneration. A comprehensive landscape-scale assessment of mangrove and saltmarsh blue carbon requires information regarding vegetation cover, sedimentological and geomorphological factors. This information should also be integrated with socio-economic factors that alter natural processes of blue carbon accumulation and storage. The purpose of this study was to provide a framework for undertaking a first-pass assessment of blue carbon storage, preservation, generation and permanency in coastal landscapes, and to incorporate socio-economic factors that will influence blue carbon storage in coastal landscapes. This was achieved using readily available datasets that were analysed using a raster-based approach to develop a proxy indication of biophysical and socio-economic factors relevant for mangrove and saltmarsh blue carbon. The approach demonstrated that large catchments were associated with areas highly suitable for blue carbon storage, preservation, generation and permanency. Small catchments associated with mature barrier estuaries had the highest proportional area that provides potential blue carbon ecosystem services and climate mitigation benefits. The qualitative approach used does not replace high-resolution quantitative assessments of blue carbon storage, flux and detailed site-specific assessment of socio-economic factors that may influence blue carbon services; however, it can be used to guide prioritisation of blue carbon landscapes for further assessment prior to conservation and/or regeneration.

TI  - Risk assessment in offshore salt caverns to store CO2
AB  - Although factual experience of developing offshore salt cavern to CO2 disposal in ultra-deep water is unprecedent, the theme has been gaining relevant attention in Brazil, fueled by the challenges imposed by oil production on the Pre-Salt reservoirs. It is true that some authors have conducted researches related to CO2 disposal on onshore salt caverns, but most of the works regarding salt cavern are related to onshore constructions that are used as methane store to supplement gas consumption during the peak energy demands that historically occurs during the winter season in the North hemisphere. This paper aims to contribute for CO2 disposal research, describing the results obtained from the application of a Preliminary Risk Analysis (PRA) during the conceptual engineering phase of an offshore salt cavern to store CO2 in Brazilian Pre-Salt.

TI  - Field experiment on sand bypass off the Iioka coast
AB  - The dumping of sand at offshore locations downdrift of structures blocking longshore sand transport is a promising method of sand bypass. To investigate the applicability of the method, bathymetric surveys were carried out to measure changes in sea bottom topography for approximately 5000 m3 of dumped sand and the movement of fluorescent sand was traced. The results showed that the sand moved onshore and accumulated behind the detached breakwaters located on the downdrift side of the injection point. The study suggests the possibility of utilizing natural wave energy as an alternative to artificial sand transport.

TI  - Designing bamboo wave attenuators for mangrove plantations
AB  - The design of a cost-effective method for attenuating wave energy to protect coastal mangrove plantations is examined. The design makes use of bamboo, a material that is strong, environment-friendly, and widely available and cheap in most developing countries. It is suggested that bamboo poles are pushed into the sediment offshore from the coastal mangrove plantation, presumably unconsolidated mud. In order to determine the performance in reducing incident wave energy, a numerical model was developed that is capable of predicting wave attenuation due to isolated cylinders of various spatial densities, i.e. number of bamboo per m(2), and various diameters. A design in which an 8 cm bamboo diameter arranged within a density of 1 bamboo per m(2) to 4 bamboos/m(2) is shown to be the most economical way of attenuating 50\% of incident wave energy, costing as low as US\$ 22.5 per 1m length of coastal protection. This is significantly lower than conventional breakwaters, which cost over US\$ 1,000/m. A field experiment on a mud-bank and review of various studies suggested that the bamboo embedment depth be no less than 60 cm to avoid dislodging and scouring, with 100 cm of bamboo protruding above the bed surface.

TI  - A miniaturized bionic ocean-battery mimicking the structure of marine microbial ecosystems
AB  - Marine microbial ecosystems can be viewed as a huge ocean-battery charged by solar energy. It provides a model for fabricating bio-solar cell, a bioelectrochemical system that converts light into electricity. Here, we fabricate a bio-solar cell consisting of a four-species microbial community by mimicking the ecological structure of marine microbial ecosystems. We demonstrate such ecological structure consisting of primary producer, primary degrader, and ultimate consumers is essential for achieving high power density and stability. Furthermore, the four-species microbial community is assembled into a spatial-temporally compacted cell using conductive hydrogel as a sediment-like anaerobic matrix, forming a miniaturized bionic ocean-battery. This battery directly converts light into electricity with a maximum power of 380 mu W and stably operates for over one month. Reproducing the photoelectric conversion function of marine microbial ecosystems in this bionic battery overcomes the sluggish and network-like electron transfer, showing the biotechnological potential of synthetic microbial ecology. Marine ecosystems are dominated by microbial communities. Inspired by the photoelectric conversion feature of the marine ecosystems, the authors design a four-species microbial community to mimic primary producer, primary degrader, and ultimate consumers, and show its ability to convert light into electricity for over one month.

The government plans to ensure that it makes the most of the substantial remaining reserves in the North Sea in addition to having a diverse range of sources for imports. The white paper's central case projection to 2020 shows that the increase in generation from renewables will more than offset the reduction in nuclear. The white paper proposes that emissions are cut by between 23-33 million tonnes of carbon by 2020. A clear commitment to development of skills and resources within the energy sector is also vital if the industry is to deliver the new build and retro-fit projects necessary utilizing UK resources.

AB  - This paper theoretically investigates the effects of the temperature and flowrate of cold seawater on the net output of an OTEC plant. Parameters of pipe length, pipe diameter, seawater depth, and the flowrate of seawater are considered. It shows that a maximum output of the net work exists at a certain flowrate of cooling seawater. The output work is higher for a larger ratio of warm to cold seawater flow rate. For a lower cold seawater temperature, the maximum net output and the corresponding required flow rate of cold seawater becomes larger. The pipe diameters corresponding to maximum net output increase with decreasing cold seawater temperature for fixed flow velocity in pipes. In addition, a larger maximum net output can be obtained by employing a higher temperature of the surface warm seawater. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Waste biomass integration to reduce fuel consumption and levelized cost of electricity in Philippine off-grid islands
AB  - A techno-economic assessment was made for thirteen large off-grid islands in the Philippines using HOMER Pro (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables Software) to determine the feasibility of integrating waste biomass into their energy systems. Sensitivity analysis on the diesel fuel prices and biomass feedstock prices was performed to determine their effects on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and the renewable energy (RE) share. The results suggest that an average LCOE reduction of around 4.57 %, fuel reduction of 5.71 %, and RE share increase of 4.99 % can be realized by integrating biomass to the existing diesel system even without incorporation of other renewable energy generators such as solar photovoltaics. In cases where biomass is available in large quantities, and the energy demand is relatively low, LCOE reduction, fuel reduction, and RE share increase may even reach up to more than 20 %. This makes the integrated biomass-diesel hybrid system a viable option for reducing diesel consumption in the off-grid islands. And even with the establishment of a feedstock market, the biomass-diesel hybrid system still has a lower LCOE compared to the existing diesel-only systems. This work provides the first systematic techno-economic study on the potential of incorporating waste biomass in off-grid islands. Copyright Â© 2019, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

TI  - Potential interactions between diadromous fishes of U.K. conservation importance and the electromagnetic fields and subsea noise from marine renewable energy developments
AB  - The considerable extent of construction and operation of marine renewable energy developments (MRED) within U.K. and adjacent waters will lead, among other things, to the emission of electromagnetic fields (EMF) and subsea sounds into the marine environment. Migratory fishes that respond to natural environmental cues, such as the Earth's geomagnetic field or underwater sounds, move through the same waters that the MRED occupy, thereby raising the question of whether there are any effects of MRED on migratory fishes. Diadromous species, such as the Salmonidae and Anguillidae, which undertake large-scale migrations through coastal and offshore waters, are already significantly affected by other human activities leading to national and international conservation efforts to manage any existing threats and to minimize future concerns, including the potential effect of MRED. Here, the current state of knowledge with regard to the potential for diadromous fishes of U.K. conservation importance to be affected by MRED is reviewed. The information on which to base the review was found to be limited with respect to all aspects of these fishes' migratory behaviour and activity, especially with regards to MRED deployment, making it difficult to establish cause and effect relationships. The main findings, however, were that diadromous species can use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and direction finding during migrations. Juveniles of anadromous brown trout (sea trout) Salmo trutta and close relatives of S. trutta respond to both the Earth's magnetic field and artificial magnetic fields. Current knowledge suggests that EMFs from subsea cables may interact with migrating Anguilla sp. (and possibly other diadromous fishes) if their movement routes take them over the cables, particularly in shallow water (<20 m). The only known effect is a temporary change in swimming direction. Whether this will represent a biologically significant effect, for example delayed migration, cannot yet be determined. Diadromous fishes are likely to encounter EMFs from subsea cables either during the adult movement phases of life or their early life stages during migration within shallow, coastal waters adjacent to natal rivers. The underwater sound from MRED devices has not been fully characterized to determine its acoustic properties and propagation through the coastal waters. MRED that require pile driving during construction appear to be the most relevant to consider. In the absence of a clear understanding of their response to underwater sound, the specific effects on migratory species of conservation concern remain very difficult to determine in relation to MRED. Based on the studies reviewed, it is suggested that fishes that receive high intensity sound in close proximity to construction may be physiologically affected to some degree, whereas those at farther distances, potentially up to several km, may exhibit behaviour responses; the effect of which is unknown and will be dependent on the properties of the received sound and receptor characteristics and condition. Whether there are behavioural effects on the fishes during operation is unknown but any change to the environment and subsequent response by the fishes would need to be considered over the lifetime of the MRED. It is not yet possible to determine if effects relating to sound exposure are biologically significant. The current assumptions of limited effects are built on an incomplete understanding of how the species move around their environment and interact with natural and anthropogenic EMFs and subsea sound. A number of important knowledge gaps exist, principally whether migratory fish species on the whole respond to the EMF and the sound associated with MRED. Future research should address the principal gaps before assuming that any effect on diadromous species results in a biological effect.

TI  - Research studies of the fire performance of composite materials at the University of Manchester
AB  - Owing to their lightweight and good corrosion resistance, Glass fibre Reinforced Plastic (GRP) composites are increasingly being used as an alternative offshore construction material to steel and concrete. However, their applications in the building industry are limited due to their perceived weakness under fire conditions and a lack of design information. The fire performance of GRP composites is being studied in a number of places world-wide and this paper reviews some of the research studies carried out by the Structures and Fire Research Group at the University of Manchester, UK. This research has so far been only concerned with the experimental and numerical study of the thermal properties of a variety of composite materials and the thermal performance of different offshore composite systems including panels and pipes. This paper describes the completed experimental programme and their results and discusses the numerical heat transfer modelling technique and the selection of appropriate thermal properties of GRP composites for numerical modelling.

TI  - Produced water analysis by X-ray fluorescence with and without the presence of crude oil
AB  - Scaling and corrosion are two common problems during oil and gas production which can cause severe safety issues and significant decrease in production. Analysis of produced water is widely applied to evaluate scaling and corrosion by monitoring parameters such as pH, alkalinity, cation concentrations, sulfate concentration, total dissolved solids (TDS) and conductivity/resistivity. Produced water sampling is usually performed at the wellhead for on-shore wells and can be done relatively easily if unpressurized samples are required. However, temperature and pressure drop as well as CO2 degassing during sampling dramatically affect pH and alkalinity measurements. As a result, carbonate scales may precipitate during degassing. For offshore wells, produced water sampling on site is costly and time consuming and mainly performed after abnormal observation of production rate. Thus, scale monitoring and prediction based on analysis of surface produced water is not reliable and analysis under temperature and pressure is required for accurate results. In this paper, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is used for monitoring water composition for scale and corrosion prediction with or without the presence of crude oil. To our best knowledge, XRF has not been reported as an analytical approach for water analysis with the presence of crude oil. This technique measures various metal cation concentration quantitatively in oil and water emulsions. It allows for a fast analysis of the water composition without the need for oil and water separation. Combined with automatic water analysis device developed previously, all important water parameters including, but not limited to, pH, alkalinity, sulfate, total hardness, TDS and cation concentrations can be measured for scale and corrosion monitoring and prediction. Measured results will be transfered and automatically incorporated into scale prediction software for scaling risk evaluation and scale inhibitor selection. In addition, concentration of other metal ions (Na, Mg, Fe, Mo, Ni, Co, Mn, etc.), heavy metal ions (Pb, Zr, Hg, Cd, etc.) and nonmetal elements (S, P, As, etc.) can also be measured. Concentration of Fe, Mo, Ni, Co and Mn has been accurately measured. In situ measurement of transition metal concentrations can be a useful tool for monitoring potential corrosion during production. The technology developed in this paper allows for automatic online monitoring of scale and corrosion risks under real production conditions. This system accurately measures various parameters and provides valuable produced water information without user interferences and with little maintenance. Â© 2017, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Ocean acidification over the next three centuries using a simple global climate carbon-cycle model: projections and sensitivities
AB  - Continued oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is projected to significantly alter the chemistry of the upper oceans over the next three centuries, with potentially serious consequences for marine ecosystems. Relatively few models have the capability to make projections of ocean acidification, limiting our ability to assess the impacts and probabilities of ocean changes. In this study we examine the ability of Hector v1.1, a reduced-form global model, to project changes in the upper ocean carbonate system over the next three centuries, and quantify the model's sensitivity to parametric inputs. Hector is run under prescribed emission pathways from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and compared to both observations and a suite of Coupled Model Intercomparison (CMIP5) model outputs. Current observations confirm that ocean acidification is already taking place, and CMIP5 models project significant changes occurring to 2300. Hector is consistent with the observational record within both the high-(> 55 degrees) and low-latitude oceans (< 55 degrees). The model projects low-latitude surface ocean pH to decrease from preindustrial levels of 8.17 to 7.77 in 2100, and to 7.50 in 2300; aragonite saturation levels (Omega(Ar)) decrease from 4.1 units to 2.2 in 2100 and 1.4 in 2300 under RCP 8.5. These magnitudes and trends of ocean acidification within Hector are largely consistent with the CMIP5 model outputs, although we identify some small biases within Hector's carbonate system. Of the parameters tested, changes in {[}H+] are most sensitive to parameters that directly affect atmospheric CO2 concentrations -Q(10) (terrestrial respiration temperature response) as well as changes in ocean circulation, while changes in Omega(Ar) saturation levels are sensitive to changes in ocean salinity and Q(10). We conclude that Hector is a robust tool well suited for rapid ocean acidification projections and sensitivity analyses, and it is capable of emulating both current observations and large-scale climate models under multiple emission pathways.

TI  - A feasibility study of producing natural gas from subsea hydrates with horizontal snake wells
AB  - This study focuses on technical feasibility of producing natural gas from offshore gas hydrate deposits using a new technique called horizontal snake wells (HSW). This paper addresses engineering and well productivity issues for the new technique. Coiled tubing string is proposed to drill HSW in gas hydrate reservoirs for increasing well productivity and reducing wellbore collapse problems. A new analytical model was derived to predict of maximum achievable wellbore length (MAWL) based on the theory of buckling failure. Furui's equation for gas reservoirs was used for predicting the initial well productivity at the MAWL. Gas lift method is proposed to remove water for achieving a constant bottom hole pressure that is slightly below the hydrate dissociation pressure. Gas production forecast was made on the basis of material balance. Net present value (NPV) method is employed to perform economics analysis. A gas hydrate reservoir in the South China Sea was taken as an example to investigate the feasibility of producing natural gas from gas hydrate deposits using the HSW technique. The new analytical model gave the MAWL under extreme well friction conditions prior to buckling failure of coiled tubing. Furui's equation predicted commercial well productivity at the MAWL, depending on the loop separation of the HSW. If the bottom pressure is maintained with gas lift technique at a constant level slightly lower than the hydrate dissociation pressure to prevent wellbore collapse, material balance forecasted high NPV of HSW. It is concluded that the HSW is a feasible technique for economically producing natural gas from offshore gas hydrate deposits. This paper presents a novel method called HSW for producing natural gas from offshore gas hydrate deposits. It also demonstrates how to evaluate the productivity and thus economics of the HSW.

TI  - Influence of Low-Speed Marine Diesel Engine Settings on Waste Heat Availability
AB  - The low-speed marine diesel engine is the most effective of all the ship propulsion systems. On every ship there is a need for thermal energy besides mechanical power to drive the propeller. It is possible to install a heat exchanger in the exhaust system that makes use of waste heat of the exhaust gasses of the diesel engine. Such a combined mechanical and thermal energy generation is called cogeneration. Modern engines allow the variation of the fuel injection timing and the variation of the exhaust valve timing, which results in a great usage flexibility. In the current work a computer simulation model of a low-speed marine diesel engine is presented. The exhaust gas heat energy available to power a heat exchanger was calculated. The time of the beginning of fuel injection and the time of the opening of the exhaust valve was varied. It was analyzed how these parameters influence the power, the fuel consumption, the engine efficiency, the exhaust gas temperature, the heat energy available in the exhaust gasses, the overall efficiency of the cogeneration system, and the power to heat ratio.

TI  - Projected climate change impact on oceanic acidification
AB  - Background: Anthropogenic CO2 uptake by the ocean decreases the pH of seawater, leading to an 'acidification' which may have potential detrimental consequences on marine organisms 1. Ocean warming or circulation alterations induced by climate change has the potential to slowdown the rate of acidification of ocean waters by decreasing the amount of CO2 uptake by the ocean 2. However, a recent study showed that climate change affected the decrease in pH insignificantly 3. Here, we examine the sensitivity of future oceanic acidification to climate change feedbacks within a coupled atmosphere-ocean model and find that ocean warming dominates the climate change feedbacks. Results: Our results show that the direct decrease in pH due to ocean warming is approximately equal to but opposite in magnitude to the indirect increase in pH associated with ocean warming (ie reduced DIC concentration of the upper ocean caused by lower solubility of CO2). Conclusion: As climate change feedbacks on pH approximately cancel, future oceanic acidification will closely follow future atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This suggests the only way to slowdown or mitigate the potential biological consequences of future ocean acidification is to significantly reduce fossil-fuel emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere.

TI  - Bioengineering a Future Free of Marine Plastic Waste
AB  - Plastic waste has reached epidemic proportions worldwide, and the production of plastic continues to rise steadily. Plastic represents a diverse array of commonly used synthetic polymers that are extremely useful as durable, economically beneficial alternatives to other materials; however, despite the wide-ranging utility of plastic, the increasing accumulation of plastic waste in the environment has had numerous detrimental impacts. In particular, plastic marine debris can transport invasive species, entangle marine organisms, and cause toxic chemical bioaccumulation in the marine food web. The negative impacts of plastic waste have motivated research on new ways to reduce and eliminate plastic. One unique approach to tackle the plastic waste problem is to turn to nature's solutions for degrading polymers by leveraging the biology of naturally occurring organisms to degrade plastic. Advances in metagenomics, next generation sequencing, and bioengineering have provided new insights and new opportunities to identify and optimize organisms for use in plastic bioremediation. In this review, we discuss the plastic waste problem and possible solutions, with a focus on potential mechanisms for plastic bioremediation. We pinpoint two key habitats to identify plastic-biodegrading organisms: (1) habitats with distinct enrichment of plastic waste, such as those near processing or disposal sites, and (2) habitats with naturally occurring polymers, such as cutin, lignin, and wax. Finally, we identify directions of future research for the isolation and optimization of these methods for widespread bioremediation applications.

TI  - A perspective view of flow assurance in deepwater fields in Brazil
AB  - Significant part of the Brazilian oil reserves is located in ultra-deepwater fields (WD > 1500 m). In this scenario, flow assurance plays a crucial role due to the existing high pressures and low temperatures. This paper focuses on the strategies concerning flow assurance issues for the near future. These strategies are strongly based on our specific field experiences as well as on the foreseeable technological scenario. The future, as treated in this work, refers to the short and mid-term future and not to the prospective long term one. Thus, it will mainly discuss current R&D in flow assurance activities to tackle existing problems and the ones foreseen for the discoveries already in development. In order to facilitate the understanding of our vision, a brief summary about todays flow assurance issues is presented. Currently, the main flow assurance concerns are related to hydrate formation and wax deposition. Accordingly, design criteria and operational procedures to avoid these problems are briefly described. There is also an increasing concern about heavy and extra-heavy oil production, since a relevant part of recent offshore discoveries involves this type of oil. Among the initiatives that are being taken aiming at optimizing flow assurance design in the near future, one can mention: - rheology of heavy oil and water in oil emulsion; - heavy oil multiphase flow (gas-liquid) simulation; - hydrate slurry transportability; - improvements on wax deposition modeling; and - improvements on heat management.

TI  - Economic feasibility of an alternative fuel for sustainable short sea shipping: Case of Cross-Taiwan Strait Transport
AB  - Marine shipping has experienced increasing pressure in recent years to reduce its emissions of the greenhouse gases and many key air pollutants. The use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as ship fuel has been proposed as one of the effective solutions for the problem, mainly because it makes possible simultaneous reduction of both greenhouse gases and key air pollutants. In this study, we want to find out whether the technology can still be as beneficial a solution for ships operating in Taiwan Strait, where no ECA is currently designated while the LNG prices are typically much higher. We analyzed the economic feasibility of retrofitting existing vessels to run on LNG, using two typical types of vessels operating across the Strait as examples, one feeder and one ferry. We considered two different scenarios of HFO price forecast and three scenarios of LNG price forecast, and evaluated the fuel switch based on net present value, annualized net benefit, and the discounted payback period. Consistent with previous studies, our result found that the economic feasibility depends on the price differentials of HFO and LNG. Furthermore, we found the feasibility varied across types or operation methods of vessels. It is generally more feasible for the feeder than for the ferry. The technology investment has positive net present value under most scenarios for the feeder, but only half of the scenarios for the ferry. The investment requires payback period of more than 10 years under all but two cases, with the shortest one being 6.78 years. Marginal abatement cost ranges from -0.126 to 0.040 USD per kg-CO2e when considering GHG reduction alone, indicating minimal economic benefit realizable from the application. As a result, we suspected the strategy would attract as much interest from the marine shipping companies operating around Taiwan Strait. Â© 2018, Avestia Publishing.

TI  - Effects of shoreline hardening on nitrogen processing in estuarine marshes of the US mid-Atlantic coast
AB  - Multiple stressors affect estuarine shorelines including erosion, sea level rise and impacts from human development of adjacent lands. Increasingly common features of coastal development are vertical shoreline stabilization structures such as bulkheads. Bulkheads are designed to prevent land loss and flooding through the construction of a vertical wall anchored to the land. However, they break the connection between land and water and are barriers to upland plant migration. This disconnect can affect hydrology, alter nutrient and sediment supplies, and lead to marsh loss. We measured the effects of bulkheads on sediment nitrogen fluxes, including denitrification (DEN), at three representative estuarine shoreline types: natural marsh (no bulkhead), bulkhead without marsh, and bulkheads with marshes of varying widths. Sediment cores were taken mid-marsh or, 2 m seaward of bulkhead in sites lacking marsh in northern, central and southern coastal regions of North Carolina. Concentrations of N-2 and O-2 were measured using a membrane inlet mass spectrometer. In addition, sediment organic matter and inorganic nitrogen concentrations were quantified. Average DEN rate was 93.1 +/- A 7.0 A mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) with the highest rates in the summer and lowest rates in the winter. Sediment oxygen demand was positively correlated with DEN rate (R-2 = 0.43, p < 0.01), which suggests that DEN is affected by carbon lability. DEN was not affected by bulkhead presence (R-2 = 0.01, p = 0.52), but marsh presence significantly affected yearly DEN rates (R-2 = 0.13, p < 0.01). These data indicate that bulkheads do not directly affect nitrogen processing, but indirectly reduce cycling rates through marsh loss.

TI  - Exploring the macro-scale CO2 mitigation potential of photovoltaics and wind energy in Europe's energy transition
AB  - Replacing traditional technologies by renewables can lead to an increase of emissions during early diffusion stages if the emissions avoided during the use phase are exceeded by those associated with the deployment of new units. Based on historical developments and on counterfactual scenarios in which we assume that selected renewable technologies did not diffuse, we conclude that onshore and offshore wind energy have had a positive contribution to climate change mitigation since the beginning of their diffusion in EU27. In contrast, photovoltaic panels did not pay off from an environmental standpoint until very recently, since the benefits expected at the individual plant level were offset until 2013 by the CO2 emissions related to the construction and deployment of the next generation of panels. Considering the varied energy mixes and penetration rates of renewable energies in different areas, several countries can experience similar time gaps between the installation of the first renewable power plants and the moment in which the emissions from their infrastructure are offset. The analysis demonstrates that the time-profile of renewable energy emissions can be relevant for target setting and detailed policy design, particularly when renewable energy strategies are pursued in concert with carbon pricing through cap-and-trade systems.

TI  - Hydraulic Treatise of Untreated Water Reservoir Design of Indonesia's National Capital Integrated Coastal Development Offshore Dike
AB  - Coastal flooding and land subsidence are among the main issues for cities along the northern coast of Java Island. The Indonesian government planned to build integrated coastal protection along the northern coast. For the Capital City of Jakarta, the offshore dike will be complemented with a coastal reservoir to store freshwater for municipal uses. To overcome the occasional extreme weather, an untreated water reservoir (UWR) is required. This paper discussed the design of UWR pumping capacity and flood gate design of capital offshore dike through a hydrodynamic analysis with Delft3D. Flood hydrographs of extreme rainfall were created based on the data provided by the Ministry of National Planning. Bathymetry and tidal source were collected from GEBCO and NAOTide respectively. Hydrodynamic modeling was performed with variations on pump capacity and river input flows. The hydrodynamic model shows that the current UWR design can hold up to a 10-year flood without pumping. For more extreme floods, the UWR can also retain the water below the high water level with the help of pumps. The water elevation can be back to normal at-5.0 mLWS within a day of pumping with 1,600 m3/s.

TI  - Analysis of barge motion using strip and three dimensional theories
AB  - Strip theory is commonly used to analyze ship response to wave excitation for slender and shallow draft vessels. The two-dimensional nature of strip theory can introduce problems in analyzing barges, which have relatively low length-to-beam ratios and large draft. As part of recent OTEC work, threedimensional response theory has been developed into a computer model that can be applied to both slender and barge-like objects. The objectives of this study were to: (1) utilize both of these theories to analyze, in a systematic manner, box-like shapes for various drafts, periods of excitation and length-to-beam ratios (L/B), and (2) compare results as calculated from each theory. These results were for head-on seas only. Comparisons are based on the response amplitude operators of heave, surge, and pitch as a function of L/B which ranged from 1.0 to 8.0. For the case of the pitch response operators at L/B = 8.0, shallow draft results were within 22% of each other; the deep draft comparison was within 45%. Predicted response for heave showed less than 30% difference for both the shallow and deep draft floating boxes. Results from the two theories were also compared to published experimental data from model tests. The objects analyzed were a 78 Ã— 52 Ã— 5-cm barge model, and a model of a 90 Ã— 90 Ã— 40-m floating box (1:100 scale). Again, only head-on seas were considered. The comparison shows that strip theory does not predict reliable results for these L/B ratios; the threedimensional theory, however, does agree very well with the model-responses reported.

TI  - The influence of different types of marine fuel over the energy efficiency operational index
AB  - One of the main concerns of our society is certainly environmental protection. The international efforts for maintaining a clean environment are various and this paper refers to the efforts in the maritime transport field. The subject of our study is the concept of Energy Efficiency Operational Index (EEOI), developed to provide ship-owners with assistance in the process of establishing the emissions from ships in operation, and to suggest the methods for achieving their reduction. As a monitoring tool, EEOI represents the mass of CO2 emitted per unit of transport work. Using the software developed by the authors, it will emphasize the variation of the EEOI value for one vessel using different types of fuel during the laden and ballast voyages, for a period of three months, as stated in the Ship's Log Books. The main consumers considered are Main Engine, Diesel Generators and steam Boilers, and the types of fuel used will be as per charter party agreements and following the specific international and local rules and regulations. The results for the quality parameter EEOI and the average cost of achieving them will be included in compared cost-to-quality graphs, in order to underline the profitability of the studied methods for minimizing the air emissions.

TI  - Research Progress of Ship Exhaust Gas Treatment Technology
AB  - SOx, NOx and COx account for a high proportion of the exhaust gas of ships which take low quality heavy oil as fuel, resulting serious impact on the global environment. In this paper, three types of treatment technology of ship exhaust gas, i.e. pre-treatment technologies, in-cylinder control technologies and post treatment technologies, have been introduced. Various single post-treatment technologies for the control of ship exhaust gas pollutants emission, including marine scrubber, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) were reviewed. The advantages and limitations of various post-treatment technologies of Sox, NOX and COx were analyzed. In practice, single pollutant treatment technologies were not effective for ship exhaust emission reduction. The development of new desulfurizers, the optimization of integrated process flow, feasibility of the system operation, could be the future direction of ship exhaust post-treatment technology. There are two restrictions for the development of the ship exhaust treatment technology, which are the space limit and the cost requirements. Â© 2021 IEEE.

TI  - The value of pressure relief in hydraulic fracturing operations
AB  - In hydraulic fracturing operations, pressure pumping companies have long required a mechanism to relieve overpressure events prior to damage occurring to the systems. Traditionally, pressure pumpers have used mechanical or hydro-mechanical devices that are either one-Time use, such as burst disc, or springs under compression. Both systems have fundamental disadvantages in the context of efficient and cost effective operations. There is also the case that if the well requires pressure operations within the setting tolerances of these systems, they are not employed at all, risking overpressure damage to frac iron or wellhead equipment. This paper introduces a new method of pressure threshold assurance, with a pressure monitoring sy stem that is responsive enough to control a new design of rapid acting hydraulic valve actuator. In this application, this is mated with a standard gate valve that is installed on a bleed off leg from the frac flow lines. This allows very fast acting pressure relief, proactively protecting the system against costly over pressure events and potentially averting screen outs. A discussion of the design and function of the new solution, with due regard to limitations, best practices and workflows will be demonstrated, providing an examination of the results of operational case histories. Some of the benefits that have already been realized, and the potential for further implementation are proposed, as well as highlighting operational differences vs current technology that deliver value to pressure pumpers and operators. With a proven ability to relieve pressure within very tight tolerances, this new system allows for operational gains associated with resetting the system and retaining system integrity, but also allows operators to pump jobs in a much tighter pressure window than before. Unexpected benefits are that lower pressure wellhead equipment can be safely used without risk of costly integrity issues. Other examples of how this system provides surety to pressure pumping operations are examined. Â© 2017, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Environment-friendliness in Maritime Transport: Designing Smart Recharging Stations in North Adriatic Sea
AB  - Today, the electrification plays a crucial role in the challenge towards the energy sustainability. Focusing on the transportation field, the integration of carbon-free electric vehicles (cars, ships, trains and so on) and smart charging infrastructures based on renewable resources can strongly reduce the pollutants emissions of human mobility, while at the same time promoting the Smart City paradigm. In this context, the INTERREG project METRO (Maritime Environment-friendly TRanspOrt systems) is aimed at proposing innovative solutions for the improvement of the environmental sustainability in the North Adriatic maritime transport. The goal is to be reached by means of an integrated strategy, focusing on tackling both ships and ports. On one hand, by using electrical propulsion and energy storage systems onboard the ship, it is possible to decrease the vessel's environmental impact while sailing. On the other hand, a well-designed recharging infrastructure in the port can recharge the ship's energy storage system while at berth, possibly exploiting renewable carbon-free resources.

TI  - Wind energy and natural gas-based energy storage to promote energy security and lower emissions in island regions
AB  - Usually, isolated and remote areas, like islands, meet their electricity needs using oil-fired power generators. When available, natural gas can potentially substitute oil. Moreover, the high-quality wind energy potential found in many of these areas cannot be used extensively. Main reason is the operation of small-scale, weak electricity grids which cannot cope with wind energy intermittency. To compensate for that, we examine the combination of wind energy and energy storage. For the latter we focus on the technology of compressed air energy storage (CAES), which is suitable for scalable applications. To ensure the highest level of demand satisfaction, while avoiding system oversizing, we recommend a novel Wind-CAES system that allows switch from the CAES to the Brayton cycle when the stored energy is inadequate to meet demand. We develop a new algorithm for the sizing of such configurations, and use it on a case study that includes a typical, medium-scale Aegean Sea island in combination with three representative wind regimes. The results demonstrate that even in areas with relatively low-quality wind potential there are significant improvements in fuel use reduction, CO2 emissions and strengthening of energy supply security, while for island regions with higher-quality wind potential, the proposed solution also becomes cost-effective in comparison to other alternatives.

TI  - Environmental Benefits of Novel Nonhuman Food Inputs to Salmon Feeds
AB  - Global population growth and changing diets increase the importance, and challenges, of reducing the environmental impacts of food production. Farmed seafood is a relatively efficient way to produce protein and has already overtaken wild fisheries. The use of protein-rich food crops, such as soy, instead of fishmeal in aquaculture feed diverts these important protein sources away from direct human consumption and creates new environmental challenges. Single cell proteins (SCPs), including bacteria and yeast, have recently emerged as replacements for plant-based proteins in salmon feeds. Attributional life cycle assessment is used to compare salmon feeds based on protein from soy, methanotrophic bacteria, and yeast ingredients. All ingredients are modeled at the industrial production scale and compared based on seven resource use and emissions indicators. Yeast protein concentrate showed drastically lower impacts in all categories compared to soy protein concentrate. Bacteria meal also had lower impacts than soy protein concentrate for five of the seven indicators. When these target meals were incorporated into complete feeds the relative trends remain fairly constant, but benefits of the novel ingredients are dampened by high impacts from the nontarget ingredients. Particularly, primary production requirements (PPR) are about equal and constant across all feeds for both analyses since PPR was driven by fishmeal and oil. The bacteria-based feed has the highest climate change impacts due to the use of methane to feed the bacteria who then release carbon dioxide. Overall, the results of this study suggest that incorporating SCP ingredients into salmon feeds can help reduce the environmental impacts of salmon production. Continued improvements in SCP production would further increase the sustainability of salmon farming. Â© 2019 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Export and mesopelagic particle flux during a North Atlantic spring diatom bloom
AB  - Spring diatom blooms are important for sequestering atmospheric CO2 below the permanent thermocline in the form of particulate organic carbon (POC). We measured downward POC flux during a sub-polar North Atlantic spring bloom at 100m using thorium-234 (234Th) disequilibria, and below 100m using neutrally buoyant drifting sediment traps. The cruise followed a Lagrangian float, and a pronounced diatom bloom occurred in a 600km2 area around the float. Particle flux was low during the first three weeks of the bloom, between 10 and 30mgPOCm-2d-1. Then, nearly 20 days after the bloom had started, export as diagnosed from 234Th rose to 360-620mgPOCm-2d-1, co-incident with silicate depletion in the surface mixed layer. Sediment traps at 600 and 750m depth collected 160 and 150mgPOCm-2d-1, with a settled volume of particles of 1000-1500mLm-2d-1. This implies that 25-43% of the 100m POC export sank below 750m. The sinking particles were ungrazed diatom aggregates that contained transparent exopolymer particles (TEP). We conclude that diatom blooms can lead to substantial particle export that is transferred efficiently through the mesopelagic. We also present an improved method of calibrating the Alcian Blue solution against Gum Xanthan for TEP measurements. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A bibliometric analysis of literatures related to water-way transportation technology trends was carried out to sort out the research lineage in terms of major research countries, authors and keywords. The current development of waterway transportation technology was analyzed and summarized by comprehensively studying guiding policies, forward-looking reports and typical cases of -water-way transportation development both in China and abroad, and the future development trend of waterway transportation technology was judged. Research results show that waterway transportation technology will develop in the folio-wing five directions. In terms of waterway carriers, transport vessels will gradually require less manpower, and inland river, offshore and deep-sea vessels will form a spectrum. In terms of shipping infrastructure, the waterway facilities, energy supply, and information networks will be integrated. The ship-shore collaboration ability will be strengthened, the ship remote control can be realized, and the construction of shore-based ship control centre will become an important part of waterway transport infrastructure. In terms of ship power, increasingly stringent emission reduction targets will promote the development of ship clean energy, and the ship power system will be driven by multi-diversified energy and electricity. In terms of ship navigation, multi-ship cooperative transportation can improve transportation efficiency, and the inland river and offshore ship formation navigation becomes a new mode of transportation. In terms of maritime supervision and safety, the application of intelligent system makes ship human-caused accidents gradually reduce, and intelligent unmanned system rescue becomes a reality. The research results can effectively guide the future planning, design, construction and application of waterway transportation system, and provide strong support for cultivating and developing new waterway transportation industry and gradually realizing the future new generation shipping system. 6 figs, 30 refs.

TI  - Microbial decomposition of soil organic matter determined by edaphic characteristics of mangrove forests in East Asia
AB  - Mangrove forests cover only 0.1\% of the world's continental area; however, these are a substantial carbon sink owing to the high primary production and low rate of decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM).The extremely low decomposition rate of SOM in mangrove forests is believed to be caused by low oxygen and nutrient availability as well as recalcitrant biomass from mangrove. However, only a few studies have addressed the microbial mechanism that plays a key role in the decomposition of SOM. In this study, the decomposition of SUM were determined by conducting a field survey and an lab incubation experiment using soil samples from mangrove forests in three regions; Okinawa, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. In particular, we examined the occurrence of the enzymic larch mechanism, which involves phenolic inhibition of enzymic decomposition, in mangrove forest soils that highlights the importance of phenol oxidase as a key controlling factor. The results clearly showed that enzymic larch involved in the accumulation of SOM in the mangroves of Shenzhen and Hong Kong, whereas the accumulation of SOM in Okinawa was controlled by other mechanisms, such as the iron gate mechanism, which involves stabilization of soil carbon in iron-SOM complexes. The characteristics of mangrove forests, such as iron concentration, were shown as substantial determination factors in the dynamics of SOM. We concluded that the decomposition of SOM were strongly affected by the characteristics of mangrove forests, and the occurrence of enzymic latch in mangrove forests has a potential application in geoengineering technology to enhance the carbon sequestration capacity of mangrove forests.

TI  - Cyclic response of shallow helical anchors in a medium dense sand
AB  - There exists a potential niche application for helical anchors to foundations for offshore renewable energy structures in that relatively high anchoring capacities can be achieved with anchors installed using relatively small installation vessels. Quantifying cyclic effects for drained loading of helical anchors in sandy soils is complicated due to their strain softening response. Static and cyclic loading of a series of 152mm and 254mm diameter model helical anchor tests at shallow embedment in a medium dense sand were performed to assess accumulation of displacements and post cyclic degradation of capacity for up to 13,000 cycles. Calibrated design equations capture accumulation of displacement up to displacement at peak load, provided that accommodation is made for foundation geometry and relative level of cyclic uplift and compression loading.

AB  - Understanding of fault seal is crucial for assessing the storage capacity and leakage risks of a CO2 storage site, as it can significantly impact the project on across-fault and along-fault migration/leakage risking, as well as reservoir pressure predictions. Here we present a case study from Smeaheia offshore Norway to illustrate the importance of fault seal assessment. Leakage risk assessment has been systematically conducted for Smeaheia using the Evidence Support Logic and the Bow-tie methodologies. The results show that the Alpha structure has low across-fault and along-fault leakage risks, thus has a potential value to be added as extra volume for the CO2 storage project. The Beta structure shows large fault-related leakage risks, since it is a 3-way closure juxtaposed to the faulted/fractured Precambrian basement, with large uncertainties of across-fault and along-fault permeabilities of the Ã˜ygarden Fault Zone. Fault seal analysis of the relay ramps along the Vette Fault Zone shows that the Smeaheia site can be affected by the pressure drawdown from Troll depletion. However, Smeaheia also has pressure recharging potential from sea bed through Quaternary sediments. Regional dynamic modelling with input from fault seal studies and new pressure measurements can help narrow the storage capacity uncertainty window.

TI  - Design and calculation of mechanical system for solar-powered electric boat
AB  - Indonesian government has a flagship program that is to promote the nation through the maritime sector and make Indonesia as Global Maritime Fulcrum. To achieve that, sea transportation is very important for the development of Indonesia. But sea transportation is also the highest contributor to the air pollution and global warming. In order to reduce the source of global warming Indonesian Government has a strategic plan to gradually replace the use of fossil energy with renewable energy. One of the renewable energy that can be used effectively in Indonesia is solar energy, because Indonesia located along the equator and has a high intensity of sunlight that means it has excellent solar energy availability. In attempt to contribute to the Government's energy strategic plan, the research is aimed to design a solar-powered electric boat with single pilot. The project is a further development of the solar boat created by the Universitas Indonesia team that participated in the International Solar-boat Challenge competition in the Netherlands. The paper is focused on the design and calculation of its mechanical system. The system is divided into propulsion system, steering system, and bilge pump system. The research is conducted based on literature study, discussion with experts, and surveys to the solar-powered electric boat had been designed previously for the race. Collected data are then used as input for the calculation and simulation of the vessel being designed. It is expected that the study could optimize the mechanical system of the solar-powered electric boat, and can be developed for recreational use in Indonesian waters.

TI  - Cork/aluminium double-layer sandwich panels under impact loading for lightweight ship structures
AB  - To meet the reduction targets of greenhouse gas emissions by highly polluting vessels such as cruise ships, several strategies are possible: the introduction of new fuels (i.e. LNG, hydrogen and biofuel), the installation of more efficient engines, the electrification of the propulsion systems, the lightening of the structures, the energy efficiency improvement of the auxiliary services (i.e. air conditioning). In particular, vessels weight reduction can be achieved by introducing new materials. The aim of this work was to manufacture an innovative laminate, which comes from the combination of a cork layer and an aluminium honeycomb sandwich, intended to provide an eco-friendly and lightweight solution for structures potentially destined to marine applications, such as ship decks, hulls or cabins' construction. The suggested solution is expected to combine several functions and properties, such as low density and thermal and acoustic insulation - which potentially influence propulsion and auxiliaries fuel consumption-as well as good mechanical performances. The investigation was particularly focused on the potentialities offered by the cork layer, traditionally addressed at insulation purposes, in supporting and enhancing the impact-absorption capabilities of the aluminium honeycomb structure, especially in view of the potential marine applications which often suffer from low-velocity impact events. Having a dual function: (i) to lighten the superstructures and (ii) to promote the thermal and acoustic insulation, by thus influencing, respectively, propulsion and auxiliaries fuel consumption. For instance, the suggested solution could be used for cabins' construction. In the present work, the energy absorption capabilities of the new lightweight structure were evaluated by means of low-velocity impact tests. An excellent response, comparable to that of double-layer aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels, was observed, suggesting that the new structure is a promising and sustainable alternative for marine constructions.

TI  - Feasibility of using reactive silicate particles with temperature-responsive coatings to enhance the security of geologic carbon storage
AB  - The large-scale deployment of geologic carbon storage will require minimizing the risk of CO2 leakage. Here we report on a novel strategy to seal leakage pathways by injecting functionalized reactive calcium silicate (CaSiO3) particles. The particles consist of a mineral silicate core within a temperature-sensitive Poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) coating that limits contact between the core and the surrounding CO2(aq) above a switching temperature making them relatively unreactive deep in the subsurface. If the CO2 leaks to shallower depths and cooler temperatures, the coatings would extend and enable the silicate core to react with CO2(aq) to form solid carbonate precipitates that reduce the permeability of the fracture or flow path. A combined laboratory- and simulation-based investigation was conducted to explore key early-stage research questions related to the feasibility of this leakage management strategy. Sand columns were injected with either coated or uncoated CaSiO3 particles and the permeability was measured before and after exposure to CO2. Experiments were conducted at 35 degrees C and 70 degrees C, a range that spans the switching temperature for the coatings. Results show that at the cooler temperature the coating effectively enabled reaction and permeability reduction. At higher temperatures, the coated particles limited mineral carbonation and the permeability decrease was minimal compared to columns with uncoated particles. The morphology and location of the precipitates provides insight about permeability evolution. Model simulations of 2D radial particle transport from an injection point provided insight into the effects of particle size, coating properties, and concentrations of particles in several representative rock formations.

TI  - Submudline silo system: A cost-effective alternative to conventional subsea protection structures
AB  - A submudline protection silo system has been developed. The silo is a cylindrical shaped steel structure having a diameter of 9 metres and a total weight of 125 tonnes. The installation method described in the paper is presented in a step by step manner. The structure is transported from shore to the offshore site by a supply vessel. The silo structure is transferred from the supply vessel to a drilling rig. When the silo is placed on the seabed, an installation tool is run by the drilling riser and docked into the silo. The penetration of the silo into the seabed is achieved by using standard equipment onboard a drilling rig only. The excavation process is fulfilled by water jetting and the soil is removed by electrically driven mass pumps. The penetration force is achieved by creating a suction underneath the silo floor. The silo is equipped with systems to remove drill cuttings and excessive cement during drilling operation. The top of the silo has a roof system to protect the X-mas tree from falling objects. Maintenance and inspection of the silo x-mas tree is done by a guided ROV through a hatch system in silo roof. Copyright 1992, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Prospects of artificial tree for solar desalination
AB  - Seawater and brackish water desalination provides a viable alternative to clean water supply for regions lacking fresh water sources or facing severe droughts. Current desalination technologies, however, are energy-expensive and environmentally unfriendly. Mimicking the natural transpiration process of mangrove trees that are able to survive in high-salinity environment, an artificial tree is conceived as a next-generation desalination system that can be entirely solar-powered and potentially achieve zero-liquid discharge and resource recovery. The artificial tree will float on saline water and be composed of synthetic roots that uptake and pretreat feed water, a synthetic trunk that lifts water up via capillary action through its microporous xylem, and synthetic leaves that efficiently convert sunlight to localized heat for water evaporation through their pores. Water vapor is condensed for clean water production while salt is collected for resource recovery or proper disposal. Science and technologies available and needed for realizing the artificial tree system are critically reviewed.

TI  - Consideration regarding the reduction of pollutions emissions by increasing energy efficiency in ship operations
AB  - The use of experimental investigation techniques in the research of internal combustion engines has contributed substantially to their progress and development over time. The performances obtained in the development of modern engines have been strongly influenced by the emergence and development of the investigation equipment, especially the laser and the modern computing technique. Maritime transport generates about 4% of the total CO2 emissions produced by human activities, which means that its carbon value is almost as large as that of Germany. Emissions from this sector are not yet internationally regulated, but this issue is currently being debated within the IMO and the United Nations Framework Convention on climate change (UNFCCC). Of the strategies to reduce pollutant emissions from ships, identified so far, the technical solutions are the first ones that have been implemented on board. The advantage of using technical solutions onboard ships is the high efficiency of reducing a product or several pollutant products, but the main disadvantage is the high cost of implementing and operating them on board ships.

TI  - Data Acquisition for Residential Energy Management Employing IoT Using ThingSpeak
AB  - In the recent times, due to the depletion of fossil fuels, the main focus is on the utilization of renewable energy. Solar generation is preferred in metropolitan cities due to lack of wind energy or tidal energy which are available only at the coastal areas. The energy generated from a roof top mounted solar panel during the day is either stored in battery or utilized for the connected load of that particular capacity. It is necessary to adopt data mining and data analytics about consumed power from both the solar panel system and grid connected loads. This is used for various in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) which plays a major role in energy management in modern power system. Data is collected as raw input in the form of voltage and current which is further processed using Node microcontroller unit (NODEMCU) in order to get the magnitude of various power consumptions using data mining technique. This data is later sent to a cloud based platform ThingSpeak for data analytics. It helps in plotting daily and annual load curves using data analytics technique. ThingSpeak helps to view data in various electronic gadgets with the help of a dedicated Application using IoT (Internet of Things). Â© 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Enhanced growth of halophyte plants in biochar-amended coastal soil: roles of nutrient availability and rhizosphere microbial modulation
AB  - Soil health is essential and irreplaceable for plant growth and global food production, which has been threatened by climate change and soil degradation. Degraded coastal soils are urgently required to reclaim using new sustainable technologies. Interest in applying biochar to improve soil health and promote crop yield has rapidly increased because of its multiple benefits. However, effects of biochar addition on the saline-sodic coastal soil health and halophyte growth were poorly understood. Response of two halophytes, Sesbania (Sesbania cannabina) and Seashore mallow (Kosteletzkya virginica), to the individual or co-application of biochar and inorganic fertilizer into a coastal soil was investigated using a 52 d pot experiment. The biochar alone or co-application stimulated the plant growth (germination, root development, and biomass), primarily attributed to the enhanced nutrient availability from the biochar-improved soil health. Additionally, the promoted microbial activities and bacterial community shift towards the beneficial taxa (e.g. Pseudomonas and Bacillus) in the rhizosphere also contributed to the enhanced plant growth and biomass. Our findings showed the promising significance because biochar added at an optimal level (<= 5\%) could be a feasible option to reclaim the degraded coastal soil, enhance plant growth and production, and increase soil health and food security.

TI  - Net Ecosystem Carbon Balance in a North Carolina, USA, Salt Marsh
AB  - Salt marshes have among the highest carbon (C) burial rates of any ecosystem and often rely on C accumulation to gain elevation and persist in locations with accelerating sea level rise. Net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB), the accumulation or loss of C resulting from vertical CO2 and CH4 gas fluxes, lateral C fluxes, and sediment C inputs, varies across salt marshes; thus, extrapolation of NECB to an entire marsh is challenging. Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs to salt marshes impact NECB by influencing each component of NECB, but differences in the impacts of fertilization between edge and interior marsh must be considered when scaling up. NECB was estimated for the 0.5 km(2) Spartina alterniflora marsh area of Freeman Creek, NC, under control and fertilized conditions at both interior and edge berm sites. Annual CO2 fluxes were nearly balanced at control sites, but fertilization significantly increased net CO2 emissions at edge sites. Lateral C export, modeled using respiration rates, represented a significant C loss that increased with fertilization in both edge and interior marsh. Sediment C input was a significant C source in the interior, nearly doubling with fertilization, but represented a small source on the edge. When extrapolating C exchanges to the entire marsh, including edge which comprised 17\% of the marsh area, the marsh displayed net loss of C despite a net C gain in the interior. Fertilization increased net C loss fivefold. Extrapolation of NECB to whole marshes requires inclusion of C fluxes for both edge and interior marsh. Plain Language Summary Salt marsh ecosystems rely on carbon accumulation to increase elevation and survive sea level rise. The amount of carbon accumulated in a marsh is the net result of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, fixation of carbon by photosynthesis, export of dissolved carbon to the creek, and accumulation of organic carbon in sediments deposited on the surface. Because each component varies between edge and interior marsh, it is challenging to estimate carbon accumulation for a whole marsh system. It is not currently known how increasing nitrogen pollution impacts carbon accumulation for a whole marsh. To find out, we compared measurements of carbon accumulation in fertilized and unfertilized plots in the edge and interior of a salt marsh at Freeman Creek, North Carolina, USA. Overall, the marsh gained carbon in the interior but lost carbon on the edge, leading to a loss of about 50,000 kg C year(-1) across the 0.5 km(2) marsh area. However, under fertilized conditions, Freeman Creek marsh carbon loss increased nearly fivefold overall as a result of the large increase in carbon loss from the edge marsh. This study shows that increasing nitrogen pollution in coastal waters will cause increasing net carbon loss in marshes.

TI  - Production of recyclates - compared with virgin Plastics - a LCA Study
AB  - Plastix A/S is a Danish cleantech company transforming discarded fishing trawls and nets into valuable green raw materials. Plastix' technology and processes solve a maritime waste problem and contribute to a more circular green economy and reduce landfilling, marine pollution, CO2 emissions and especially loss of valuable resources. Plastix' recycling technology enables recovery of discarded fishing trawls and nets via mechanical and thermal processes transforming the waste into valuable recycles which can be converted into plastic products replacing virgin raw materials. The performance has been proved through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study. The results from the LCA study are compared with the production of virgin materials. The results of the LCA show that especially the carbon footprint is remarkable better for Oceanix than for virgin plastics. Oceanix HDPE is 5 times better than virgin HDPE, when talking about the carbon foot print, and the results for Oceanix PP and Oceanix PA6 are 5 times and 20 times better compared with virgin PP and PA6. Also other environmental indicators are better for Oceanix compared with virgin plastics.

TI  - Delayed current zeros in FPSO offshore units
AB  - It is well established that when short-circuit occurs close to generators'terminals, the instantaneous value of the fault current through the circuit-breaker may not reach zero amperes for some considerable time, so called delayed current zero phenomenon. Therefore circuit-breakers may not be suitable to clear the fault under this condition. Today's floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) units are very large in terms of installed generation capacity, in the range of 100 MVA, and in terms of number of medium voltage motors, many of them connected directly to the generation voltage level. This leads to a very favorable condition for the occurrence of delayed currents zeros in FPSO's electrical power systems. This paper presents the results obtained in the analysis for a typical FPSO electrical power system. The main objective of this analysis is to verify the presence of delayed currents zeros, the non-zero times and how the system operational condition and type of event may influence the results.

TI  - Quantitative estimation of sea surface temperature increases resulting from the thermal discharge of coastal power plants in China
AB  - The operation of coastal nuclear power plants and thermal power plants (CNATPPs) can cause regional sea surface temperature (SST) increases. To assess their effects on coastal ecosystems, the scope and extent of their impacts must be understood. We aimed to quantitatively assess the SST increases caused by thermal discharge under climate warming by comparing SSTs between control and test groups and among different offshore buffer zones based on daily MODIS SST data from 2002 to 2017. The results showed that (1) a good correlation occurred between the CNATPP installed capacity and SST increase in the 0â€“2 km offshore waters; (2) the SST increase caused by thermal discharge was the largest in summer and the smallest in winter; and (3) the effect of thermal discharge occurred within 2 km offshore when the installed capacity exceeded 2000 MW and extended to 5 km when it reaches more than 4000 MW.

TI  - Ironing Out Fe Residence Time in the Dynamic Upper Ocean
AB  - Although iron availability has been shown to limit ocean productivity and influence marine carbon cycling, the rates of processes driving iron's removal and retention in the upper ocean are poorly constrained. Using(234)Th- and sediment-trap data, most of which were collected through international GEOTRACES efforts, we perform an unprecedented observation-based assessment of iron export from and residence time in the upper ocean. The majority of these new residence time estimates for total iron in the surface ocean (0-250 m) fall between 10 and 100 days. The upper ocean residence time of dissolved iron, on the other hand, varies and cycles on sub-annual to annual timescales. Collectively, these residence times are shorter than previously thought, and the rates and timescales presented here will contribute to ongoing efforts to integrate iron into global biogeochemical models predicting climate and carbon dioxide sequestration in the ocean in the 21st century and beyond.

Laboratory-based experimental validation of the concept is presented in this paper showing the potential of a significant amount of energy harvesting in difficult to access locations and environments including downhole in multilaterals where limited usable energy sources are available besides the flow to power autonomous circuits and systems for monitoring and control applications.

TI  - Electrical and energy systems integration for maritime environment-friendly transportation

To reach the planned goals, the most promising approach is working both on ships improvement and ports redesign. The latter must enable the new green ships supply with sustainable electrical energy, by integrating shore connection systems, local renewables, and energy storage systems. In this paper, a methodology to obtain such an objective is proposed, capable of taking into account both shipsâ€™ and portsâ€™ characteristics. The methodology workflow is explained through a case study, where two shore connection power sizes and two different operative approaches for recharging the ship onboard energy storage are considered. A discussion about the most suitable energy storage technologies is also provided.

TI  - Floating production mooring integrity JIP - Key findings
AB  - Over the last two years Noble Denton has been undertaking a Joint Industry Project (JIP) to investigate how to improve the integrity of the moorings used by Floating Production Systems (FPSs). The JIP has surveyed the world wide performance of all types of FPS mooring systems including FPSOs, semi submersible production units and Spars. Wide ranging support from 23 sponsoring organizations including operators, floating production contractors, regulatory authorities, equipment suppliers and inspection companies has enabled access to a significant pool of data. This paper utilizes the JIP data to discuss the following: â€¢ Causes of system degradation â€¢ Consequences of mooring failure â€¢ Key areas to check on a mooring system â€¢ Fatigue implications of friction induced bending â€¢ Options for in-water inspection â€¢ The importance of connector design â€¢ Methods to detect line failure â€¢ Contingency planning A few pioneering floating production units have now been on station for many years. Review of inspection data from these units shows that selective repair may be needed to maintain the design specification right up to the end of the operational life. It has been found that wear can be faster on leeside, as opposed to windward lines and that certain weighted chain designs are susceptible to damage. The likelihood of line failure and the implications need to be better appreciated. Following failure, it may well take several months to implement a full repair, due to a lack of spares/procedures and possible non-availability of suitable vessels. However, it has been found that carefully planned and coordinated inspection operations can detect potential issues early on before more serious deterioration takes place. In general, mooring monitoring/instrumentation and access for in-water inspection seem not to be as advanced as might be expected for a system which is safety critical. Hence good practice recommendations are included which can be applied to both existing and planned future units. Â© 2005, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - The rapid return of marine-derived nutrients to a freshwater food web following dam removal
AB  - Dam removal is increasingly being recognized as a viable river restoration action. Although the main beneficiaries of restored connectivity are often migratory fish populations, little is known regarding recovery of other parts of the freshwater food web, particularly terrestrial components. We measured stable isotopes in key components to the freshwater food web: salmon, freshwater macroinvertebrates and a river specialist bird, American dipper (Cinclus mexicanus), before and after removal of the Elwha Dam, WA, USA. Less than a year after dam removal, salmon returned to the system and released marine-derived nutrients (MDN). In that same year we documented an increase in stable-nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios in American dippers. These results indicate that MDN from anadromous fish, an important nutrient subsidy that crosses the aquatic-terrestrial boundary, can return rapidly to food webs after dams are removed which is an important component of ecosystem recovery.

TI  - Consequences of selecting technology pathways on cumulative carbon dioxide emissions for the United Kingdom
AB  - The UK has an ambitious target of an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, to be reached using a series of â€˜carbon budgetsâ€™ to aid policy development. Current energy systems modelling methods do not explore, or are unable to account for, physical (thermodynamic) limits to the rate of change of infrastructure. The power generation sector has a variety of technological options for this low-carbon transition. We compare physically constrained scenarios that accentuate either carbon capture and storage, fastest plausible nuclear new build, or fastest plausible build rate of offshore wind. We set these in the context of the UK's legislated fifth carbon budget, which has a comprehensive range of carbon reduction measures with respect to business-as-usual. The framework for our scenario comparison uses our novel system dynamics model to substantiate the policy's ability to meet 2035 emissions targets while maintaining financial productivity and socially expected employment levels. For an ambitious nuclear new build programme we find that even if it stays on track it is more expensive than offshore wind generation and delays emissions reductions. This affects the cumulative emissions and impacts on the UK's ability to contribute to international climate change targets. If delays or cancellation occur to the deployment programmes of carbon capture and storage technologies or nuclear new build, we suggest the electricity and decarbonisation targets can by met by a fast growth of offshore wind generation with no change to financial and employment levels.

TI  - Fluid-Structure interaction: Lowering subsea structure/equipment in splash zone during installation
AB  - Successful installation of subsea structures and equipment is critical for offshore campaigns in development of deep-water fields. This paper presents a novel approach using Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) to predict wave induced motions, wave loads, dynamic stresses and deformation of subsea structure and equipment in the splash zone during installation. This approach combines transient multiphase CFD simulation including dynamic mesh motion with transient nonlinear Computational Structural Dynamics including tension forces in non-linear flexible slings. This proposed approach has been successfully implemented for lowering of a subsea manifold in splash zone during installation. This paper has many potential applications, such as, installation of manifold, subsea tree, PLET/PLEM, suction pile, pump station, or other subsea structure and equipment. In this coupled FSI approach, pressure loads on the structure due to wave slamming from CFD model is mapped to FEA model of structure-sling assembly, which provides motion and deformation to CFD model. The results clearly show the advantage of this FSI approach to capture the coupled physics of wave slamming and its interaction with the structure and subsequent motions of structure which is being lowered in the splash zone that other approaches cannot capture. Structural integrity of the subsea structure and equipment as well as the sling forces is well evaluated and predicted with this approach. Traditional approaches for prediction of the motions and loads of subsea structure/equipment during installation rely on simplified formulations or empirical equations or model test to determine the wave loads on structures. It cannot simulate wave-structure interaction, nor the dynamic stress and deformation of structure/equipment due to wave-structure interaction. The approach proposed in this paper provides a state-of-the-art FSI tool which enhances understanding wave-structure interaction in splash zone during installation. The dynamic stress obtained by using this approach can be used for quantifying fatigue damage of every component on the structure/equipment due to wave loads in splash zone during installation.

TI  - Optimal Design of Ship's Hybrid Power System for Efficient Energy
AB  - The International Maritime Organization regulations on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) from ships require efficient dealing with this complex techno-economic and highly political problem through joint efforts of all major stakeholders from the shipbuilding industry and ship operations. The key problems of any research in the field of renewable energy, including power generation, storage, transformation and distribution, and the issues associated with limited power generation for specific loads, are the same issues that are experienced in the implementation of electric distribution technologies onboard ships. This paper analyses the effects of efficient shipping using the solar panel system and batteries to ensure continuous power supply, regardless of the weather conditions. The logistics chain of this control architecture is modelled by Colored Petri Nets. The economic analysis examines the annual costs of fuel consumption, the initial capital cost, total net cost and CO2 emissions.

TI  - A novel station online re-commssioning strategy for MMC-MTDC systems
AB  - A multi-terminal VSC-HVDC system based on the MMC technology (MMC-MTDC) has great application prospects for city center in-feed, grid connection and offshore wind energy integration because of its flexible power transmission. However, how to re-commission a converter station (after maintenance) online to the operating system without expensive dc Circuit Breakers(CBs) presents a huge challenge. By employing the structural characteristics of MMC, followed by certain sequential operations of the disconnectors (DSs) at dc side are proposed to implement the station online re-commissioning instead of using dc CBs. The charging process of a MMC station with a combination of ac and dc sources is studied firstly, and then a one-order circuit has been assumed to simplify the complicated charging process to get the potential maximum surge current and its decay constant. In order to decrease the surge current after closing the DSs at the positive and negative polarities separately, the valve should be blocked and the dc voltage of the operating system should be decreased properly. At last, the valve will be deblocked with increased dc voltage at the rated value. Besides easy operation, the strategy doesn't increase any cost. The simulation of a real three-terminal VSC-HVDC system, which is currently under construction in Shantou, China, has been performed in PSCAD/EMTDC to verify the strategy. Â© 2014 IEEE.

TI  - The capture and, retention evaluation of a stormwater gross pollutant trap design
AB  - Gross pollutant traps (GPT) are designed to capture and retain visible street waste, such as anthropogenic litter and organic matter. Blocked screens, low/high downstream tidal waters and flows operating above/below the intended design limits can hamper the operations of a stormwater GPT. Under these adverse operational conditions, a recently developed GPT was evaluated. Capture and retention experiments were conducted on a 50\% scale model with partially and fully blocked screens, placed inside a hydraulic flume. Flows were established through the model via an upstream channel-inlet configuration. Floatable, partially buoyant, neutrally buoyant and sinkable spheres were released into the GPT and monitored at the outlet. These experiments were repeated with a pipe-inlet configured GPT. The key findings from the experiments were of practical significance to the design, operation and maintenance of GPTs. These involved an optimum range of screen blockages and a potentially improved inlet design for efficient gross pollutant capture/retention operations. For example, the outlet data showed that the capture and retention efficiency deteriorated rapidly when the screens were fully blocked. The low pressure drop across the retaining screens and the reduced inlet flow velocities were either insufficient to mobilise the gross pollutants, or the GPT became congested. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A desalination method utilising low-grade waste heat energy
AB  - A new desalination method was proposed in this work, utilizing low-grade waste heat from the power plant, allowing co-generation of fresh water with electricity. The desalination system analysed in this study makes use of simple concepts, such as Torricelli vacuum, flash evaporation and siphon effect, to reduce the overall operating power consumption of the plant. An experimental plant has been built and tested in an existing thermal power plant at Chennai, India. The plant utilized the warm saline reject water from the power plant condenser to feed the evaporator without using a separate feed water pump. The amount of freshwater produced by this plant is nearly 1/200 times of the sea water supplied for the available temperature gradient of 8.7 degrees C. It is a low-cost system when compared with conventional desalination technologies, with energy consumption per unit volume estimated at 2.62kWh/m(3) of fresh water generated. It operates at low temperatures, low pressure conditions and produces fresh water of excellent quality. The successful operation of the plant has provided valuable experience and information related to the behaviour of the proposed desalination system.

TI  - A novel method to enhance methane hydrate exploitation efficiency via forming impermeable overlying CO2 hydrate cap
AB  - To enhance the exploitation efficiency of natural gas hydrate by decreasing the yield of water, a novel ``reservoir reformation{'' concept is proposed that involves the reformation of a natural gas hydrate reservoir by constructing an artificial impermeable overlying CO2 hydrate cap. The feasibility of this concept has been demonstrated in this laboratory-scale experiment. After reformation by injecting CO2 emulsion into the permeable overburden, a confined environment with an impermeable CO2 hydrate cap is successfully constructed for depressurization operation. The cap can maintain mechanical stability until the end of production process. With the protection provided by the artificial CO2 hydrate cap, the production efficiency was greatly improved to 83.3\% and the water yield is remarkably decreased. Moreover, the optimal CO2/H2O volume ratio of the emulsion for forming the desired CO2 hydrate cap was confirmed to be 1:1. The formation of CO2 hydrate cap can also protect the geological stability of depleted methane hydrate zones and seal a large amount of CO2, which is of both energetic and environmental significance; however, intensive and extensive research should be conducted in the future.

TI  - Cost comparison in various CO2 ocean disposal options
AB  - CO2 ocean disposal is one of several ways proposed to mitigate the greenhouse gas effect. In this paper, we estimate the cost of various CO2 disposal options. The system consists of a conventional pulverized coal power plant, CO2 separation using an amine scrubber, liquefaction and transportation. In this investigation, the power plant and the CO2 separation plant are common. The liquefaction process and transportation systems are different. We evaluate the costs of pipeline, liquid CO2 tanker for CO2 lake, liquid CO2 tanker dispersion, dry ice tanker and CO2 dispersion by OTEC. The effect of distance between a power plant and the disposal site, plant size, and plant efficiency on the cost for each case is evaluated. Costs of ocean disposal options are estimated about 90 to 180 per tonne of CO2 avoided. The least cost transportation option is dependent on the distance between power plant and site.

TI  - Achieving Highly Efficient Atmospheric CO2 Uptake by Artificial Upwelling
AB  - Artificial upwelling (AU) is considered a potential means of reducing the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2. It has been suggested that AU has significant effects on regional carbon sink or source characteristics, and these effects are strongly influenced by certain technical parameters, the applied region, and the season. In this study, we simulated the power needed to raise the level of deep ocean water (DOW) to designated plume trapping depths in order to evaluate the effect of changing the source DOW depth and the plume trapping depth on carbon sequestration ability and efficiency. A carbon sequestration efficiency index (CSEI) was defined to indicate the carbon sequestration efficiency per unit of power consumption. The results suggested that the CSEI and the carbon sequestration ability exhibit opposite patterns when the DOW depth is increased, indicating that, although raising a lower DOW level can enhance the regional carbon sequestration ability, it is not energy-efficient. Large variations in the CSEI were shown to be associated with different regions, seasons, and AU technical parameters. According to the simulated CSEI values, the northeast past of the Sea of Japan is most suitable for AU, and some regions in the South China Sea are not suitable for increasing carbon sink.

TI  - Mapping an urban ecosystem service: quantifying carbon storage in soils at an island-city on a wide scale
AB  - This study examined the temporal and spatial patterns of carbon storage in an island-city by evaluation of soils across the entire urban and mangrove forests areas during dry, rainy and norths seasons of 2013-2014. The ecosystem service (mitigation of climatic change) was quantified and mapped on a wide scale in Carmen Island, Campeche, Mexico by using geo-statistics methods. Carbon sequestration rate and several important physicochemical parameters on a wide scale in the city were determined at 30 cm depth, which is the most relevant depth affected by land management practices. An evident seasonal pattern was observed for organic carbon, exhibiting its highest levels at the beginning of the dry season. In addition, a geographical distribution analysis identified mangrove and flooded sites as those zones in which carbon storage was higher, concluding that hydrogeology and dominant vegetation were the factors with a greater influence on carbon storage rate. Carbon storage rate obtained in this work (1.07 Kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) was comparable with those obtained for isolated and forested wetlands in others regions of the world. This study is the first in the region that provides a high-resolution map of soil carbon stocks in a mixed and complex frame where an important urban zone and mangrove forest co-exist.

TI  - Soil carbon stocks and their primary origin at mature mangrove ecosystems in the estuary of Fukido River, Ishigaki Island, southwestern Japan
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems play an important role in carbon (C) accumulation in tropical and subtropical regions. Below-ground deep anoxic soil is especially important for C accumulation. However, quantitative data on below-ground soil C stocks in mangrove ecosystems are lacking compared with data on above-ground biomass. In addition, soil C accumulation processes in mangrove ecosystems have not been sufficiently clarified. In this study, we quantified soil C stocks and focused on the mass of fallen litter and below-ground roots, which are produced by tree and that may directly influence soil C stocks in a mature subtropical mangrove in the estuary of Fukido River, Ishigaki Island, southwestern Japan. The principal species in this study site were Bruguiera gymnorhiza and Rhizophora stylosa, and total above-ground biomass at the site was 80.7 +/- 1.3 (mean +/- SD) Mg C ha(-1) over the period from 2014 to 2016. Litter was collected in six litter traps from May 2013 to November 2016, it ranged from 7.8 to 11.5 Mg C ha(-1), with the major proportion of litter being from foliage (leaves and stipules). The root C density at 90-cm depth was 27.1 +/- 11.3 Mg C ha(-1). The soil C stock in the mangrove forest at a depth of 90 cm at the study site was 251.0 +/- 34.8 Mg C ha(-1), and it seems to be lower value in the tropical region but it to be higher in subtropical East Asian mangrove sites. Dead roots, especially dead fine roots, but not fallen litter, were significantly positively correlated with soil C stocks. The delta C-13 values obtained from soils ranged from -29.3 parts per thousand to -27.0 parts per thousand; these values are consistent with those for below-ground fine roots. These results strongly suggest that dead fine roots could be a main factor controlling soil C stocks at this study site.

TI  - Planetary bioengineering on Earth to return and maintain the atmospheric carbon dioxide to pre-industrial levels: Assessing potential mechanisms
AB  - We are all familiar with the episodes in the deep time history of Earth that enabled life to emerge in such abundance. Episodes like the formation of a Moon large enough and near enough to cause tides in the Earth's waters and rocks, a core of sufficient iron with sufficient angular momentum to generate a protective magnetosphere around Earth, and assumption of a planetary axis angle that generates the ecological variation of our seasonal cycles. The living things that did arise on this planet have been modifying their habitats on Earth since they first appeared. Modifications that include the greening of Earth by photosynthetic organisms, which turned a predominantly reducing atmosphere into an oxidising one, the consequent precipitation of iron oxides into iron ore strata, and the formation of huge deposits of limestone by calcifying organisms. The episodes on which we wish to concentrate are 1) the frequent involvement of marine calcifiers (coccolithophores, foraminifera, molluscs, crustacea, corals, echinoderms), that have been described as ecosystem engineers modifying habitats in a generally positive way for other organisms, and 2) the frequent involvement of humans in changing the Earth's biosphere in a generally negative way for other organisms. The fossil record shows that ancestral marine calcifiers had the physiology to cope with both acidified oceans and great excesses of atmospheric CO2 periodically throughout the past 500 million years, creating vast remains of shells as limestone strata in the process. So, our core belief is that humankind must look to the oceans for a solution to present-day climate change. The marine calcifiers of this planet have a track record of decisively modifying both oceans and atmospheres but take millions of years to do it. On the other hand, humanity works fast; in just a few thousand years we have driven scores of animals and plants to extinction, and in just a few hundred years we have so drastically modified our atmosphere that, arguably, we stand on the verge of extinction ourselves. Of all Earth's ecosystems, those built around biological calcifiers, which all convert organic carbon into inorganic limestone, are the only ones that offer the prospect of permanent net removal of CO2 from our atmosphere. These are the carbon-removal biotechnologies we should be seeking to exploit.

AB  - Since the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals target, offshore photovoltaic has attracted much attention at home and abroad. Offshore photovoltaic has the characteristics of saving land resources, protecting water bodies, and efficient power generation. Taking photovoltaic floating body as the research object, a numerical model is established to analyze the force of different permutation combinations under wave action, which provides a theoretical basis for subsequent research on mooring system. The research shows that the floating block at the front end has a large force, that is, it is greatly affected by the breaking of waves. The force of the photovoltaic floating block is uniform before and after, which is not affected by wave breaking and attenuation. Â© 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Fuelling regional growth: Still a dream or a concrete possibility?
AB  - In the framework of FP7 funding scheme, the project H2OCEAN (grant agreement n. 654871) has been developed, investigating a proof-of-concepts of a multi-use ocean platform, able to harvest energy, produce and store energy in the form of compressed H2, together with a multi-trophic aquaculture and bio-waste treatment and drinkable water production. The idea was to design a system able to convert renewable energy sources and biological conversions into energy, food and water, basics to ensure human health. The challenge has been to stress the multi-use ocean platform to be stand alone, far from the shore, able to produce an excess of energy and water and obviously food and send them to the shore to be sold at a reasonable price. Special boats has been conceived to harvest energy from wind and waves, produce drinkable water for human use and for the electrolyser, special boats with alkaline electrolysers for oxygen and hydrogen generation and storage. At a glance figures describing the ocean platform are: H2 production: 74 kNm3/h and O2 37,5 kNm3/h. Aquaculture: 10 k ton/year. Drinkwater 20 m3/h. To achieve these KPIs, 95 Wave Energy converter and 67 Vertical Axis Wind turbines are included together with 34 aquaculture cages and support ships. Issues are presented in this paper and are partially solved by a a real demonstration platform in the Project The Blue Growth Farm (grant agreement n. 774426). This pilot platform (20 x 20 m) will be build and tested at NOEL, located close to Strait of Messina. Test results will be utilised to scale-up the design of a larger floating platform able to harvest energy and breed certain species of fish and molluscs.

TI  - CO2 storage development: status of the large European CCS projects with EEPR funding
AB  - This paper presents an overview of the CO2 storage element of the projects that are part of the European CCS Demonstration Project Network, an FP7 funded project to support the knowledge exchange among the CCS projects that have received funding under the EEPR framework. These projects include the ROAD project (The Netherlands) and the Don Valley project (UK). The Hontomin project (Spain) can be regarded as the third project, as it was developed as the research site for the Compostilla project in Spain; the Compostilla project, also a beneficiary of EEPR funds, was discontinued in 2013 after completing FEED studies. The Sleipner project joined the Network in 2011 and provided its experience and expertise to the EEPR funded projects. Together, the projects in the Network cover a wide range of storage options, from a depleted gas field to saline sandstone and carbonate formations. The ROAD project uses a compartment of an offshore depleted gas field, and the Don Valley project is developing an offshore saline aquifer. The Hontomin site, dedicated to research, uses an onshore carbonate reservoir. This paper gives an overview of the storage solutions developed or under development by these projects.

TI  - Aspects of the storage permit application for CO2 Storage in the depleted gas field offshore the Netherlands
AB  - The Rotterdam Capture and Storage Demonstration Project (ROAD, for `Rotterdam Opslag and Afvang Demonstratieproject') is a 250MWe equivalent carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration project being developed by E.ON and GDF SUEZ. The project receives funding from the EU as one of six selected projects within the EEPR funding scheme, the Dutch Government, and the Global CCS Institute. The post-combustion capture unit will be retrofitted to E.ON's coal-fired Maasvlakte Power Plant 3 (MPP3) and will capture ca. 90\% of the CO2 from approximately 25\% of the flue gas. On average 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 per year will be compressed, transported via a 25km insulated pipeline to the P18-A platform operated by TAQA, and permanently stored offshore in the P18-4 depleted gas reservoir. In the five year demonstration period a total amount of 5 million tonnes CO2 is envisaged to be stored. The project will be the first of its kind and is intended to demonstrate the economic, regulatory, and technical feasibility of Carbon Capture and Storage in a safe and responsible manner to reduce carbon emissions to the atmosphere. This paper discusses selected aspects of the permit application for CO2 storage in the P18-4 reservoir, filed for by TAQA to the Dutch ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation (EL\&I). The European Commission has stated its positive opinion towards the Dutch ministry EL\&I on the permit application and the draft storage permit {[}5]. Once a permit for CO2 storage is received, this project will be the first in Europe to hold a storage pen national implementation of the CCS-Directive 2009/31/EC {[}4] (C) 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Power systems analysis for unmanned offshore platform fed via a very long 13.8 kV submarine cable
AB  - One of Saudi Aramco's gas exploration expansion plans consists of powering an unmanned offshore platform via a 13.8 kV submarine cable. The closest available source substation (SS) is located onshore; approximately 107 km from the platform. Power systems analyses were conducted under various loading conditions. Upon starting the 11500 HP motor, at the onshore SS, severe system voltage drops were observed. This led to a problematic voltage fluctuation at the offshore platform. The installation of a 13.8 kV shunt capacitor bank (SCB) and shunt reactor bank (SRB) at the offshore platform were initially introduced to remedy voltage control. During transient analysis, under faulty conditions adjacent to the SCB, the 13.8 kV circuit breaker (CB) will be exposed to an excessive transient recovery voltage (TRV) exceeding the limit of the 13.8 kV CB. The harmonic analysis indicated high values on the 5th, 7th and 11th harmonic voltage distortion. As a mitigation measures, the segregation of motor loads and non-motor loads at the SS eliminated the severe voltage drop. The installation of a static synchronous shunt compensator (STATCOM) at the offshore platform was also retained as it will eliminate the need for an SCB and SRB with the high TRVs and resolve the harmonic problems.

TI  - Recoverable impacts of ocean acidification on the tubeworm, Hydroides elegans: implication for biofouling in future coastal oceans
AB  - Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 causes ocean acidification (OA), which not only decreases the calcification rate, but also impairs the formation of calcareous shells or tubes in marine invertebrates such as the dominant biofouling tubeworm species, Hydroides elegans. This study examined the ability of tubeworms to resume normal tube calcification when returned to ambient pH 8.1 from a projected near-future OA level of pH 7.8. Tubeworms produced structurally impaired and mechanically weaker calcareous tubes at pH 7.8 compared to at pH 8.1, but were able to recover when the pH was restored to ambient levels. This suggests that tubeworms can physiologically recover from the impacts of OA on tube calcification, composition, density, hardness and stiffness when returned to optimal conditions. These results help understanding of the progression of biofouling communities dominated by tubeworms in future oceans with low pH induced by OA.

TI  - Advances in predicting pipeline embedment based on assessment of field data
AB  - This paper reviews the current methodology for assessing pipeline embedment against field data, where embedment levels were under-predicted leading to an unconservative design. An updated model is provided for predicting pipeline embedment. One important principle behind this new approach is to define the operative soil strength, based on reconsolidation of the remoulded soil beneath the weight of the empty pipe during the intervening period between laying and flooding. This approach is based on pipeline embedment data from the field, which has demonstrated that soil around the pipe can become fully remoulded during installation. Therefore, embedment in the flooded condition should be assessed using an operative strength from reconsolidation, rather than the intact strength, which is current practice. This paper also provides current equations that improve the prediction of embedments over one-half diameter, by proposing methods to take account of the increasing buoyancy with depth, the reducing influence of heave mounds and modified penetration resistance at deeper embedments. Pipeline embedment is a fundamental input to the assessment of pipe-soil interaction, which is the largest uncertainty faced in the design of pipelines subject to lateral buckling and walking phenomena. However, pipeline embedment is notoriously difficult to predict due to the inherent uncertainty of the installation process. Improving the prediction of pipeline embedment is critical to reducing the range of predicted pipe-soil responses in design. A current project has compared high quality observations of pipeline embedment from an earlier phase of the same field development, against predicted embedments using more recent, high quality soils data from parallel pipeline routes, including fully remoulded soil strength from cyclic penetrometer testing. While current design approaches were under-predicting embedment levels, leading to a potentially unconservative design; this updated methodology provided a much-improved match to actual embedment data. The revised model was successfully verified against measured levels of pipeline embedment and is now being used for the design of future pipelines in the area, with improved certainty and easing of the design challenge. Under-predicting pipeline embedment could be critical to design integrity. The methodology presented in this paper has the potential to improve assessments of embedment and avoid unconservative pipe-soil responses on future developments.

TI  - Wax deposition and rheology: Progress and problems from an operator's view
AB  - The deposition and gelation of paraffins pose significant flow assurance risks, especially in offshore developments. Even though there have been numerous studies and breakthroughs in understanding the deposition and gelation phenomena over the years, there still continue to be some challenges that have remained unsolved. A primary issue is modeling deposition accurately in the turbulent flow regime. While some models/simulators are able to predict trends qualitatively, there isn't enough confidence in these predictions to reliably estimate deposition over the long term (order of 1 to 10 years). Another unresolved issue is the determination of the pressure required to restart a gelled pipeline. Various researchers have proposed different approaches, which are contradictory. As an example case, this paper focuses on a highly waxy crude oil with a WAT in the range of 125Â°F and pour point in the range of 90Â°F, and highlights some of the problems faced with the measurement techniques, the model development, and verification from an operator's perspective. The paper also describes some of the progress that has been made in these areas of late. Copyright 2010, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Simulation and motion analysis of deepwater manifold lifting
AB  - The development and utilization of oil and gas resources has expanded to deep water. The installation of a subsea manifold is crucial for developing offshore oil-gas fields. In this study, we used the lifting installation method (LIM) to install a subsea manifold. First, the appropriate environmental parameters were selected through the analysis of environmental loads at the Liwan 3-1 Gasfield in the South China Sea. The wind and wave spectra were selected using noise power density and Joint North Sea Wave Project spectra, respectively. The entire lifting and installation system that responds to environmental loads comprised a vessel, cable, and manifold. The time history of motion response was obtained through simulation and time-domain analysis for the entire lifting and installation process under the combined effect of wind, waves, and current. The motion response of the manifold and the cable tension were analyzed in three stages (entering, steady lowering, and landing phases). The results indicate that the motion responses of the vessel and manifold were highest in the direction of the environmental load. Moreover, the results indicated that the tension of the cable was highest during the entering phase. Furthermore, a heave compensation mechanism was used to reduce the vertical motion of the subsea manifold and the cable tension during the lifting process, which facilitated correct decision-making and reduced the risk of an accident.

TI  - The investigation of CO2 storage potential in the Zululand Basin in South Africa
AB  - As an emerging country, South Africa is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, resulting in significant CO2 emissions. As with all countries, South Africa will require a portfolio of technologies to reduce its CO2 emissions, with carbon capture and storage (CCS) likely to be a particularly important part of this portfolio. There is however, significant uncertainty around the technical potential of CCS in South Africa, as very little data are available for this technology, particularly with respect to CO2 storage. South Africa has no oil production and very little terrestrial gas production, and as a result there has been no substantial oil/gas exploration onshore since the 1970's. To better understand the technical potential of CCS in South Africa, as well as addressing the uncertainty around CO2 storage, the South African government, with the assistance from international governments and local and international industry, established the South African Centre of Carbon Capture and Storage (SACCCS). An Atlas on Geological Storage of Carbon Dioxide in South Africa (Atlas) was published in 2010, concluding that South Africa has 150 Gt of theoretical CO2 storage capacity, 98\% of which is offshore. The onshore storage capacity is split between the Algoa and Zululand sedimentary basins, with some additional storage potential in conjunction with enhanced coal bed methane. The Zululand basin forms a potential onshore target for CCS in South Africa, located on the east coast of South Africa in the northern KwaZulu-Natal Province. The basin represents an onshore extension of the southern Mozambique Basin, with basin-fill sediments of late Barremian to late Maastrichtian age. Basin-fill lithologies are subdivided into three formations, the Makatini, Mzinene and St Lucia Formations. Two sandstone packages of specific interest for CO2 storage have been identified with the lowermost Aptian-aged sandstone forming part of the Makatini Formation, and the upper Cenomanian to Turonian-aged sandstone occurring along the contact between the Mzinene and St Lucia Formations. The Aptian-age sandstone succession is identified at depths between 1200-1800 m extending over an area of similar to 1680 km(2). It occurs as a 100-250 m thick, interbedded succession of sandstone and siltstone, with subordinate claystone. Sandstone porosities range from 8-18\% but permeabilities are extremely low. The stratigraphically higher Cenomanian to Turonian-age sandstone succession is developed as a 20 to 200 m thick package of interbedded sandstone and siltstone, with similar to 30 m of laterally extensive, clean, gritty, quartz sandstone. The succession occurs at depths ranging from 900 m to <50 m with a consistent south-westward up-dip profile. Porosities range of 15-25\% with an average permeability of 229 mD. In 2013, SACCCS assembled the PCSP Advisory Committee (PAC) to provide external technical input and review to the development of the PCSP. For the first meeting of the PAC, they were asked, based on the basin-scale assessments of the Zululand and Algoa basins, to advise on the likelihood that SACCCS will be able to identify a site for the storage of 10-50,000t CO2. The PAC in their review report, complemented the depth of work done on the Zululand however recommended that more information could yet be extracted from the existing data prior to deciding whether or not to progress to the acquisition of new geological data, especially given the costs associated with such data acquisition. SACCCS is now working to address these recommendations and will make use of support committed from the World Bank for their completion. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Corrosion Protection Systems and Fatigue Corrosion in Offshore Wind Structures: Current Status and Future Perspectives
AB  - Concerns over reducing CO2 emissions associated with the burning of fossil fuels in combination with an increase in worldwide energy demands is leading to increased development of renewable energies such as wind. The installation of offshore wind power structures (OWS) is one of the most promising approaches for the production of renewable energy. However, corrosion and fatigue damage in marine and offshore environments are major causes of primary steel strength degradation in OWS. Corrosion can reduce the thickness of structural components which may lead towards fatigue crack initiation and buckling. These failure mechanisms affect tower service life and may result in catastrophic structural failure. Additionally, environmental pollution stemming from corrosion's by-products is possible. As a result, large financial investments are made yearly for both the prevention and recovery of these drawbacks. The corrosion rate of an OWS is dependent on different characteristics of attack which are influenced by access to oxygen and humidity. Structural degradation can occur due to chemical attack, abrasive action of waves, and microorganism attacks. Inspired by technological and scientific advances in recent years, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the current protective coating system technologies used to protect OWS as well as future perspectives.

TI  - Identifying Hydrogeochemical Conditions for Fault Self-Sealing in Geological CO2 Storage
AB  - Injection of anthropogenic CO2 into a subsurface reservoir will significantly impact the geochemistry, porosity, and permeability of the reservoir. If a fault or fracture penetrates the reservoir, CO2-enriched brine may migrate into that fault, eventually sealing it via precipitation or opening it up via dissolution. The goal of this study was to identify and quantify such conditions of fault self-sealing or self-enhancing. We found the Damkohler number (Da) provides a meaningful framework for characterizing the propensity of (fault) systems to seal or open up. We tailored a spatiotemporally varying Da framework and applied it to simplified fault models with eight conditions derived from four geologic compositions and two reservoir conditions. The four geologic compositions were chosen such that three of them were representative of distinct geologic end-members (sandstone, mudstone, and dolomitic limestone) and one was a mixed composition based on an average of three end-member compositions. The two sets of P-T conditions chosen included one for CO2 in a gaseous phase ({''}shallow conditions{''}) and the other for supercritical phase CO2 ({''}deep conditions{''}). Simulation results suggest that fault sealing via carbonate precipitation was a possibility for shallow conditions within limestone and mixed composition settings. The concentration of cations in the water was found to be an important control on the carbonate precipitation. A key conclusion suggested by the results of this study is that carbonate precipitation in the near-surface (top 50-100 m) depths of a fault is the most likely mechanism of ``self-sealing{''} for most geological settings.

TI  - Mobile bay project float-on deck installations
AB  - A float-on deck mating procedure was successfully used instead of a conventional derrick barge lift for installation of the integrated topsides on three production platforms. This procedure involved mooring the deck transportation barge inside a jacket/pile foundation and then ballasting the barge to mate the deck legs with the piles. The three platforms had topside weights ranging from 3700 to 4800 short tons. Two of the platforms were installed outside Mobile Bay in water depths of 40 and 46 feet and the third platform was installed inside the bay in 14 feet of water. This paper presents aspects of the structural designs and describes the installation procedures, mating hardware, and monitoring systems used to accomplish the float-on deck installations. Factors influencing the selection of this concept are also presented. Â© 1994, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Oceanic implications for climate change policy
AB  - Under the United Nations convention on the law of the sea (1982), each participating country maintains exclusive economic and environmental rights within the oceanic region extending 200 nm from its territorial sea, known as the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Although the ocean within each EEZ is undoubtedly an anthropogenic CO2 sink, it has been over-looked within international climate policy. In this paper I use an area-weighted scaling argument to show that the inclusion of the EEZ CO2 sink within national carbon accounts would have significant implications in tracking national greenhouse commitments to any future climate change policy initiative. The advantages and disadvantages for inclusion of the EEZ CO2 sink into global climate change policy are also explored. The most compelling argument for including the EEZ CO2 sink is that it would enhance the equity and resources among coastal nations to combat and adapt against future climate change that will inherently impact coastal nations more so than land locked nations. If included, the funds raised could be used for either monitoring or adaptive coastal infrastructure among the most vulnerable nations. On the other hand, the EEZ anthropogenic CO2 sink cannot be directly controlled by human activities and could be used as a disincentive for some developed nations to reduce fossil-fuel related greenhouse gas emissions. This may therefore dampen efforts to ultimately reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. In consideration of these arguments it is therefore suggested that an "EEZ clause" be added to Kyoto and any future international climate policy that explicitly excludes its use within national carbon accounts under these international climate frameworks.

TI  - The Analysis of Offshore Industry Transition - Acceleration from Oil \& Gas to Wind
AB  - The present paper provides an overview of the current state and future trends of the offshore sector worldwide, as well as the relationship between the oil and gas (O\&G) and the wind power industry offshore. Study on the offshore energy transition basis on review of literature, reports, and outlooks of main energy agencies, classification societies, and main offshore companies - their pathways and ambitions. A comparative analysis of the oil prices to their extraction at sea. Analysis of new build and scrapped drilling units, and their utilization. This is followed by correlation analysis between the emergence of new projects in O\&G and wind farms offshore. The new and cheaper technology, and ambitions to reduce greenhouse (GHG) emission to zero levels, favor renewable. The results disclose that the main O\&G companies start investing in renewable technologies. The offshore energy transition has already begun and accelerating. Nevertheless, full transition will take a while, as the global power demand is still too high to be covered only by a renewable source of energy. The number of annual O\&G assets decommissioning is double in size compared to the new projects, and Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) utilization average of 60\%. Offshore wind develops dynamically, and the forecasts show that this trend stands at the same high level to cross a number 100 GW produced from offshore wind globally in 2025, but there is a visible lack of Mobile Offshore Wind Power Service Operations Units (MOWU). If well planned there is room for mutual benefits between O\&G and wind within the offshore sector due to re-orientation measures.

TI  - Peatlands and plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia: Complex realities for resource governance, rural development and climate change mitigation
AB  - Peatlands play a crucial role in Indonesia's economic development, and in its stated goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Improved peatland management - including a national moratorium on the granting of any new conversion licenses - forms a cornerstone of Indonesia's climate change mitigation commitment. At the same time, rapid expansion of the plantation sector is driving wide-scale drainage and conversion of peat swamp ecosystems. The province of Riau, in central Sumatra, finds itself at the crossroads of these conflicting agendas. This essay presents a case study of three islands on Riau's east coast affected by industrial timber plantation concessions. It examines the divergent experiences, perceptions and responses of communities on the islands. A mix of dramatic protests, localised everyday actions and constructive dialogue has succeeded in delaying or perhaps halting one of the concessions, while negotiations and contestation with the other two continue. With the support of regional and national non-governmental organisations and local government, communities are pursuing alternative development strategies, including the cultivation of sago, which requires no peat drainage. While a powerful political economy of state and corporate actors shapes the contours of socio-environmental change, local social movements can alter trajectories of change, promoting incremental improvements and alternative pathways.

TI  - ITF report advises how shipping can meet, and exceed, the IMO's GHG target
AB  - The IMO has reached a deal for shipping companies to cut its carbon emissions by a minimum of 50% by 2050, compared with 2008 emissions. This deal has been criticized by some as watered-down, while others have pointed out this this minimum target is likely to be exceeded as technology required to meet it, and zero-carbon alternative fuels, will be significantly less polluting than the status quo if they are to be taken up across the industry. International Transport Forum's "Decarbonizing Marine Transport" report proposes the steps needed to almost entirely decarbonize shipping as early as 2035. The measures mentioned in the report are split into technological measures, operational measures, and alternative fuels/energy, with several specific examples considered for each. Furthermore, the report makes the three core recommendations which advise on the regulatory and financial conditions necessary to support decarbonization pathways, including setting a clear, ambitious emission reduction target to drive carbonization of maritime transport, supporting the realization of emissions reduction targets with a comprehensive set of policy measures, providing smart financial incentives to advance the decarbonization of maritime shipping. Lastly, the ITF report suggests a global carbon-pricing scheme, forcing optimal recourse allocation, and creating funds for green shipping research.

TI  - The response of nematodes to deep-sea CO2 sequestration: A quantile regression approach
AB  - One proposed approach to ameliorate the effects of global warming is sequestration of the greenhouse gas CO2 in the deep sea. To evaluate the environmental impact of this approach, we exposed the sediment-dwelling fauna at the mouth of the Monterey Submarine Canyon (3262 m) and a site on the nearby continental rise (3607 m) to CO2-rich water. We measured meiobenthic nematode population and community metrics after âˆ¼30-day exposures along a distance gradient from the CO2 source and with sediment depth to infer the patterns of mortality. We also compared the nematode response with that of harpacticoid copepods. Nematode abundance, average sediment depth, tail-group composition, and length: width ratio did not vary with distance from the CO2 source. However, quantile regression showed that nematode length and diameter increased in close proximity to the CO2 source in both experiments. Further, the effects of CO2 exposure and sediment depth (nematodes became more slender at one site, but larger at the other, with increasing depth in the sediment) varied with body size. For example, the response of the longest nematodes differed from those of average length. We propose that nematode body length and diameter increases were induced by lethal exposure to CO2-rich water and that nematodes experienced a high rate of mortality in both experiments. In contrast, copepods experienced high mortality rates in only one experiment suggesting that CO2 sequestration effects are taxon specific. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Using seawater-based Na2CO3 medium for scrubbing the CO2 released from Bio-CNG plant for enhanced biomass production of Pseudanabaena limnetica
AB  - The concentration of CO2, one of the most important greenhouse gases (GHG), has reached to 409.8 Â± 0.1Â ppm in 2019. Although there are many carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods, they are very costly and their long term use raises concern about environmental safety. Alternatively, bio-sequestration of CO2 using microalgal cell factories has emerged as a promising way of recycling CO2 into biomass via photosynthesis. In the present study, Indigenous algal strain Pseudanabaena limnetica was cultivated in pneumatically agitated 60-L flat-panel photobioreactor system. The gas was released from Bio-CNG plant as by-product into Na2CO3-rich medium and cultivated in semicontinuous mode of operation. It was observed that when CO2 was sparged in seawater-based 0.02Â M Na2CO3 solution, maximum CO2 was dissolved in the system and was used for algal cultivation. Control system produced 0.64 Â± 0.035Â g/L of biomass at the end of 15Â days, whereas CO2 sparged Na2CO3 medium produced 0.81 Â± 0.046Â g/L of biomass. When CO2 from Bio-CNG station was fed, it resulted in biomass production of 1.62 Â± 0.070Â g/L at the end of 18Â days compared to 1.46 Â± 0.066Â g/L of biomass produced in control system which was not fed with gas released from Bio-CNG plant as by-product. Thus, feeding CO2 directly into Na2CO3 medium and operating the system semicontinuously would be efficient for scrubbing CO2 from commercial Bio-CNG plant. This study proves that feeding CO2 gas from Bio-CNG plant into Na2CO3-rich alkaline system can be used to feed algae for enhanced biomass production. Â© 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Numerical analysis of economic and environmental benefits of marine fuel conversion from diesel oil to natural gas for container ships
AB  - Shipping is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions. These emissions mainly come from using diesel fuel for power generation. In this paper, the natural gas is proposed as an alternative marine fuel to be used instead of conventional marine diesel oil. Numerical analysis of environmental and economic benefits of the natural gas-diesel dual-fuel engine is carried out. As a case study, a container ship of class A7 owned by Hapag-Lloyd has been investigated. The results show that the proposed dual-fuel engine achieves environmental benefits for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), particulate matter (PM), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions by 20.1%, 85.5%, 98%, 99%, and 55.7% with cost effectiveness of 109, 840, 9864, 27761, and 4307Â US$/ton, respectively. The results show that the conversion process to the dual-fuel engine will comply with the current and future IMO regulations regarding air pollutant emissions. On the other hand, using the proposed dual-fuel engine on the container ship will improve the ship energy efficiency index by 29.6 % with annual fuel cost saving of 4.77 million US dollars.

TI  - A semi-recirculating, integrated system for the culture of fish and seaweed
AB  - Biofiltration allows for environmentally sustainable mariculture. An intensive, biofiltered recirculating integrated system producing fish and seaweed on a semi-commercial scale was evaluated with respect to production and to nutrient and heat budgets. The system consisted of abalone (Haliotis discus hannai) and sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) tanks, an intensive fishpond (Sparus aurata), and a three-stage Ulva lactuca biofilter, which cleaned and recirculated 50% of the effluent back to the fishpond. To preserve water heat, the shellfish and fishpond units were both covered with greenhouses; the biofilter unit was covered with a greenhouse only during winter. Seaweed yield was variable and averaged 94 and 117 g m-2 day-1 (fresh weight) in periods with and without greenhouse cover, respectively. Protein content of U. lactuca averaged above 34% of dry weight. The biofiltration of only 50% of the water through the seaweed biofilter reduced the export of dissolved nutrients to the environment by nearly 30%. Peak ammonia excretion by the morning-fed fish coincided with maximum seaweed light-dependent ammonia uptake and concentrations of ammonia in the fishpond remained within nontoxic limits. Also, daytime photosynthesis of U. lactuca (uptake of CO2) met fish respiration (production of CO2), thus balancing fishpond pH levels within safe limits regarding ammonia toxicity. Daytime oxygen demand by the fish was partially met by the photosynthetically generated oxygen. Before covering the biofilter with a greenhouse, it lost much heat, reducing the temperature in the fishpond. Following the greenhouse covering of the biofilter, heat loss ceased and consequently the fishpond temperature was raised. Recirculation through the biofilter improved system sustainability; it reduced water use, lowered negative environmental impact, and maintained stable and safe water quality conditions in the fishpond.

TI  - New grades of high strength steel for offshore mooring chains: R5S 1100 MPa and R6 1200 MPa
AB  - This paper is focused on the definition of two new grades of high strength steel for offshore mooring chains providing increased strength and reduced weight for a given size. The new grades are identified as: Â° R5S, with an ultimate tensile strength of 1100 MPa. Â° R6, with an ultimate tensile strength of 1200 MPa. Both grades should be considered as new solutions for those offshore applications in which the mooring has shown to be risky, technologically challenging and capital intensive, such as deepwater exploration and production, wind power or locations where in-service metocean conditions could exceed the design ones. Recognising these challenges as opportunities to develop an appropriate solution, the grades R5S and R6 have been designed, used for chain manufacturing and characterized with standard mechanical tests, fracture mechanics, fatigue and hydrogen embrittlement, so as to ensure their suitability for those offshore opportunities.

TI  - Design of a recovery system for the SV3 wave glider
AB  - The Sensor Hosting Autonomous and Remote Craft (SHARC) Wave Glider is an autonomous, surface vehicle (USV) used to collect and deliver real-time data in remote ocean locations around the world. Liquid Robotics Inc. (LRI) manufactures the Wave Glider for the defense, maritime surveillance, environmental assessment, and oil and gas industries. It is powered by wave energy and supplemented by solar energy using solar panels; no extra fuel is needed between voyages that may last up to a year. The Wave Glider consists of a platform float, submerged propulsor (glider or sub), and optional towed payload. The float and sub are connected by an umbilical tether. The launch and deployment process of the Wave Glider is relatively easy; however the recovery is more difficult and is associated with a high risk to the safety of the operators and the condition of the equipment. This project reviews a U.S. Navy-sponsored project to develop, test, and recommend a new recovery system according to specific design criteria. The project team consisted of five undergraduate ocean engineering students and three faculty advisers from the U.S. Naval Academy. Design alternatives were analyzed as separate parts: (1) to capture and lift the sub onto the recovery vessel and (2) to capture and lift the float on the recovery vessel. A proof-of-concept design included the use of a remotely operated lift bag system which was designed, manufactured, and installed on the sub to stop movement. Overall the design, manufacture, and testing of the proof-of-concept recovery system was successful. Â© 2017 Marine Technology Society.

TI  - Optimal Investment and Flexible Operation of Power-to-Hydrogen Systems Increasing Wind Power Utilisation
AB  - One of the biggest challenges today is how net-zero carbon emission pathways for the industry will evolve by 2050. The solution space includes heavy utilisation of renewables for the electrification of industrial processes and the use of renewable molecules. It is expected that more than 200 GW of offshore wind power will be installed in the North Sea region by 2050, which necessitates the need for bulk power transport together with storage facilities. Hydrogen production and storage systems can help balance the electricity grid and facilitate the maximum utilisation of offshore wind energy. Such systems also will affect the expansion requirements of electricity grids by reducing wind power curtailments and employing the existing natural gas network and hydrogen pipelines. This research investigates the optimal operation of a coupled wind-hydrogen system, which supplies green hydrogen to the industrial sites and injects it into the natural gas grid. The produced hydrogen can be utilised as a long-term storage medium for electricity generation as well. Moreover, in order to maximise the total annual profits and renewable energy utilisation ratio, the optimal design of the hydrogen system is studied by using historical data from the Belgian energy markets. The preliminary results show that net power curtailment can be reduced up to 63% by making use of the excess energy to produce hydrogen. Â© 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Rates and fluxes of centennial-scale carbon storage in the fine-grained sediments from the central South Yellow Sea and Min-Zhe belt, East China Sea
AB  - The global carbon cycle has played a key role in mitigating global warming and climate change. Long-term natural and anthropogenic processes influence the composition, sources, burial rates, and fluxes of carbon in sediments on the continental shelf of China. In this study, the rates, fluxes, and amounts of carbon storage at the centennial scale were estimated and demonstrated using the case study of three fine-grained sediment cores from the central South Yellow Sea area (SYSA) and Min-Zhe belt (MZB), East China Sea. Based on the high-resolution temporal sequences of total carbon (TC) and total organic carbon (TOC) contents, we reconstructed the annual variations of historical marine carbon storage, and explored the influence of terrestrial and marine sources on carbon burial at the centennial scale. The estimated TC storage over 100 years was 1.18x10(8) t in the SYSA and 1.45x10(9) t in the MZB. The corrected TOC storage fluxes at the centennial scale ranged from 17 to 28 t/(km(2)center dot a)in the SYSA and from 56 to 148 t/(km(2)center dot a) in the MZB. The decrease of terrestrial materials and the increase of marine primary production suggest that the TOC buried in the sediments in the SYSA and MZB was mainly derived from the marine autogenetic source. In the MZB, two depletion events occurred in TC and TOC storage from 1985 to 1987 and 2003 to 2006, which were coeval with the water impoundment in the Gezhouba and Three Gorges dams, respectively. The high-resolution records of the carbon storage rates and fluxes in the SYSA and MZB reflect the synchronous responses to human activities and provide an important reference for assessing the carbon sequestration capacity of the marginal seas of China.

TI  - EBH-DBR: energy-balanced hybrid depth-based routing protocol for underwater wireless sensor networks
AB  - Recently, applications of underwater wireless sensor networks like environment monitoring, underwater life imaging, tactical surveillance, ocean floor monitoring demand a persistent network period. However, underwater wireless sensor networks face many design challenges like unreliable link, high packet drop rate, inadequate bandwidth, restricted battery power, high attenuation, etc. Therefore, to prolong the network lifespan, energy efficient as well as energy balanced both types of approach is equally demanded. An energy-balanced hybrid transmission approach is proposed in this article, which uses depth information in place of location to transmit data packets. It uses some parameters like depth of the sensor nodes, residual energy of the node, and reliability of the link to select the relay node to forward data packets. In the proposal network divided into the slices of the same width, to control the hop-count as well as to balance the energy consumption of the sensor nodes participating in data transmission, and also prolonging the network lifespan. The effectiveness of the proposal is validated through extensive simulation and results show that the EBH-DBR outperforms its counterpart techniques in terms of network lifespan, energy consumption, throughput, and transmission loss.

TI  - Aquatic food webs in mangrove and seagrass habitats of Centla Wetland, a Biosphere Reserve in Southeastern Mexico
AB  - Mangrove and seagrass habitats are important components of tropical coastal zones worldwide, and are conspicuous habitats of Centla Wetland Biosphere Reserve (CWBR) in Tabasco, Mexico. In this study, we examine food webs in mangrove-and seagrass-dominated habitats of CWBR using stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen. Our objective was to identify the importance of carbon derived from mangroves and seagrasses to secondary production of aquatic consumers in this poorly studied conservation area. Carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of basal sources and aquatic consumers indicated that the species-rich food webs of both habitats are dependent on riparian production sources. The abundant Red mangrove Rhizophora mangle appears to be a primary source of carbon for the mangrove creek food web. Even though dense seagrass beds were ubiquitous, most consumers in the lagoon food web appeared to rely on carbon derived from riparian vegetation (e.g. Phragmites australis). The introduced Amazon sailfin catfish Pterygoplichthys pardalis had isotope signatures overlapping with native species (including high-value fisheries species), suggesting potential competition for resources. Future research should examine the role played by terrestrial insects in linking riparian and aquatic food webs, and impacts of the expanding P. pardalis population on ecosystem function and fisheries in CWBR. Our findings can be used as a baseline to reinforce the conservation and management of this important reserve in the face of diverse external and internal human impacts.

TI  - The sustainable city
AB  - The world's climate is changing. The scientific evidence is incontrovertible: most of this change is due to human activity, and the process is speeding up as more and more carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases are pumped into the atmosphere. The next decades are critical. Carbon dioxide emissions must be cut rapidly. If they are, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we may limit the rise in global temperatures to two degrees centigrade. This could trigger mass extinction of many plants and animals, a complete loss of ice sheets, rising sea levels and significantly altered weather patterns. There is no luxury of time. As more and more of the world's population crowds into cities, the urban environment needs to become a better place to live: a place that improves health, well-being and economic prosperity while simultaneously and dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The plans are about more than protecting the environment; they also provide maintenance or better level of services with reduced resources and budgets; help citizens save money and increase the quality of life. Sustainable development means that contractors, designers and real estate developers aim to create buildings and communities that minimize the depletion of natural resources and use renewable resources so as not to compromise for future generations. Sustainable development practices emphasize efficient use of resources such as energy, water and building materials. The practice addresses building sitting, design, construction practices, construction materials, operation, maintenance and removal. It also includes an emphasis on renewable resources generated from sustainable sources, including solar power, hydroelectricity, wind generators and harnessing the earth's geothermal sources to generate energy. A sustainable city is one that practices sustainable methods and works with citizens and neighboring communities to integrate sustainable practices into daily life. Â© 2010 IEEE.

TI  - Energy scenarios for Malta (vol 33, pg 4235, 2008)
AB  - Many island power systems are powered by diesel generators or long underwater cables, which result in greater operating costs or losses than stand-alone systems. It is therefore desirable to integrate renewable energy (RE) sources into these mini grids. The main objective of the paper is to describe, analyse and present a more unified approach for assessing the technical feasibility/potential of different energy scenarios for the islands of Malta. in this study, three different scenarios are analysed. Integrating RE sources (RES) in energy systems reduces losses, cuts fossil fuel consumption whilst maintaining system stability and increasing job opportunities. Hydrogen conversion and storage methods are also analysed as a method for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction in the transport sector and as a way to reduce excess electricity produced from RE.

TI  - Innovative vertical slotted wave barriers for reducing wave reflection of relatively long gravity waves
AB  - Long gravity waves entering into port and harbors create much higher wave agitation. It is required to dissipate this wave energy for safe loading and unloading operation. Sloped rubble mound breakwater is used normally. But it occupies significant space of the harbor. In order to improve the wave dissipation performance, experimental investigations were carried out on vertical slotted wave barriers. The number of barriers was varied from 1 to 6 and the porosity from 10% to 50%. Wave reflection is measured for a wide range of random waves, specifically focused on long waves. It is found that for relatively long waves, reflection coefficient of 0.27 can be achieved with 6 units of slotted walls with 40% porosity when compared to 0.57 for conventional slopped rubble mound breakwaters. The material required for the construction of this slotted wave barrier is only about 14% when compared to the conventional rubble barrier.

TI  - Sulfur recovery processes modified for FPSO topside installations
AB  - As environmental pressures increase, and interest grows in developing evermore-sour offshore oil fields, FPSO operators will be required to recover sulfur from associated gas to control hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and/or sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions to the air. The first liquid redox process unit for removing sulfur from associated gas to be used to fuel FPSO topsides is under design, and smaller scavenger systems are also available for use on remote floating platforms. This paper details the economics of options for recovering sulfur from associated gas. The challenges of modifying onshore process designs of these technologies for use in floating offshore facilities is also discussed. In onshore applications, regenerable sulfur recovery processes offer order-of-magnitude lower operating costs than scavenger systems. Onshore, these operating cost savings can justify the higher capital costs associated with regenerable technology when dealing with sulfur loads as low as 200 kilograms per day; and liquid redox processes have additional advantages over scavenger systems when evaluated for use in remote floating facilities. Operability in limited space, and greatly reduced logistical demands, decrease the sulfur production breakpoint whereupon regenerable systems show advantages over non-regenerable systems. As pressure increases for FPSO designers and operators to provide solutions to sulfur emission problems, the correct choice of processing options will minimize the cost and the operating burdens associated with these new facilities.

TI  - Connecting the dots: Policy connections between Pacific Island shipping and global CO2 and pollutant emission reduction
AB  - The relationships between the global discourse on emissions reduction, particularly in regard to international shipping, and the need for more sustainable Pacific Island sea transport services are discussed. Renewable energy applications for such shipping are not currently considered in the drive to reduce fossil fuel dependency in the region. The domestic Pacific Island shipping scenario and international shipping and emissions reduction efforts are summarized. Data availability is limited; however, the authors extrapolate from Fiji data to give a 'best guess' of the likely range of emissions produced by the Pacific Island shipping and argue that reduction targets are achievable based on results of experiments in the last oil crisis. Five policy areas are identified that connect the local need with the global discourse and give rise to the promotion of sustainable, low-carbon maritime transport for this unique region.

TI  - Optimization of liner route allocation considering carbon emissions
AB  - With the general awareness of energy and environmental issues in the whole society, the issue of greenhouse gas emission reduction has gradually become the focus of attention. Ocean transport undertakes more than 90% of the world's cargo transportation and also produces a large amount of carbon dioxide. In order to achieve carbon emission reduction in the shipping industry, in June 2012, the ECOFIN proposed to impose a Maritime Carbon Tax, which will increase the operating costs of shipping companies. In view of this, it is of great significance to consider carbon emission factors in the optimization of liner routes. This paper considers the carbon emissions of maritime transportation, establishes a mathematical model that minimizes operating costs such as maritime carbon tax, ship management fees, and fuel costs, verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm through calculation examples, and provides a plan for the carrier to make optimization decisions on liner route allocation.

TI  - Innovative Artificial Agro-Ecosystems Enhance Soil Carbon Sequestration in Coastal Zones of Southeast China
AB  - Tidal flats, which are important reserved land resources, have a vital role in climate change. To evaluate the contribution of coastal saline soils to carbon sequestration, field tests were performed over a 3 year period at the Dafeng Wanggang Experimental Station in Jiangsu Province, China. Six artificial agro-ecosystems, including wasteland (WL), freshwater fish culture (FC), Sesbania culture (SC), barley culture (BC), mixed culture of fish and Sesbania (MCFS) and mixed culture of fish and barley (MCFB), were established according to developmental processes of coastal saline soils. At the initial stage of tidal flat reclamation, the soil organic carbon (SOC) increased by 59.4tha-1 in the FC system during 3 years, which was much higher than that of the WL system (40.7tha-1). When the tidal flats evolved into high saline soils, the MCFS system sequestered SOC more effectively than the FC or SC systems with increases of 53.1, 16.9 and 8.3tha-1, respectively. Subsequently, in the low saline soils, the maximum soil carbon sequestration was obtained in the MCFB system (35.8tha-1) followed by the BC (17.5tha-1) and FC (13.5tha-1) systems. Therefore, proper development of tidal flats to farmland and the subsequent establishment of optimised artificial agro-ecosystems make an important contribution to carbon sequestration and climate changes in coastal areas.

TI  - Pipe joint management for risers and pipelines
AB  - Minimizing the stress concentration factor (SCF) in pipe joint welding subjected to fatigue is a major concern. Machining the joint ends is one way to achieve this. However, this adds cost, time, risk of potential crack starters, and loss of wall thickness which is detrimental for fatigue, strength, and engineering criticality assessment (ECA) in particular. Pipe joint sorting (certain joints in sequence) and end matching (rotating the pipe joints for best fit) are other ways. However, this adds time, costly logistics, risk of errors, and does not guarantee the minimum possible SCF is achieved. In a typical project, more pipe joints are procured than required in order to mitigate contingencies. For pipelines, this overage is typically a percentage of the required number of joints or pipeline length. For risers, typically double the required number of joints is procured where half of the joints is sent offshore for installation and the remaining half is kept onshore for a spare riser. Then, it becomes very important to send for installation the best pipe joints that produce the best (lowest) SCFs out of the entire batch of pipe joints. This requires calculating the SCF for every potential match of any random joints to be welded together, and then choosing the best joints. Performing such calculations by spreadsheet is not feasible considering the tremendous number of required iterations and calculations. A pipe joint management software development is presented herein which accomplishes this task and examples provided to illustrate the benefits. Note: Selecting pipe joints with the best end measurements, whether ID, OD, OOR, or thickness does not guarantee that the minimum possible SCFs will be achieved since the SCF is a function of all those measurements.

TI  - Geometry optimization of centre bulb to reduce wave resistance on catamaran ship
AB  - A catamaran is a ship with two identical hull forms, which on this type of vessel it has interferences in between its hulls. These interferences cause resistance and a popular topic to research. Multiple factors can cause these interferences, such as the wrong approach to design the hull forms and to set the distance between hulls. On reducing the resistance, there are different approaches that can be used, such as designing streamline demi-hull, adding the bulbous bow, or installing the center bulb. The concept of center bulb itself is considered as a new idea on how to reduce the ship's resistance. Unfortunately, this idea is less explored and needs further research. Thus, this research is trying to use the ellipsoidal shaped center bulb to reduce the wave resistance on a catamaran. The objective is to find the optimum geometry size of length (X1) and diameter (X2) by using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). In this term, the optimum center bulb model can reduce the wave resistance of the catamaran significantly. The result regression formula from Order I is Rw=0.3358X1+0.3969X2+14.5509 and from Order II Rw=-0.061X1+0.096X2+0.373X12+0.430X22+0.329X1X2. The optimal model of the center bulb can reduce the wave resistance by 11.11% compared to catamaran without an optimized center bulb. Additionally, it can cut down by 5.36% compared to catamaran without a center bulb. Â© 2019: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.

TI  - Na kika completions overview: Challenges and accomplishments
AB  - The Na Kika project is a world-class development of a set of reservoirs dispersed across multiple lease blocks in the ultra deep water Gulf of Mexico. The ten subsea well completions represent a model of technological innovation combined with an efficient execution process that set multiple records for well completions in any water depth. This paper provides an overview of the Na Kika completions campaign, conducted over a nine month period from June 2002 to February 2003 from the Transocean Sedco-Forex MODU Marianas. The economic development of the dispersed, small to medium sized fields at Na Kika, was strongly enabled by novel approaches to subsea production system and well completion design. In addition to the technical challenges inherent in this project, sound project management and contingency planning practices were critical to assuring success given the need to align completion, subsea, and host facility installation activities while delivering on-time and on-budget. The project team overcame numerous execution challenges, including aggressive cost and schedule expectations and extensive application of new technologies, to complete execution in just over half of the projected time, without significant incident, and within budget expectations. The Na Kika wells were some of the most complex and technically challenging ever installed in an offshore environment, combining 18 discrete reservoir packages into 10 well completions. Well types varied from single zone Frac Packs to triple zone intelligent wells and horizontal open hole gravel packs. Integration of rig and installation vessel activities realized synergies that contributed significantly to the record-breaking pace. Well quality indicators recorded during completion activities indicate that nearly all completion inflow and sand control expectations should be met. Copyright 2004, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Impacts of urban carbon dioxide emissions on sea-air flux and ocean acidification in nearshore waters
AB  - Greatly enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels relative to well-mixed marine air are observed during periods of offshore winds at coastal sensor platforms in Monterey Bay, California, USA. The highest concentrations originate from urban and agricultural areas, are driven by diurnal winds, and peak in the early morning. These enhanced atmospheric levels can be detected across a similar to 100km wide nearshore area and represent a significant addition to total oceanic CO2 uptake. A global estimate puts the added sea-air flux of CO2 from these greatly enhanced atmospheric CO2 levels at 25 million tonnes, roughly 1\% of the ocean's annual CO2 uptake. The increased uptake over the 100 km coastal swath is of order 20\%, indicating a potentially large impact on ocean acidification in productive coastal waters.

TI  - Review of oil palm-derived activated carbon for CO2 capture
AB  - Increasing ambient carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission has contributed to the growing rate of global land and ocean surface temperature. Various carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies were established to mitigate this impending issue. CO2 adsorption is gaining prominence since unlike traditional chemical absorption, it does not require high energy usage for solvent regeneration and consumption of corrosive chemical solvent. In CO2 adsorption, activated carbons show high CO2 adsorption capacity given their well-developed porous structures. Numerous researches employed oil palm wastes as low-cost precursors. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of research works available thus far in oil palm-derived activated carbon (OPdAC) for CO2 adsorption application. First, we present the desired OPdAC characteristics and its precursors in terms of their chemical properties, elemental, and proximate compositions. This is followed by an overview of various activation methodologies and surface modification methods to attain the desired characteristics for CO2 adsorption. Then the focus turned to present available OPdAC CO2 adsorption performance and how it is affected by its physical and chemical characteristics. Based on these, we identify the challenges and the potential development in different aspects such as precursor selection, process development, and optimization of parameter. A pilot scale production cost analysis is also presented to compare various activation and surface modification methods, so that the appropriate method can be selected for CO2 adsorption.

TI  - A Novel DC Transmission System Fault Location Technique for Offshore Renewable Energy Harvesting
AB  - Advances in renewable energy recourses technologies have paved the way for increased utilization of DC grids in modern power systems. In particular, high voltage DC (HVDC) transmission cables are used to harvest offshore energy. Since failure diagnosis and repair of the buried offshore cables under the sea bed involve quite laborious tasks, accurate fault location is of vital importance. This paper proposes a novel fault location method based on the synchronized measurement of conductors and sheaths currents in each terminal without requiring the voltage signal. Unlike the traveling-wave-based methods, the proposed method is developed for multi-terminal HVDC systems without requiring any high precision measurement infrastructure. The proposed method can be implemented for different system topologies as well as fault resistance and fault distance. The fault location method can provide accurate results even if 10 ms time window samples are imported into the proposed algorithm. In addition, accuracy of the fault location using the proposed method is not affected significantly by noisy condition. Different test systems have been simulated to evaluate performance of the proposed method in various scenarios. Obtained results confirm that the proposed practical method can provide the accurate fault location for all different scenarios and conditions. Â© 1986-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Low-carbon GeoEnergy resource options in the Midland Valley of Scotland, UK
AB  - Scotland is committed to be a carbon-neutral society by 2040 and has achieved the important initial step of decarbonizing power production. However, more ambitious measures are required to fully decarbonize all of the electricity, transport and heating sectors. We explore the potential to use low-carbon GeoEnergy resources and bioenergy combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in the Midland Valley area to decarbonize the Scottish economy and society. The Midland Valley has a long history of geological resource extraction and, as a result, the geology of the region is well characterized. Geothermal energy and subsurface energy storage have the potential to be implemented. Some of them, such as gravity and heat storage, could re-use the redundant mining infrastructure to decrease investment costs. Hydrogen storage could be of particular interest as the Midland Valley offers the required caprock-reservoir assemblages. BECCS is also a promising option to reduce overall CO2 emissions by between 1.10 and 4.40 MtCO(2) a(-1). The Midland Valley has enough space to grow the necessary crops, but CO2 storage will most likely be implemented in North Sea saline aquifers. The studied aspects suggest that the Midland Valley represents a viable option in Scotland for the exploitation of the majority of low-carbon GeoEnergy resources.

TI  - Space@Sea the Floating Solution
AB  - This paper describes the Horizon 2020 project Space@Sea (www.spaceatseaproject.eu) which started in November 2017. This project aims to provide a concept of affordable and flexible floating islands. With increasing population and rising sea level there is a scarcity for space on land for the people to live, grow food and harvest renewable energy. Moreover, a large number of people live in areas that are exposed to the risk of flooding in case of sea level rise. These trends call for a solution at sea that creates a new perspective. Previous projects on floating habitation such as the TROPOS project (www.Troposplatform.eu) have delivered artist impressions. Technical solutions are yet to be provided. In the Space@Sea project a conceptual study is done to develop a standardized floating solution for offshore space. Four applications focusing on energy hub, living, aquaculture and maritime transport will be demonstrated. For two locations a business case of a combination of these applications will be examined. The present paper discusses the Space@Sea project background and approach of the collaborative research. First results regarding the basic design and societal acceptance are discussed at a high level. Throughout the Space@Sea project results will be published on Frontiers in Marine Science.

TI  - Hydrodynamic characteristics and mass transfer performance of rotating packed bed for CO2 removal by chemical absorption: A review
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) removal is an important process in natural gas processing. For offshore natural gas, due to the space limitations of offshore platforms, the volume requirement of CO2 removal equipment is very strict. Therefore, high-efficient CO2 removal equipment is needed to meet the processing requirements of natural gas. As a new type of process intensification technology, the rotating packed bed (RPB) is a desirable candidate for removing CO2 from offshore natural gas due to its good mass transfer performance and considerable size savings. In this paper, the research progress of RPBs is reviewed from the aspects of hydrodynamic characteristics and mass transfer performance. Different research methods have been discussed, and their advantages and disadvantages have been pointed out. The factors that affect the efficiency of CO2 removal have been analyzed, and operational recommendations have been given. Suggestions for future research are put forward to promote the application of RPBs on offshore platforms for CO2 removal from offshore natural gas. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - H-POWER FACILITY EXPANSION
AB  - The City and County of Honolulu on the Island of Oahu in the Hawaiian chain has been taking steps to reduce the need for landfilling and to continue to be self-sufficient for waste disposal. For an island, having the capacity to process all of its waste is crucial and producing power helps reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The City and County relies upon its waste-to-energy facility to manage the waste stream. The existing H-POWER Waste-to-Energy (WTE) Facility, which has been in operation for about twenty years, is a 2,000 ton-per-day (tpd) refuse derived fuel (RDF) two-unit plant with a single condensing steam turbine generator. Recent actions to enhance and expand the H-POWER Facility have been undertaken to ensure the needs to the island will be met for the foreseeable future. Enhancements and an expansion of the existing H-POWER Facility have begun and are well into construction. The enhancements will improve environmental performance and reliability and the expansion will add nearly fifty percent to the facility capacity. When complete, the expanded facility will have a number of unique features that will improve its ability to manage more types of municipal solid waste. The facility expansion will utilize mass burn technology in a single 900 tpd combustion unit with an associated turbine generator. The expansion unit will feature fabric filters for particulate control and state-of-the-art Covanta Very Low NOx (VLN (TM)) technology intended to reduce NOx emissions well below that achieved with conventional selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) used at many other WTE plants in the USA. Independent of the expansion, the existing facility has been retrofitted with new fabric filters and induced-draft fans, which offer greater particulate and heavy metal control and improve control of other emissions. The existing facility is also getting much-needed improvements to boost reliability for many years to come. When the expansion comes on line, the facility will reliably generate about 7 percent of the island's electrical power as opposed to 5 percent from the current 2,000 tpd of waste processed. This paper explores progress to date on the revitalization of the H-POWER Facility and its expansion.

TI  - Countering the broadleaf invasion: Financial and carbon consequences of removing hardwoods during longleaf pine savanna restoration
AB  - The once widespread Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)-dominated ecosystems of the southeastern coastal plain of the United States have been greatly reduced in extent, and many of the remaining stands are being degraded by hardwood invasion due to fire suppression. The first step toward pine savanna restoration is often hardwood removal, a costly process due to their large volumes and low market values. Despite these problems, by marketing a wide range of hard- and softwood products, the costs of 13 restoration projects in northern Florida were substantially reduced. Ten different products were sold to 19 different buyers. Fuel chips represented 71-100% of all biomass removed (8.2-81.1 Mg/ha). Although landowners were charged modest amounts for removing biomass harvested as fuel chips, other marketed products yielded revenues. Overall, four projects earned net profits of $29-$383/ha, and four projects generated sufficient revenue to pay 17-99% of the cost of hardwood removal as fuel chips. A carbon accounting of a second set of projects demonstrated that carbon harvested as fuel chips far exceeded that consumed in harvest and transport, yielding net carbon offsets of 451-1,320 Mg C/project (3.3-13.9 Mg C/ha). Using fuel consumption results of this second set of projects, carbon offsets for the 13 restoration projects were estimated as 89-1,524 Mg (3.8-37.9 Mg C/ha). Restorationists should monitor traditional forest product markets as well as developing carbon markets for price fluctuations that could provide significant revenues to restoration projects.

TI  - Sea ice contribution to the air-sea CO2 exchange in the Arctic and Southern Oceans
AB  - Although salt rejection from sea ice is a key process in deep-water formation in ice-covered seas, the concurrent rejection of CO2 and the subsequent effect on air-sea CO2 exchange have received little attention. We review the mechanisms by which sea ice directly and indirectly controls the air-sea CO2 exchange and use recent measurements of inorganic carbon compounds in bulk sea ice to estimate that oceanic CO2 uptake during the seasonal cycle of sea-ice growth and decay in ice-covered oceanic regions equals almost half of the net atmospheric CO2 uptake in ice-free polar seas. This sea-ice driven CO2 uptake has not been considered so far in estimates of global oceanic CO2 uptake. Net CO2 uptake in sea-ice-covered oceans can be driven by; (1) rejection during sea-ice formation and sinking of CO2-rich brine into intermediate and abyssal oceanic water masses, (2) blocking of air-sea CO2 exchange during winter, and (3) release of CO2-depleted melt water with excess total alkalinity during sea-ice decay and (4) biological CO2 drawdown during primary production in sea ice and surface oceanic waters.

TI  - A model of factors influencing deck officersâ€™ cyber risk perception in offshore operations
AB  - Offshore operations onboard vessels are increasingly reliant on digitalization, integration, automation, and networked-based systems, which creates new dimensions of cyber risks. The causes of cyber incidents often include complex relationships between humans and technology, and in offshore operations, the onboard crew can be both a cyber security risk and a vital resource in strengthening the cyber security. This makes the behaviour of the decisionmakers onboard important in both preventing and handling cyber risks at sea. By use of in-depth interviews and the constant comparative analysis (CCA), this paper investigates factors influencing deck officersâ€™ cyber risk perception in offshore operations and presents a contextual model of these factors. The model indicates that deck officersâ€™ cyber risk perception can be affected by a feeling of distance towards cyber risks, being more restricted in their working environment because of digitalization, and trust in their reliable cyber-physical systems and suppliers. Further, targeted cyber risk mitigation measures should be implemented on multiple levels in shipping companies. The measures may benefit from focusing on increased risk communication, operational training, awareness campaigns, vessel-specific procedures, and policies, in addition to increased communication from management regarding the demand for digitalization. With this approach, the contextual model can contribute to the ongoing work of developing targeted measures for cyber risk mitigation in the maritime domain and can be used as a point of departure for further studies to discover additional nuances and factors within cyber risk perception in this domain.

TI  - Study on Applicability of Energy-Saving Devices to Hydrogen Fuel Cell-Powered Ships
AB  - The decarbonisation of waterborne transport is arguably the biggest challenge faced by the maritime industry presently. By 2050, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping industry by 50\% compared to 2008, with a vision to phase out fossil fuels by the end of the century as a matter of urgency. To meet such targets, action must be taken immediately to address the barriers to adopt the various clean shipping options currently at different technological maturity levels. Green hydrogen as an alternative fuel presents an attractive solution to meet future targets from international bodies and is seen as a viable contributor within a future clean shipping vision. The cost of hydrogen fuel-in the short-term at least-is higher compared to conventional fuel; therefore, energy-saving devices (ESDs) for ships are more important than ever, as implementation of rules and regulations restrict the use of fossil fuels while promoting zero-emission technology. However, existing and emerging ESDs in standalone/combination for traditional fossil fuel driven vessels have not been researched to assess their compatibility for hydrogen-powered ships, which present new challenges and considerations within their design and operation. Therefore, this review aims to bridge that gap by firstly identifying the new challenges that a hydrogen-powered propulsion system brings forth and then reviewing the quantitative energy saving capability and qualitive additional benefits of individual existing and emerging ESDs in standalone and combination, with recommendations for the most applicable ESD combinations with hydrogen-powered waterborne transport presented to maximise energy saving and minimise the negative impact on the propulsion system components. In summary, the most compatible combination ESDs for hydrogen will depend largely on factors such as vessel types, routes, propulsion, operation, etc. However, the mitigation of load fluctuations commonly encountered during a vessels operation was viewed to be a primary area of interest as it can have a negative impact on hydrogen propulsion system components such as the fuel cell; therefore, the ESD combination that can maximise energy savings as well as minimise the fluctuating loads experienced would be viewed as the most compatible with hydrogen-powered waterborne transport.

TI  - From CCS to CCU-Carbon capture and utilization
AB  - R&amp;D efforts so far have been concentrated on the development of CCS (Carbon Capture and Sequestration), with the main focus on how to remove CO2 from flue gases and how to bury it forever in deep aquifers or exhausted oil &amp; gas reservoirs. The present paper illustrates a completely different approach: Not CO2, but solid carbon is captured, not for disposal, but for re-utilization (CCU = Carbon Capture and Utilization). The CarbonSaverÂ® process, developed by Atlantic Hydrogen Inc., Canada, treats natural gas with a low energy 'cold plasma' in order to remove solid carbon. What remains is a 'decarbonized natural gas' (with ratio's H:C=4.5-6) which can be used with the benefit of reducing GHG emissions without the need of CO2 capture and sequestration. The technology has a large application potential: All natural gas users can benefit from the 'cleaner' natural gas with less CO2 emissions: Prime movers (motors and turbines), CNG mobility as well as residential gas networks ('green gas'). The removed carbon is a high-value product with properties similar to 'carbon black'. While offering interesting development possibilities on the gas side, the CarbonSaverÂ® process represents a potential 'game-changer' in the carbon black market. World carbon black production-today oil-based and highly CO2 emission intensive-could be replaced by a clean natural gas based technology which is completely emission-free. The combined benefit for both natural gas users and carbon black producers represents an interesting environmental and economic impact potential of this technology. The process has been tested in a pilot plant and two demonstration projects are under development as a first step into an industrial application. Â© 2011 Offshore Mediterranean Conference.

TI  - Power to the people?
AB  - The government wants to see businesses and householders across the UK generating their own energy. Rightly or wrongly, government policy is likely to favor a mix of energy sources in future. New nuclear power stations will come on stream before the decade is out. Coal-fired power stations will continue to operate, although with mandatorily-fitted carbon capture and storage technology, expensive wind and tidal energy farms will find backers, and community energy projects will increase in popularity. The introduction of the feed-in tariffs mechanism in April has been designed to convince businesses, schools, community groups and householders to dip their hand in their pockets to pay for on-site renewables. Climate Change Minister, Greg Barker, says he wants to see what more the Government can do to help develop the microgeneration industry and get more advice to businesses so that they can trust the technology on the market.

TI  - Sensitivity of the oceanic carbon reservoir to tropical surface wind stress variations
AB  - The impact of variations of the Walker cell on the ocean carbon cycle is assessed using a coupled climate model. Idealized wind perturbations are investigated, with the trade winds increased/decreased by 10%, 20%, and 30%. A global-mean reduction in oceanic carbon storage is found for increased equatorial easterlies, while moderately decreased trade winds give increased uptake. There is a nonlinear response to weakened tropical winds due to Pacific Ocean biological pump changes; with reduced nutrient upwelling resulting in decreased biological activity and remineralization in the deep ocean. This partially offsets the increased carbon uptake due to weaker trade winds. The overall change in net carbon storage reaches -26.2 PgC (12 ppm) in the 30% increase case and 4.2 PgC (-2 ppm) in the 20% decrease cases. Regional dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) changes reach -3.3 mmol m-3 (2.1 mmol m -3) in the 10% decrease (increase) case. Gradually increasing wind perturbations give a similar pattern of DIC response to the full equilibrated solution. Â© 2013 American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Hybrid energy system for St. Martin Island, Bangladesh: An optimized model
AB  - St. Martin's island is a small island in the Bay of Bengal about 9 km south of the main land of Bangladesh. Nearly 6000 inhabitants live there and fishing is their primary livelihood. Since the island is far away from the main land grid connection is almost impossible in terms of cost and geographic location. However, the electricity demand is partly fulfilled by stand alone diesel generators. In this study, an attempt has been made to model a hybrid electricity generation system for a small community of the island. This system incorporates a combination of solar PV, wind turbine, battery and diesel generator. HOMER software is used to analyze and find out the optimum configuration among a set of systems for electricity requirement for 100 households and 10 shops. The system must satisfy the requirements of 78 kWh/day primary load with 20 kW peak load. Sensitivity analysis is also done to see the impact of solar insolation, PV investment cost, wind speed and diesel fuel price on the optimum result. Solar PV (8 kWp), 2 wind turbines (3 kW) each, diesel generator (15 kW) and 25 batteries (800Ah each) hybrid system is found to be the best among all the configuration in terms of cost of electricity (COE). This configuration gives lowest COE Tk 26.54 / kWh (US\$ 0.345/kWh) and total net present cost (NPC)of Tk 10,620,388 (USD\$ 137,927) with a renewable fraction of 31\%. This system can reduce CO2 emission by about14 tons per year compared to diesel generator only. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Subsea systems innovations and the use of state of art subsea technologies help the flow assurance of heavy oil production in ultra-deep waters
AB  - Flow assurance in ultra-deep waters oil production is always a major concern. Atlanta field, which produces heavy oil in ultra-deep waters, is one of the most challenging project offshore combining several difficulties: hydrates formation, emulsion tendency, scale formation, foaming, high viscosities that can achieve 100.000 cp at sea bed temperatures, etc. To overcome these challenges, the best subsea system technologies has been used, together with some small, but ingenuous, innovations. The use of a 6" unbonded flexible lines, with TEC 2 insulation layers minimize the risk high viscosities in case of the expected shut downs. To cope with scales, foaming and emulsion, chemical additives can be deployed into the wells through the biggest and unique umbilical installed in Brazil, which accommodates 15 hoses, 2 MV Electrical Cables of 3X150mm2 and 2 Eletrical Cables with 4x6mm2 and 2 eletrical cable of 4x2,5mm2. Hydrates can block the flowlines stopping the production. When it occurs, the remediation is normally long and expensive. For hydrates, the clichÃ© "prevention is better than remediation" is true. Hydrates can be prevented with proper procedures and preventers. But in case of hydrate formation, a pioneer hydrate mitigation panel, operated by ROV was installed in the wet christmas tree (deployed by cables). And finally, to guarantee the production flexibility for production and maintenance, an innovative and unique subsea lay out, consisting of two Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP), one in-well and other in mud line skid, was developed and installed. All this innovations and best technologies used together made Atlanta a successful case of heavy oil production in ultra-deep waters, triggering huge resources around the world.

TI  - Planning-Oriented resilience assessment and enhancement of integrated electricity-gas system considering multi-type natural disasters
AB  - A planning-oriented resilience assessment and enhancement approach is proposed that can efficiently deal with multi-type natural disasters. A unified disaster modelling framework is proposed to extract key information from various potential disaster scenarios, thus forming a disaster scenario database. The impact-increment-based enumeration method is applied, and a reusable impact-increment database is established to speed up the assessment process. The reusable database is also utilized to calculate component-level resilience indices and economic indices, so as to make enhancement strategies against potential disasters within planning time scale. Resilience assessment on an integrated electricity-gas system in Taiwan's coastal seismic statistical zone shows that the proposed method can significantly improve the computational efficiency as compared to existing methods. Numerical results indicate that the resilient planning considering the diversity of natural disaster types comprehensively improves the system resilience, which means it is not only concerned with the system performance under a single type of disaster. In addition, the most suitable resilience enhancement scheme with insufficient funds shall be developed according to the economic indices, instead of the component-level resilience indices that cannot balance the resilience enhancement effect with the implementation cost.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and fluxes of restored mangroves in abandoned aquaculture ponds
AB  - There has been a growing interest in restoring mangroves to reduce and offset carbon (C) emissions, but it is still unknown whether restored mangroves provide blue carbon' services similar to natural ones. This study aimed to determine if 10 year-old restored mangroves in abandoned aquaculture ponds in Perancak Estuary, Bali have similar net primary productivity (NPP) and C sequestration to those of intact mangroves. Tidal re-instatement in the ponds has occurred and facilitated mangrove regeneration and sediment accumulation. We found that NPP were similar between natural and restored mangroves. Soil C sequestration in restored mangroves was similar to the natural mangroves, but the soil respiration (CO2 efflux) was lower. The source of C in mangrove sediments was mainly of mangrove origin, confirming the role of NPP in sediment C sequestration. We suggest that many components of the carbon cycle of the mangroves have been restored within 10 years since the reestablishment of the mangrove.

TI  - Materials and Technology for Supply of Renewable Energy and Prevention of Global Warming
AB  - We are proposing global carbon dioxide recycling to use solar energy for all people in the whole world. The electricity will be generated by solar cell in the deserts and used for production of hydrogen by seawater electrolysis at the nearby desert coasts. Hydrogen with no existing infrastructures for transportation and combustion will be converted to methane at the desert coasts by the reaction with carbon dioxide captured by energy consumers. Among systems in global carbon dioxide recycling, seawater electrolysis and carbon dioxide methanation have not been performed industrially. We tailored anodes for oxygen evolution without chlorine formation in seawater electrolysis, effective cathodes for hydrogen production and catalysts for methane formation by the reaction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

TI  - Environmental aspects of produced water from offshore platforms on the Dutch continental shelf
AB  - In a joint Industry program, the composition and the environmental risk of produced water discharges on the Dutch Continental Shelf was investigated, along with the investigation of existing heavy metal removal technology potentially suitable for offshore application. On fifteen gas platforms and four oil platforms on the Dutch Continental Shelf samples have been taken of produced water, which subsequently were analyzed for general physical chemical waste water characteristics, oil and 'oil related compounds, mono- And poly-cyclichydrocarbons, other organics, heavy metals and radionuclides. The environmental risk of produced water discharges was evaluated on the basis of acute toxicity data from bio-assays, of data of individual compounds, fate determination and bio-accumulation. Finally, existing/ proven technology capable of reducing volatile hydrocarbons (BTEX) and/or heavy metal content from produced water and that was potentially suitable for offshore application was investigated. The following conclusions can be drawn from the program results: The general composition is presented in table 1; the concentrations of chemical constituents in gas produced water are considerably higher than those in oil produced water; gas produced water may be considered as moderately to practically non-toxic, according to the GESAMPâˆ— classification; acute toxicity expressed as median lethal or effect concentration may vary over more than three orders of magnitude; a dilution of 3.000 is required for gas platform produced water to attain the lowest 96-hr no-effect- concentration for the acute toxicity for the most sensitive species; for gas platform produced water the dilution of 3.000 will be reached within 7 mins. at a distance of 50 300 m from the point of discharge. no existing suitable technology for heavy metal removal was identified; for removal of BTEX, air stripping seems to be a promising method.

TI  - Effects of Well Placement on CO2 Emissions from Waterflooding Operation
AB  - Water injection provides efficient pressure support and increases oil recovery in field developments worldwide. The success of water injection comes from its cheap and simple application. However, waterflooding is an energy intensive operation. Typically, more than one third of total energy use in offshore platforms is allocated for water injection. Since many offshore platforms still rely on gas turbines as their main energy source, waterflooding thus accounts for a substantial portion of total CO2 emissions. The quantity of CO2 emitted depends on the injection strategy being adopted; both on the well placement and on the injection rates and pressures during production life. Traditional optimization of drainage strategies has given little heed to the cost of emissions. In this work this emission cost will be an integral part of the injection strategy optimization, as we will include the cost of emissions into our optimization objective. We formulate the optimization objective (net present value) so that it incorporates the cost of CO2 emission: Our augmented objective function includes not only revenue and cost of production, but also carbon tax proportional to CO2 emitted. Moreover, we introduce a scheme for quantifying CO2 emissions corresponding to a particular injection strategy. This scheme is based on an integrated subsurface-topside model and utilizes reservoir simulation results for calculating the energy spent by the water pump and treatment systems. This energy is then used to estimate the fuel consumption for water injection and the corresponding CO2 emissions. We conduct the optimization study using a two-dimensional numerical reservoir simulation model. In addition, we optimize over a range of CO2 tax rates and investigate how the different tax regimes affect the optimal solution and associated carbon emissions. Our results indicate that the optimal well placement is dependent on the CO2 tax rate. A higher CO2 tax rate moves the optimal injection location towards higher permeable zones. This leads to lower oil production and lower emissions. However, the relative reduction in emissions is larger than the relative reduction in oil production.

TI  - DAS SYSTEM MODELING AND DATA VALIDATION FOR CCS MONITORING
AB  - Monitoring of CCS facilities with fiber optic has increased rapidly over the last six years. As part of carbon capture and storage monitoring fiber optic tools have been deployed at different test sites. This monitoring has taken advantage of enhancements in distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) technology. Here we present a workflow to assess optimal optical acquisition to acquire seismic signals, passive and active, that are needed for permanent reservoir surveillance. We present data from new DAS interrogators units capable of sensing long distances that would encompass CCS projects being developed on land and offshore. Data presented here includes active seismic within a shallow CCS facility connected to a long fiber optic line. In addition the long range technology is validated for passive induced seismicity surveillance. We demonstrate that the fiber optic DAS systems have high sensitivity needed for high resolution imaging of storage facilities and for detectability of potential induced events during permanent injection monitoring.

TI  - Succession of states mathematical algorithm for incorporation of unit operation in iCONÂ® process simulator applied in natural gas purification
AB  - Over recent years, incorporation of unit operation in industrial process simulators remains an intriguing area of research. This is especially applicable to natural gas plant aimed for CO2 gas removal in offshore platform that is often accompanied with a number of unit operations, complicated configurations, non-standard operating conditions and high impurities content. In addition, it is highly desirable to link the natural gas purification unit with other pretreatment, dehydration and auxiliary equipments already implemented in the process simulators to constitute the entire process plant. Although research work has arisen in this area, the incorporation is particularly challenging for iCONÂ® process simulator since it does not inherit the intrinsic capability to incorporate standalone models of additional unit operations. Nonetheless, the incorporation is of exceptional importance since the intrinsic physical property and thermodynamic databases of iCONÂ® process simulator can be employed conveniently to determine heating value of the product streams. Therefore, in current research work, a mathematical model has been developed to describe the countercurrent hollow fiber membrane module, which has been integrated as an extension in iCONÂ® through utilization of the export/import functions embedded within the Excel unit operation of the process simulator. Validity of the simulation model has been demonstrated through good accordance with published literature. It is found that by determining the separation mechanism via adaptation of the mathematical model, heating value of the purified product stream can be reflected directly in iCONÂ® to evaluate feasibility of the entire process design in offshore natural gas purification platform.

TI  - Super clean marine diesel engines with nonthermal plasma aftertreatment technology
AB  - Diesel engine is an attractive energy conversion device that emits low CO2 from the viewpoint of the global warming and is widely used for various industries. The problem is that the emission contains air pollutants such as NOx and particulate matter. Regulations governing marine diesel engine NOx emissions have recently become more stringent. As it is difficult to fulfill these requirements by combustion improvements alone, effective aftertreatment technologies are needed to achieve efficient NOx reductions. In this study, we develop an effective NOx reduction aftertreatment system for a marine diesel engine that employs combined nonthermal plasma (NTP) and adsorption. Compared with selective catalytic reduction, the proposed technology offers the advantages of not requiring a urea solution or harmful heavy-metal catalysts and low operating temperatures of less than 150 Â°C. The NOx reduction comprises repeated adsorption and desorption flow processes using NTP combined with NOx adsorbents made of MnOxâ€“CuO. High concentrations of NOx are treated by NTP after NOx adsorption and desorption, and this aftertreatment system demonstrates excellent energy efficiencies of 161 g (NO2)/kWh, which fulfills the most recent International Maritime Organization emission NOx standards in the Tier II to III regulations for 2016 and requires only 4.3 % of the engine output power.

TI  - Carbon Sink Potential of Avicennia marina in the Al-Qurm Nature Reserve, Muscat, Oman
AB  - Climate change is a global issue, caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting in many adverse effects. One of the many responses to the climate change impact is to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Al-Qurm Nature Reserve in Muscat city of Oman is a mangrove vegetation protected by law as conservation area. Carbon sequestration was estimated in three distinct zones of this natural mangrove vegetation with Avicennia marina. The mean carbon stock in the middle zone was 7.7 +/- 0.3 kg C/m(2), and for the seaward zone was 5.3 +/- 0.7 kg C/m(2), and for landward 18.8 +/- 0.1 kg C/m(2), which is 3.5 times higher than seaward zone and slightly more than 2 times than middle zone. The 0.82 km(2) of Al-Qurm Nature Reserve occupied purely by Avicennia marina was estimated to sink about 8692 t C (0.0087 Mt C) equivalent to about 0.032 Mt of CO2e. These estimates suggest a high carbon storage and carbon sequestration potential of Avicennia marina in Al-Qurm Nature Reserve despite their relatively small area.

For decades, water supply was provided mostly from the Dnieper River via the North Crimean Canal. An emergency situation arose in water supply in Crimea after the canal was shut down. It has been shown that seawater desalination from renewables is the only reliable way to tackle the problem. The work reviews perspective desalination methods, suggests a new schematic of a desalination complex based on Wind Energy Marine Units, and determines key parameters of the complex.

TI  - Ancillary Benefits of Climate Policies in the Shipping Sector
AB  - According to the latest estimates presented by IMO in â€œThird IMO GHG Study 2014â€ total shipping sector emitted 938 million tonnes of CO2 in 2012 that is about 2.6% of the total global CO2 anthropogenic emissions for that year. Although shipping is the most energy-efficient mode of mass transport and only a modest contributor to overall CO2 emissions, a global approach to further improve its energy efficiency and effective emission control is needed, as sea transport will continue growing apace with world trade. Emissions from international shipping cannot be attributed to any particular national economy due to its global nature and complex operation. This chapter covers policy measures towards climate and environmental protection within the shipping sector and in doing so, provides a detailed overview of the existing regulations of IMO and EU, analysing ancillary benefits of climate change policies.

TI  - Crypthecodinium cohnii Growth and Omega Fatty Acid Production in Mediums Supplemented with Extract from Recycled Biomass
AB  - Crypthecodinium cohnii is a marine heterotrophic dinoflagellate that can accumulate high amounts of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and thus has the potential to replace conventional PUFAs production with eco-friendlier technology. So far, C. cohnii cultivation has been mainly carried out with the use of yeast extract (YE) as a nitrogen source. In the present study, alternative carbon and nitrogen sources were studied: the extraction ethanol (EE), remaining after lipid extraction, as a carbon source, and dinoflagellate extract (DE) from recycled algae biomass C. cohnii as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and vitamins. In mediums with glucose and DE, the highest specific biomass growth rate reached a maximum of 1.012 hâˆ’1, while the biomass yield from substrate reached 0.601 gÂ·gâˆ’1 . EE as the carbon source, in comparison to pure ethanol, showed good results in terms of stimulating the biomass growth rate (an 18.5% increase in specific biomass growth rate was observed). DE supplement to the EE-based mediums promoted both the biomass growth (the specific growth rate reached 0.701 hâˆ’1 ) and yield from the substrate (0.234 gÂ·gâˆ’1 ). The FTIR spectroscopy data showed that mediums supplemented with EE or DE promoted the accumulation of PUFAs/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), when compared to mediums containing glucose and commercial YE.

TI  - First mile wireless and beyond: Future applications for wireless in oil and gas
AB  - Oil field asset owners and operators face two primary issues in exploration and production; asset productivity and operating efficiency. Typically, operators do not have visibility to sense the current state of the oil field and respond with actions to reduce well down-time or increase the oil flow. These sense-and-respond capabilities have been limited by the remoteness of this ``First Mile{''} and its fundamental lack of connectivity. Recent advances in wireless technologies resolve this limitation, and operators are looking to extend the office experience into the first mile, creating sophisticated sense and respond capabilities that increase asset productivity while reducing costs and improving communication and collaboration. This paper will briefly review current state of wireless in oil and gas and discuss the future applications enabled by first mile wireless, including: Converged Health, Safety, and Environmental communications: enabling all responders to communicate across disparate radio networks, and phone systems in a unified conversation to accelerate and improve incident response Asset and personnel tracking systems: leveraging location based services to transform plant operations and health, safety, and environmental response Real-time video collaboration to field: taking field and collaboration center beyond voice and data, enabling workers in the center to *}see{*} what is happening in the field Automated sensor networks for monitoring production control systems: Monitor temperature, pressure, flow, vibration and other environmental situations to improve operations and reduce downtime Integrated physical security systems: provide improved camera coverage and authorized access to any camera stream from anywhere to increase safety and improve incident response Real-time vehicle fleet access, onshore and offshore: connect with mobile vehicles and staff using the best possible network backbone, including satellite, 3G, GPRS, or WiFi enabling anytime, anywhere access to staff and systems on vehicles or vessels supporting field operations Instant mobile communications for extreme remote locations: Deliver true office communication experience to anywhere in the world, enabling exploration or other nomadic operations to connect and collaborate with global peers.

TI  - Seagrass biomass and their role as carbon reservoirs in the localities of San Andres Island and La Guajira, Colombian Caribbean [Biomasa de pastos marinos y su rol como sumideros de carbono en las localidades de la isla de San Andres y La Guajira, Caribe colombiano]
AB  - Seagrass meadows have stood out for being very effective fixing atmospheric carbon, among others, due to their ability to produce plant biomass. Therefore, the values of shoot density (m2), biomass (cores) and carbon present in 12 locations with Thalassia testudinum at the Colombian Caribbean (La Guajira and San AndrÃ©s Island) were quantified. The biological samples were processed in laboratory until obtaining the values of aerial, underground and total dry weight, and the estimation of the carbon was stablishing from a ratio of 35 % of the dry biomass. Statistical tests were carried out to determine significant differences between the sites, highlighting the aerial biomass in La Guajira and the underground biomass in San AndrÃ©s. It was calculated that the total carbon in the seagrasses' biomass from La Guajira were 197 484 Mg C and in San AndrÃ©s 1835.4 Mg C. The difference between locations were due to particular geomorphological and intrinsic factors. It is highlighted that, although the carbon retained in the biomass (aerial and underground) is comparatively lower than in sediments, it constitutes the pillar of conservation of both carbon sink as well as for the sustainability of the ecosystem.

TI  - Numerical modeling of pore-scale phenomena during CO2 sequestration in oceanic sediments
AB  - Direct disposal of liquid CO2 on the ocean floor is one of the approaches considered for sequestering CO2 in order to reduce its concentration in the atmosphere. At oceanic depths deeper than approximately 3000 in, liquid CO2 density is higher than the density of seawater and CO2 is expected to sink and form a pool at the ocean floor. In addition to chemical reactions between CO2 and seawater to form hydrate, fluid displacement is also expected to occur within the ocean floor sediments. In this work, we consider two different numerical models for hydrate fort-nation at the pore scale. The first model consists of the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method applied to a single-phase supersaturated solution in a constructed porous medium. The second model is based on the Invasion Percolation (IP) in pore networks, applied to two-phase immiscible displacement of seawater by liquid CO2. The pore-scale results are upscaled to obtain constitutive relations for porosity, both transverse and for the entire domain, and for permeability. We examine deposition and displacement. patterns, and changes in porosity and permeability due to hydrate formation, and how these properties depend on various parameters including a parametric study of the effect of hydrate formation kinetics. According to the simulations, the depth Of CO2 invasion in the sediments is controlled by changes in the pore-scale porosity close to the hydrate formation front. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sources of marine biomass
AB  - The majority of biomass used for biofuel production is from terrestrial sources. Land-based biomass for fuel can displace other agricultural activities and food production as well. The increasing demand for land has caused deforestation and shortages of food and resulted in increased food prices and civil unrest. Solutions to the increased demand for plant products for food, fuel, etc., include an increase in yields of all crops and a greater utilization of marine biomass. Nowadays, the increasing energy demand for public transport and the rise in oil prices are an intensifying interest in using green fuel for a sustainable future. The most common biofuels are ethanol produced from corn or sugarcane and biodiesel produced from a variety of oil crops such as soybeans and oil palm. Another potential type of biomass is marine biomass, which has the additional benefit. At present, marine biomass is considered as a potential biofuel feedstock. Marine biomass comprises of macro- and microalgae. Microalgae are potential sources of bio-oils, while macroalgae are potential sources of carbohydrates for fermentation or thermochemical-based conversions (Adams et al. 2011a). It can be anaerobically digested to produce methane, which, in turn, can be used to generate electricity, for heat or for transport (RCEP 2004). Plants in general are efficient solar energy converters and can create large amounts of biomass in a short term (Kraan 2013). However, marine biomass or marine algae are often an overlooked source when they potentially represent a significant source of renewable energy. Other points considered in view of marine biomass are increase in marine animal habitat size and fishery resources, protection of natural seaweed beds, and widening of seaweed feedstock farming areas, which are all beneficial for the conservation of biodiversity on coastal ecosystems and the global environment (Notoya 2007).

TI  - Ultra-deep resistivity technology as a solution for efficient well placement; geosteering and fluid mapping to reduce reservoir uncertainty and eliminate pilot hole-first time in offshore Abu Dhabi, UAE
AB  - This paper present the successful deployment of the ultra-deep EM tool in a mature carbonate reservoirs to reduce the uncertainty associated with fluid movement for horizontal/ MRC well-placement optimization and enable precise geosteering to maintain distance from fluid boundaries and mapping of nearby reservoirs for future reservoir development. In addition, the EM tool can facilitate to optimise lower completion design liner (blank pipe length, PPL, ICD and swellable packer depth). The high heterogeneity of reservoir qualities increase uncertainty in fluid distribution and make drilling long horizontal, oil producer wells in offshore mature giant carbonate fields very challenging. The usual plan is to drill a pilot hole crossing the reservoir sections, evaluate log saturation, and then re-optimize horizontal sections accordingly. To study the possibility of eliminating pilot holes, an ultra-deep electromagnetic (EM) tool was deployed. The first objective was to detect reservoir boundaries and predict resistivity of the target before penetrating it (Geostopping). The second objective was to optimize the horizontal drain (Geosteering), and map resistivity of adjacent reservoirs for well completion and future well optimisation (Geomapping). Pre-well inversion modeling was conducted to optimize the spacing and firing frequency selection in order to facilitate early real-time geosteering and geostopping decisions. The plan was to run the ultra-deep resistivity tool in conjunction with shallow propagation resistivity and density-neutron porosity while drilling the 8Â½ in landing section. The objective was to be able to detect the lithology boundary early and predict the resistivity of the reservoir before penetrating, facilitating geostopping decisions. This would allow optimization of the horizontal section to geosteer the well in an oil-saturated layer 4-6 feet from top boundary while geomapping the surrounding reservoirs' resistivity. The EM tool delivered accurate mapping of thin reservoir layers while drilling the 8Â½ in section, as well as enhanced mapping of low resistivity zones up to 85 feet true vertical thickness in a challenging low-resistivity environment. Comparison to recorded open-hole logs for validation showed good results, enabling identification of the optimal geostopping point in the 8Â½ in. section. The EM tool is able to save up to five rig days in the future by eliminating pilot holes. The 6 inch horizontal section was successfully geosteered and placed 4-6 feet from top boundary. The EM tool was able to map reservoir resistivity 30 feet TVD below the wellbore and the completion design was designed accordingly. Additionally, the EM inversion for the nearby reservoirs helped to modify the plans for nearby future wells. Â© 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers

TI  - Geochemical evaluation of CO2 injection into storage reservoirs based on case-studies in The Netherlands
AB  - Over the past few years several geochemical evaluations of CO2 storage in Dutch potential reservoirs are carried out, including predictions of the short-and long-term impact of CO2 on the reservoir using geochemical modelling. The initial mineralogy of the reservoir is frequently obtained from core analysis and is then used to compute the formation water composition. In this paper geochemical modelling with TOUGHREACT is used to predict and compare the short-and long-term geochemical impact of CO2 injection into three reservoirs. The mineralogical composition of these reservoirs is an assemblage based on commonly observed minerals from the Buntsandstein and Rotliegend formations. These formations contain potential onshore and offshore CO2 storage locations in the Netherlands. The results predict drying out and salt precipitation in the near-well area, due to water evaporation by the injected dry CO2. Several mineral transformations are predicted, dominated by the transformation of albite into dawsonite, thereby fixing CO2. Due to the relatively low density of dawsonite, the porosity significantly decreases, which can lead to a pore pressure increase. Disabling of dawsonite precipitation in the simulations, thereby taking into account the ongoing debate on dawsonite stability, only shows a small increase of the porosity. Future (experimental) work should be focused on dawsonite occurrence for accurate predictions of the long-term reservoir integrity. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The Sensitivity of the Marine Carbonate System to Regional Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement
AB  - Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) simultaneously mitigates atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and ocean acidification; however, no previous studies have investigated the response of the non-linear marine carbonate system sensitivity to alkalinity enhancement on regional scales. We hypothesise that regional implementations of OAE can sequester more atmospheric CO2 than a global implementation. To address this, we investigate physical regimes and alkalinity sensitivity as drivers of the carbon-uptake potential response to global and different regional simulations of OAE. In this idealised ocean-only set-up, total alkalinity is enhanced at a rate of 0.25 Pmol a-1 in 75-year simulations using the Max Planck Institute Ocean Model coupled to the HAMburg Ocean Carbon Cycle model with pre-industrial atmospheric forcing. Alkalinity is enhanced globally and in eight regions: the Subpolar and Subtropical Atlantic and Pacific gyres, the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean. This study reveals that regional alkalinity enhancement has the capacity to exceed carbon uptake by global OAE. We find that 82â€“175 Pg more carbon is sequestered into the ocean when alkalinity is enhanced regionally and 156 PgC when enhanced globally, compared with the background-state. The Southern Ocean application is most efficient, sequestering 12% more carbon than the Global experiment despite OAE being applied across a surface area 40 times smaller. For the first time, we find that different carbon-uptake potentials are driven by the surface pattern of total alkalinity redistributed by physical regimes across areas of different carbon-uptake efficiencies. We also show that, while the marine carbonate system becomes less sensitive to alkalinity enhancement in all experiments globally, regional responses to enhanced alkalinity vary depending upon the background concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity. Furthermore, the Subpolar North Atlantic displays a previously unexpected alkalinity sensitivity increase in response to high total alkalinity concentrations.

TI  - Computational fluid dynamic simulation with experimental validation in turbine pipeline
AB  - With the increase of carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases generated by the consumption of fossil fuels, this research considers the use of alternative energy sources, like the tidal energy which stores and contains the water in a reservoir through a dam or levee. This energy is later released and is converted into electrical energy through the unidirectional flushing of the fluid by a turbine pipeline, emerging variables such as pressure, speed magnitude, and turbulent kinetic energy. These variables will be studied using a computer dynamic 2D model simulated by the ANSYS FLUENT software by setting boundary conditions obtained by digital methodology of classical mechanics of fluids. The results were compared with those obtained experimentally through a tidal module, which consists of elements that were selected after criterion arrays, finding that, during the fluid download process for the energy generation, there is a qualitative similarity in the four areas of the pipeline of turbine (entry, final part of the leeward side of the bulb, posterior and anterior to the propeller), as well as the quantitative values presented similarity in two inner points of the turbine pipeline, getting an error of 1.69% and 1.95% respectively, thus validating the prediction.

TI  - Emissions in maritime transport: A decomposition analysis from the perspective of production-based and consumption-based emissions
AB  - Since most of the carbon emissions from maritime transportation occur in the international sea, it is difficult to divide the emission responsibilities, which hinders the control of maritime transportation carbon emissions. To clarify the emission responsibility, these key drivers of maritime transport carbon emission from the perspectives of both production-based and consumption-based was decomposed by combining the multi-regional input-output model and structural decomposition analysis. The results show: (1) The overall emissions of the maritime transport showed a trend of ``rising-slightly falling-stable{''}, which was mainly affected by the globalization and the economic crisis. (2) Owing to the differences in geographic location and economic level, the change pattern of emissions varied among the 11 major maritime emission countries. Among them, the United States was the only net importer of carbon emissions embodied in maritime transport. (3) In general, the decline in emission intensity had always played a positive role in carbon emission reduction, and the production-oriented and demand-oriented structural adjustments had become new driving forces for maritime transport decarbonization in the later period.

TI  - Assessment of large-scale offshore CO2 geological storage in Western Taiwan Basin
AB  - A million-ton-scale CO2 geological storage project was planned by the Taiwan Power Company in the Taiwan Basin. The site, half on-shore and half off-shore, has a regional shale formation underlain by two sandy saline aquifers. Numerical models were used to comprehensively assess CO2 geological storage including the CO2 plume evolution, pressure buildup, impacts on the shallow fresh groundwater, phase transition of CO2 potentially moving in a vertical fault, and uplift of the land surface over 500 years for a 50-year CO2 injection at a rate of 5 million tons per year. The results suggested that the reservoir could reliably store and contain the injected CO2 for 500 years. All formations could stand the pressure buildup related to the large injection volume. The modeled CO2 plumes did not either penetrate through the cap rock or reach the fault north to the injection wells. The assumed monitor point for shallow groundwater on the shore showed no changes in water head and water quality during 500 years. Phase transition simulations showed that escape of CO2 from a deep storage reservoir to the land surface through a vertical fault is a complex interaction of multiphase fluid flow and heat transfer. CO2 rising toward the land surface evolves into two-phase mixtures of liquid and gaseous CO2 as temperatures and pressures decrease, inducing three-phase flow of CO2-brine mixtures. The presence of a three-phase zone (aqueous-liquid CO2-gaseous CO2) leads to a small relative permeability for all phases, and in turn makes all phases less mobile and reduces CO2 discharge rates. The proposed injection would induce a couple of centimeters uplift in the land surface during the 50-year injection period, but it would recover to the initial elevation at a slower rate than that of the uplift.

TI  - Saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass using seawater and halotolerant cellulase with potential application in second-generation bioethanol production
AB  - Global water scarcity at an alarming stage has triggered the interest of many environmentalists and global researchers. Use of freshwater in biomass-based industries would result in depletion of a precious natural resource, which is not sustainable in the long term. Thus, water management technologies are critical to the successful operation of an ethanol plant. Utilization of seawater-based systems and halotolerant enzymes can be a breakthrough in this context. The present study involves marine bacterial strainsBacillus oceanisediminis,Brevibacterium halotolerans, andPsychrobacter celercapable of producing halotolerant cellulases, isolated from Gopalpur, Odisha. The crude enzyme extracts and direct bacterial cultures were independently utilized for saccharification of pretreated rice straw, and the treated rice straw was characterized for the production of reducing sugars using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The possible bond breakage and formation during saccharification of cellulose was assessed using attenuated total reflectance with Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The relative fraction and size of crystallites in cellulose was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) study. The biomass saccharified using the crude cellulase fromB. oceanisediminswas utilized for the production of bioethanol in freshwater and seawater-based media usingSaccharomyces cerevisiaeNCIM 3570 andCandida shehataeNCIM 3500. The maximum fermentation efficiency (45.74\%) was recorded for saccharified rice straw in freshwater using a consortium of immobilized yeasts. The highest fermentation efficiency (36.69\%) was recorded in the seawater system by immobilizedS. cerevisiae.

TI  - Projected expansion of Trichodesmiumâ€™s geographical distribution and increase in growth potential in response to climate change
AB  - Estimates of marine N2 fixation range from 52 to 73Â TgÂ N/year, of which we calculate up to 84% is from Trichodesmium based on previous measurements of nifH gene abundance and our new model of Trichodesmium growth. Here, we assess the likely effects of four major climate change-related abiotic factors on the spatiotemporal distribution and growth potential of Trichodesmium for the last glacial maximum (LGM), the present (2006â€“2015) and the end of this century (2100) by mapping our model of Trichodesmium growth onto inferred global surface ocean fields of pCO2, temperature, light and Fe. We conclude that growth rate was severely limited by low pCO2 at the LGM, that current pCO2 levels do not significantly limit Trichodesmium growth and thus, the potential for enhanced growth from future increases in CO2 is small. We also found that the area of the ocean where sea surface temperatures (SST) are within Trichodesmium's thermal niche increased by 32% from the LGM to present, but further increases in SST due to continued global warming will reduce this area by 9%. However, the range reduction at the equator is likely to be offset by enhanced growth associated with expansion of regions with optimal or near optimal Fe and light availability. Between now and 2100, the ocean area of optimal SST and irradiance is projected to increase by 7%, and the ocean area of optimal SST, irradiance and iron is projected to increase by 173%. Given the major contribution of this keystone species to annual N2 fixation and thus pelagic ecology, biogeochemistry and CO2 sequestration, the projected increase in the geographical range for optimal growth could provide a negative feedback to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

TI  - Overview of the Monitas JIP
AB  - This paper provides an overview of the Monitas project, aspects of which are further detailed in accompanied OTC 2010 papers. The Monitas project is a Joint Industry Project that was presented to the offshore industry in 2005 and now the project is close to its completion. The Monitas project has developed the Advisory Monitoring System (AMS) that presents, explains and advises on the fatigue lifetime consumption of FPSO's hulls. The advice is based on comparisons between the design and the actual fatigue lifetimes predicted by replacing the design factors like operational settings, environmental conditions and hydro-structural response by the measured ones. The name Monitas stands for Monitoring Advisory System. The project has demonstrated that the Monitas system installed on board an FPSO enhances the safety of the crew, the asset and the environment by controlling the lifetime consumption of the hull. Deviations from the design conditions can be timely identified and actions can be undertaken to secure sufficient lifetime in case it is being consumed too fast. The beauty of the system lies in the fact that the system identifies which factor contributes mostly to faster lifetime consumption. The project recommends including the requirement for such a system in the contract specification. This allows for a proper documentation of the fatigue lifetime calculations and cost-effective implementation of the system without expensive change orders. The project results are applicable directly to all FPSOs and with some modifications to all floating structures. The Monitas system, when installed, can give justification for lifetime extension. The paper ends with plans for improving the system. Copyright 2010, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Evaluation of carbon dioxide storage potential for the Bohai Basin, north-east China
AB  - The storage potential of selected sites within the Bohai Basin was assessed for the COACH project. The Gangdong oilfield is considered to have a small potential storage capacity (23. Mt) and to be possibly suitable for an enhanced oil recovery or small-scale storage pilot rather than large-scale storage. The Shengli oilfield province is considered to have a great potential storage capacity (472. Mt in eight selected fields), however, these fields, like those of the Gangdong oilfield province, are compartmentalised by faulting and stratigraphy and likely to be quite challenging for injection. Unmineable coal seams in the Kailuan mining area were also considered for storage, the estimated capacity is 504. Gt adsorbed onto the coal and 38,100. Mt void storage capacity. However, the coals have low porosity and permeability, so they would be expected to have poor injectivity. This is also an active mining area and so any storage site would have to be chosen carefully to avoid affecting future energy resources. The Huimin sub-basin within the Jiyang Depression was identified for consideration as an aquifer storage site; the Guantao Formation has good porosity and permeability in this region, and the regional-level storage capacity of these areas was estimated to be 0.7. Gt. The aquifers in the Huimin sub-basin appear promising for storage, however, less data are available than for the oilfields and the sealing formations are not directly proven to trap buoyant fluids, though in adjacent oilfield in the Shengli oilfield province, the Minghuazhen Formation forms a regional seal for the Guantao Formation.

TI  - Changes in the flow structure and energy loss of a Tsunami current through forest with a gap
AB  - The disastrous events of tsunamis or floods in the past revealed the effectiveness of coastal forest. In tsunami mitigation strategies, interest in a multiple defense system is increasing rather than a single defense structure. This shift to a multiple defense system because the tsunami inundation could sufficiently be delayed and the overflow volume could be reduced compared to that of a single defense system. The previous research studies pointed out the limitation of land use in the coastal area, which is a major problem to construct a thick forest for tsunami mitigation. Thus, the present study conducted flume experiments to clarify the flow structure and energy loss through a forest with a gap, i.e. discontinuous forest model (DFM), under varying steady subcritical flows and varying gaps between the forest models. An experiment with continuous forest model (CFM) was also performed under the same flow conditions for the comparison purpose. The discontinuous forest, i.e. combination of upstream model (UM) and downstream model (DM), resulted in slightly larger backwater rise, i.e. 1-6%, upstream of the models due to higher flow resistance, as compared to that of continuous forest. Hence, due to double reflection (back movement of water wave due to backwater rise) and large resistance offered by DFM, the maximum loss of flow energy became higher, i.e. 37%, compared to that of CFM, i.e. 32%. The results demonstrate that this type of discontinuous forest with the appropriate configuration could be as effective as a continuous forest belt in mitigating the tsunami hazards.

TI  - Impact of geological heterogeneity on earlystage CO2 plume migration
AB  - Injection of CO2 into saline aquifers can be divided in two phases: injection and plume migration over long time scales. Large-scale injection operations should be preceded by simulation studies to determine how to maximize the injection volume/rate and minimize the leakage risk. Simulation of CO2 storage differs from oil recovery prediction not only in the objectives of study, but also in the characteristic length and time scales of the process. Working with long temporal and spatial scales and large uncertainties poses the question of how detailed the geological description should be. The impact of geological uncertainty on the oil production forecast has been thoroughly investigated in the SAIGUP study, where an extensive set of synthetic but realistic models of shallow-marine reservoirs were made. Tens of thousands of simulations were run for different production scenarios, demonstrating that variations in the structural and sedimentological description had a strong impact on production responses. Herein, we use the structural and sedimentological models from SAIGUP to study two questions related to CO2 storage: How sensitive is the injection and early-stage migration to uncertainty and variability in the geological description? What simplifying assumptions are allowed in averaging the geological attributes over scales?

TI  - Total ecosystem carbon stocks at the marine-terrestrial interface: Blue carbon of the Pacific Northwest Coast, United States
AB  - The coastal ecosystems of temperate North America provide a variety of ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration. Yet, little data exist for the carbon stocks of major tidal wetland types in the Pacific Northwest, United States. We quantified the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) in seagrass, emergent marshes, and forested tidal wetlands, occurring along increasing elevation and decreasing salinity gradients. The TECS included the total aboveground carbon stocks and the entire soil profile (to as deep as 3Â m). TECS significantly increased along the elevation and salinity gradients: 217Â Â±Â 60Â MgÂ C/ha for seagrass (low elevation/high salinity), 417Â Â±Â 70Â MgÂ C/ha for low marsh, 551Â Â±Â 47Â MgÂ C/ha for high marsh, and 1,064Â Â±Â 38Â MgÂ C/ha for tidal forest (high elevation/low salinity). Soil carbon stocks accounted for >98% of TECS in the seagrass and marsh communities and 78% in the tidal forest. Soils in the 0â€“100Â cm portion of the profile accounted for only 48%â€“53% of the TECS in seagrasses and marshes and 34% of the TECS in tidal forests. Thus, the commonly applied limit defining TECS to a 100Â cm depth would greatly underestimate both carbon stocks and potential greenhouse gas emissions from land-use conversion. The large carbon stocks coupled with other ecosystem services suggest value in the conservation and restoration of temperate zone tidal wetlands through climate change mitigation strategies. However, the findings suggest that long-term sea-level rise effects such as tidal inundation and increased porewater salinity will likely decrease ecosystem carbon stocks in the absence of upslope wetland migration buffer zones.

TI  - POWER AND HYDROGEN CO-PRODUCTION IN FLEXIBLE "POWDROGEN" PLANTS
AB  - This study investigates the potential of "Powdrogen"plants for blue hydrogen and decarbonized electric power production, conceived to operate flexibly depending on the electricity price and to increase the capacity factor of the hydrogen production and CO2 separation units. The Hydrogen production is based on fired tubular reforming or auto-thermal reforming technologies with pre-combustion CO2 capture by a MDEA process. The power island is based on a combined cycle with H2-fired gas turbine and a triple pressure reheat heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). The analysis considers three main plant operating modes: hydrogen mode (reformer at full load with hydrogen export and combined cycle off) and power mode (reformer at full load with all hydrogen burned in the combined cycle), plus an intermediate polygeneration mode, producing both hydrogen and electricity. The possibility of integrating the HRSG and the reformer heat recovery process to feed a single steam turbine has been explored to allow keeping the steam turbine hot also in hydrogen operating mode. The economic analysis investigates the competitivity of the plant for different operating hours in hydrogen and power modes. Results suggest that these plants are likely to be a viable way to produce flexibly low-carbon hydrogen and electricity following the market demand. Copyright Â© 2022 by ASME and Siemens Energy Inc.

TI  - CORAL SAND SOLIDIFICATION TEST THROUGH MICROBIAL CALCIUM CARBONATE PRECIPITATION USING PARARHODOBACTER SP.
AB  - The coastal erosion has been a problem in associate with manmade construction. The maintenance and management is expensive for repair and rebuild the coast. Compared to the concrete structure coral sand solidification would considered to minimize cost. The present experimental study was conducted to coral sand solidification through microbial carbonate precipitation (MCP) using Pararhodobacter sp. Ureolytic bacteria; Pararhodobacter sp. was isolated from the beachrock in Nago, Okinawa, Japan. ZoBell2216E as a medium for marine bacteria was used for the culture of the bacteria. Suitability for the use in MCP syringe test, growth properties of the bacteria were observed in various cultural conditions. MCP sand solidification test was carried in 30mL Terumo syringe injected bacterial culture fluid. Strength of the specimen was measured by needle penetration test. The maximum value of the absorbance at bacterial growth curve was constant if the added amount of the medium is 100mL. The correlation coefficient of determination for absorbance measurements and viable cell count measurements was obtained 0.5478. In MCP syringe test, pH of the specimen was decreased and Ca2+ concentration was increase with time. The estimated value of unconfined comprehensive strength (UCS) also increased with time. The maximum value of UCS of the specimen was 12MPa. The estimated UCS values of the specimen produced by sand solidification test for 14 days curing time have been achieved.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen input on carbon cycle and carbon budget in a coastal salt marsh
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are an effective blue carbon sink to mitigate climate warming, but their ecosystem stability and carbon sink function are threatened by the large amount of nitrogen input caused by coastal eutrophication. Under the action of regular tides, the high nitrogen content in the coastal waters will have a profound effect on the key processes of carbon cycle such as plant photosynthetic carbon fixation, carbon allocation in plant-soil system, and soil carbon release in the salt marsh. This study reviewed the effects of nitrogen input on plant photosynthetic carbon fixation, carbon allocation in plant-soil system, decomposition of soil organic carbon, formation and release of soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and carbon sequestration in the salt marsh. Based on the shortcomings of current research, this review proposed the directions of future research, including the effects of nitrogen input on plant photosynthetic carbon fixation and carbon allocation in plant-soil system, the microbial mechanism of soil organic carbon decomposition, production and lateral exchange of soil DOC, and the potential impact of different forms of nitrogen input on soil carbon sequestration in the salt marsh. Overall, this study aims to improve the understanding of impacts of nitrogen input on the key carbon processes and the mechanisms of carbon sequestration in a salt marsh, and to provide new ideas for assessing the potential changes of carbon pools under the influence of eutrophication of coastal waters in the salt marsh wetlands.

TI  - LNG - Great opportunity for the Inland Water Transport
AB  - The new general trend of many countries is a move towards replacing fossil fuels such as coal, lignite and oil with the more environmentally friendly natural gas. The weakest link in the process chain of gas from source to final consumer is a long haul. Current technology for natural gas transport over long distances is managed through pipelines or tankers in liquefied form. The usage of LNG technology for propulsion of vessels has been known for decades. It is generally associated with maritime transport of LNG. During the tightening of emission regulations in Europe, Liquefied Natural Gas is considered as an opportunity for the inland waterway sector, but it certainly will not be the remedy for all the structural and economic problems associated with Inland Water Transport.

TI  - How calorie-rich food could help marine calcifiers in a CO2-rich future
AB  - Increasing carbon emissions not only enrich oceans with CO2 but also make them more acidic. This acidifying process has caused considerable concern because laboratory studies show that ocean acidification impairs calcification (or shell building) and survival of calcifiers by the end of this century. Whether this impairment in shell building also occurs in natural communities remains largely unexplored, but requires re-examination because of the recent counter intuitive finding that populations of calcifiers can be boosted by CO2 enrichment. Using natural CO2 vents, we found that ocean acidification resulted in the production of thicker, more crystalline and more mechanically resilient shells of a herbivorous gastropod, which was associated with the consumption of energy-enriched food (i.e. algae). This discovery suggests that boosted energy transfer may not only compensate for the energetic burden of ocean acidification but also enable calcifiers to build energetically costly shells that are robust to acidified conditions. We unlock a possible mechanism underlying the persistence of calcifiers in acidifying oceans.

TI  - Significant reduction of carbon stocks and changes of ecosystem service valuation of Indian Sundarban
AB  - The Sundarban mangrove or tidal influenced natural ecosystem is extremely productive and providing multiple goods and services to millions of people. In the last few decades, the quality and quantity of mangrove ecosystem are being deteriorated. The main objectives of this current research are (i) to investigate the ecosystem service values (ESVs) using a time series satellite data (1975, 2000 and 2020) and different unit values (ii) to analyze the dynamic pattern of carbon sequestration through InVEST model and (iii) determination of ESVs change hotspots by Getis-Ord Gi* method. Here, mangrove forest has the highest ecosystem service value and highest carbon sinker. The total loss of ESVs was estimated 3310.79 million USD during last 45Â years in Sundarban Biosphere Reserve (SBR) due to high natural and anthropogenic adversities. InVEST model also revealed that the total static carbon storage over the study area was 48.87, 46.65 and 43.33 Tg for the year 1975, 2000 and 2020 respectively. Total 6313944Â mg/6.31Tg loss of carbon has been observed in the case of mangrove forest during the overall study period (1975â€“2020). So, illegal human encroachment should be strictly (through law and regulations) restricted within Sundarban mangrove ecosystem for the benefits of people. Â© 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Improvement of Mooring Configurations in Geraldton Harbour
AB  - Ports exposed to high energy long wave conditions can experience significantly reduced berth operability. Geraldton is perhaps one of the best known examples. Recent studies to mitigate the problems have concentrated on the reduction of the long waves by extending the breakwater. However, this is quite costly. Various countermeasures related to the mooring configuration are defined and analysed in this paper. The analysed alternatives are use of shore-based mooring lines, installation of softer fenders, a combination of these two, and deployment of Cavotec MoorMaster (TM) units. These alternatives were compared with the existing mooring configuration and with the option to extend the breakwater. The best improvement (50\% increase of threshold long wave height inside the harbour) is reached by installing a combination of pneumatic fenders and constant tension winches set to 30 t, or nylon breast lines on a brake winch with a pretension of 25 t. In this way, the vessel is pulled into the fenders and fender friction prevents excessive surging of the ship along the berth.

TI  - ETH-HCRAW a cost effective flexible pipe for active heating
AB  - To address flow assurance challenges, Integrated Production Bundle (ETH-IPB) and Heating Cables Replacing Armour Wires (ETH-HCRAW) have been developed. These two technologies use electrical cables, which provide heat to the fluid by Joule effect. They are different in their design, efficiency and cost, and thus on their application domains. This paper details the design, the qualification and the identified envelop of use of the ETH-HCRAW. The pioneer flexible pipe with active heating technology was ETH-HCRAW, i.e. flexible pipe with electrical cables integrated in the tensile armour layers for active heating and such application is developed in the paper. The integration of the active heating in the flexible and the terminations is presented. The overall qualification of this technology is described considering two different levels. Firstly, the qualification of the components of the electrical system through extensive electrical and mechanical tests is developed. Then, the global mechanical behavior and the reliability of the overall system are demonstrated by a phase of full scale tests. Such solution based on integrated electrical cables has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective technology for active heating on flexible pipe through dedicated R&D development back in the early 2000's. This paper presents the latest developments that enable to position the ETH-HCRAW technology as leading solution for active heating with the advantages of flexible pipes. ETH-HCRAW facilitates the exploitation of deep water projects and long tie back by limiting the temperature losses along the lines. Active heating, by increasing the temperature of the fluid, enhances flow assurance for complex and viscous fluids by reducing the viscosity and reduces wax appearance in the lines. Finally, this technology tackles the formation of hydrates by maintaining a minimum temperature during shut down and start-up phases allowing to remain outside the hydrate formation conditions. ETH-HCRAW is an attractive and cost effective active heating solution with a broad possible domain of application. This technology offers many advantages in terms of flexibility of operation especially for hydrate and wax management. This paper details the numerous advantages and the limitations of this technology compared to other active heating technologies. Copyright 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - â€˜Swinging on the anchorâ€™: The difficulties in achieving greenhouse gas abatement in shipping via virtual arrival
AB  - The abatement of greenhouse gas emissions represents a major global challenge and an important topic for transportation research. Several studies have argued that energy efficiency measures for virtual arrival and associated reduced anchorage time can significantly reduce emissions from ships by allowing for speed reduction on passage. However, virtual arrival is uncommon in shipping. In this paper, we examine the causes for waiting time for ships at anchor and the limited uptake of virtual arrival. We show the difficulties associated with the implementation of virtual arrival and explain why shipping is unlikely to achieve the related abatement potential as assumed by previous studies. Combining onboard observations with seafarers and interviews with both sea-staff and shore-based operational personnel we show how charterersâ€™ commercial priorities outweigh the fuel saving benefits associated with virtual arrival. Moreover, we demonstrate how virtual arrival systems have unintended, negative consequences for seafarers in the form of fatigue. Our findings have implications for the IMO's greenhouse gas abatement goals. Â© 2019

TI  - In situ spectrophotometric measurement of dissolved inorganic carbon in seawater
AB  - Autonomous in situ sensors are needed to document the effects of today's rapid ocean uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (e.g., ocean acidification). General environmental conditions (e.g., biofouling, turbidity) and carbon-specific conditions (e.g., wide diel variations) present significant challenges to acquiring long-term measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with satisfactory accuracy and resolution. SEAS-DIC is a new in situ instrument designed to provide calibrated, high-frequency, long-term measurements of DIC in marine and fresh waters. Sample water is first acidified to convert all DIC to carbon dioxide (CO2). The sample and a known reagent solution are then equilibrated across a gas-permeable membrane. Spectrophotometric measurement of reagent pH can thereby determine the sample DIC over a wide dynamic range, with inherent calibration provided by the pH indicator's molecular characteristics. Field trials indicate that SEAS-DIC performs well in biofouling and turbid waters, with a DIC accuracy and precision of âˆ¼2 Î¼mol kg-1 and a measurement rate of approximately once per minute. The acidic reagent protects the sensor cell from biofouling, and the gas-permeable membrane excludes particulates from the optical path. This instrument, the first spectrophotometric system capable of automated in situ DIC measurements, positions DIC to become a key parameter for in situ CO 2-system characterizations.

TI  - Efforts and experiences, developing deepwater projects in Brazil
AB  - Petrobras, as the largest operator in ultra-deep waters in South America, has been using a field development concept that has proved to be winner since 2010. This concept is well suited for fields with high productivity wells, which produce more than 20,000 barrels of oil per day. In the market, this concept is known as â€œsatellite wellsâ€. In this scenario, Petrobras has benefited from its strategy of standardizing subsea equipment, including Wet Christmas Trees (WCT), Flexible Pipes, Umbilicals and Subsea Manifolds. However, since the downturn of 2014, Petrobras has been struggling to simplify its own specifications, looking for the most attractive CAPEX solutions in the market, allowing suppliers to use their own knowledge and experiences to propose low cost solutions, meeting projects requirements. From 2015 onwards, Petrobras has been working with the suppliers, with the Early Engagement initiative, aiming that the integration synergies, existing assets and the experience of these suppliers, could bring to the projects, the benefits of CAPEX reduction, and allowing the advancement and approval of these projects internally in the company. Technological development programs to allow the use of flexible pipes that are resistant to contaminants such as CO2 and H2S, new CRA materials to be applied to rigid flowlines and low-cost riser configurations, have been pursued by Petrobras in order to enable the implementation of ultra-deep water projects.

TI  - y Plasticity in the Above- and Below-Ground Development of Mangrove Seedlings in Response to Variation in Soil Bulk Density
AB  - Mangroves store large amounts of organic carbon (C) in their soils and are important in the global C cycle. These C stocks have been attributed to the below-ground productivity of mangroves, yet there is limited knowledge about the environmental factors that influence mangrove root growth. Thus, this study aimed to assess the role of variation in soil bulk density (BD) on the early development of mangroves. Seedlings of four mangrove species were grown in a pot-experiment in soils with a BD ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 g cm(-3). Nine functional above- and below-ground plant traits were measured. Above- and below-ground traits of mangrove seedlings were influenced by variation in soil BD, but the effect was species specific. The reaction norms for most plant traits of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Rhizophora stylosa suggested a growth optimum at a specific soil BD (0.6 and 0.4 g cm(-3), respectively), whilst the reaction norm of Avicennia marina was highly variable among traits, and Ceriops australis showed a very limited response. Moreover, A. marina was the most plastic species above-ground, while R. stylosa was the most plastic species below-ground. Ceriops australis was the least plastic species. Hence, soil BD is an environmental factor that influences mangrove root traits and seedling establishment, and may therefore affect mangrove species distributions and ecosystem C stocks.

TI  - CLIMATE CHANGE EFFECTS ON FRUIT QUALITY AND POST-HARVEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
AB  - Climate change is taking place due to industrial emission of green house gases (GHG), use of fossil fuels, deforestation, and destruction of vegetation and extensive construction activities. This is destroying ecosystem, natural hydrological cycle and affecting ground water recharges. Climate change is causing rise in temperature, erratic rainfall, increased wind velocity and lower RH. These changes are resulting in scarring, sunburn and poor color development in apple, apricots, cherries and many other fruits. Climate change is likely to alter the balance between insect-pests and their natural enemies and this may increase blemishes on fruit and percentage of cull fruit. Any increase in temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and plant canopy growth would increase incidence of Botrytis bunch rot in grapes. Rains and cloudy weather just before harvest can increase post-harvest spoilage in all the fruits. Wind and insect scarring affect fruit quality and fruit become unmarketable. Evaporative cooling of fruit on trees through sprinklers and Sunburn protectant spray can reduce sunburn in apple,that is, 0.2\% sunburn in treated fruit as compared to 10.8\% in control. Frost damages have been reported in Aonla and Ber due to unusual low temperatures in northwest India. After chilling temperatures at maturity, postharvest losses in avocado have increased. In mandarins grown under higher temperatures, color development is poor with less acidity while rains and hailstorms during maturity increased postharvest losses. Rains have increased losses in acid lime due to rotting and splitting. With increasing temperature due to climate change, cold chain has become unavoidable and it is must. Higher market standards of importing countries may also lead to wastage as produce that does not meet size, shape or appearance criteria has to be disposed of at throw away prices. Airfreighted fruit has more carbon footprint and may face trade-barrier and sea-freight protocols need to be developed. Green and ecofriendly postharvest technologies will help mitigate warming impact. Changing conditions demand orientation of postharvest strategy to improve infrastructure to reduce losses and increase availability of produce. Utilization of damaged fruit, strengthening of processing infrastructure, and cottage scale and home scale processing need to be strengthened. Several issues about postharvest research, policy and development need rethinking and action in the face of climatic change that are going to affect our lives in coming decades.

TI  - Variability of the thermohaline structure of a coastal hypersaline lagoon and the implications for salinity gradient energy harvesting
AB  - Natural and artificial systems containing water resources that have different salinities can be used to generate salinity-gradient energy (SGE). In this paper, the feasibility of implementing SGE in hypersaline coastal lagoons is addressed, taking the coastal lagoon La Carbonera in Yucatan, Mexico, as an exemplary case. A realistic approach to the exploitation conditions and potential that could occur in a SGE plant in these ecosystems is presented. We first analyzed the variability of salinity and temperature in the three characteristic zones of the coastal lagoon and the correlation of these variables with atmospheric forcing. This was done using 1 year records of in situ measurements. Then the theoretical potential for SGE and the intra-annual variability of that potential were assessed considering the three possible harvesting configurations of mixing among fresh, sea, and hypersaline water. Results show that the thermohaline structure may vary significantly for the three locations at different time scales (diurnal to seasonal) depending on the tides, winds, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and solar radiation. That suggests that the highest annual energy yield would be obtained from alternating throughout the year among the mixing configurations, depending on the specific seasonal thermohaline structure of the lagoon.

TI  - Propeller selection optimization on mini LNG ship based on engine propeller matching approach
AB  - Mini LNG Carrier Ship is specially designed for the purpose of distributing Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) throughout Indonesia and supporting the national program of generating 35.00 MegaWatt (MW). Indonesiaâ€™s vast territory with long distances requires an efficient transportation, including Mini LNG Carrier Ship to reduce costs, especially fuel and emission levels that meet the EEDI criteria set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). One of the efficiency factors of Mini LNG Ship Carrier is obtained by optimizing the design, especially to the propulsion system. The propulsion system consists of the main engine and propeller. This study focuses on the selection of ship propulsion propellers, especially the type and number of propeller blades. The good propeller will have an impact on the level of energy efficiency. The research method used is a computational simulation using the Engine Propeller Matching (EPM) method. The study tested the B-Series propeller with an alternative number of propeller blades are (z) = 3, 4, 5, 6, and. 7. Calculating simulation results show that the analysis of the EPM computational results at 10 knots service speed, shows that the B6.40 propeller has a better efficiency value than the other propeller types (z = 3, 4, 5, and 7). Propeller type B6.40 produces a good level of efficiency according to the planned 2 x 250 KW engine performance diagram. Â© 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

TI  - Study on spm mooring system for side-by-side two vessels
AB  - In this paper, a new side-by-side mooring bay designed by Keppel Offshore & Marine Technology Centre is investigated, and its global performance and dynamic stability are compared against those of the traditional SPM-mooring system. The multi-body systems include SPM buoy with a turntable and mooring system, a VLCC FPSO, oil tanker, and the hawsers/fenders and yokes between them. A time-domain vessel-mooring-coupled dynamic analysis computer program is used to simulate their respective responses and relative displacements in collinear, relatively mild random wave and current environment assuming that the system is to be operated in a protected bay area. In the analyses of both systems, time-domain results of the responses, the corresponding spectra, and the summary of statistics are presented. It shows that the newly-designed SPM mooring system experiences smaller relative motions between vessels and is more stable in the same environment compared to the traditional SPM mooring system.

TI  - Risk assessment of abandoned wells affected by CO2
AB  - Flawless operation during injection and a long-term seal of the storage reservoir after injection are the prerequisites for successful CO2 storage in the geological subsurface. This requires the sealing of the porous permeable horizons by a tight caprock and long-term integrity of open and abandoned wells which have penetrated these horizons. As a basic requirement for the inception of a CO2 injection scheme in any sequestration project, the integrity of the existing wells in the field must be proven. This paper reviews the relevant items including the geology, relevant wells and their standards, well integrity, and integrity evaluation methods. At the end, a novel concept is introduced to evaluate well integrity for abandoned wells. It is concluded that the verification of technical well integrity is significantly more difficult for abandoned wells, because measurements and tests to close information gaps are no longer possible. If information is lacking for a direct assessment, the quantification of the risk of leakage is only possible indirectly. For an indirect assessment, a realistic risk assessment should consider the composite system casing-cement-rock as a whole and also include self-healing caused by CO2 interaction with the composite system and/or the indigenous rock. The proposed new method covers both qualitative and quantitative analysis, and it is more comprehensive, sophisticated and easier to implement.

TI  - Optimum frequency of power generation on offshore platforms
AB  - For most large North Sea platforms, all electrical power is generated on board employing gas turbine generators. In the early days, fuel gas was plentiful and all design considerations focused on weight and space saving, hence cost. To-day, fuel gas has a substantial value and heating loads are generally supplied by turbine exhaust gas waste heat recovery equipment. Now, the major power consumers are items of rotating equipment such as large pumps and compressors and drivers can either be electric motor or gas turbine. Further reduction in platform fuel consumption, once the process parameters/design is fixed, can only be obtained by optimising the design of this rotating equipment. Here the use of high frequency power generation (100/120Hz) is considered to improve system efficiency as it will enable components to operate at peak conditions yet eliminate transmission losses. This approach can also provide substantial space and weight savings as higher frequency components tend to be smaller than their low frequency counterparts.

TI  - Participatory process for marine spatial planning: perception of Mar del Plata's residents on offshore hydrocarbon exploration in the North Argentina Basin (Argentina)
AB  - Offshore hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation are activities developed internationally in the advance of the energy industry. Conflicts generated by incompatibility with others or with social actors, make the approach from Marine Spatial Planning necessary. In Argentina, although it is a process that has been developing since the middle of the 20th century, it was not until 2014 when the National Government promoted the activity. The North Argentine Basin (NAB) constitutes a hydrocarbon exploration area that was delimited in 2018 by Resolution 65/2018. This activity in the NAB has given rise to conflicts between intervening social actors, which was manifested in the Public Hearing (AP1/21) held in July 2021. That is why the objective of this work was to analyze the results of the AP1/21 and contrast them with the opinion of Mar del Plata's residents. For this, 682 semi-open surveys were carried out, where they were asked about the activity and the AP1/21. As a result, it was obtained that 373 people were expressed in favor (4\%) and against (96\%) of the project. Topics such as climate change, energy planning, and disagreement with the steps of the participatory process and the environmental impact study were presented. In the case of the surveys, opinions similar to those expressed in the audience were found, corroborating results and conclusions between both processes. In summary, the work allowed us to know not only the opinion of Mar del Plata's population but also the type of information available on the economic activity analyzed.

TI  - Offshore fresh groundwater in coastal unconsolidated sediment systems as a potential fresh water source in the 21st century
AB  - Coastal areas worldwide are often densely populated and host regional agricultural and industrial hubs. Strict water quality requirements for agricultural, industrial and domestic use are regularly not satisfied by surface waters in coastal areas and consequently lead to over-exploitation of local fresh groundwater resources. Additional pressure by both climate change and population growth further intensifies the upcoming water stress and raise the urgency to search for new fresh water sources. In recent years, offshore fresh groundwater (OFG) reserves have been identified as such a potential water source. In this study, we quantify, for the first time, the global volume of OFG in unconsolidated coastal aquifers using numerical groundwater models. Our results confirm previously reported widespread presence of OFG along the global coastline. Furthermore, we find that these reserves are likely non-renewable resources mostly deposited during glacial periods when sea levels were substantially lower compared to current sea level. We estimate the total OFG volume in unconsolidated coastal aquifers to be approximately 1.06 0.2 million km3, which is roughly three times more than estimated previously and about 10% of all terrestrial fresh groundwater. With extensive active and inactive offshore oil pumping present in areas of large OFG reserves, they could be considered for temporary fresh groundwater exploration as part of a transition to sustainable water use in coastal areas on the long run.

TI  - Application of Optical Fiber Sensing Technology in Offshore Platform Structure Monitoring
AB  - With increasing service life of offshore platform, the platform components have different degrees of damage and aging. In order to ensure the safety of offshore platform, the structure monitoring need to be implemented. The optical fiber sensing network is composed of FBG(Fiber Bragg Grating) accelerometers, FBG strain sensors, and FBG tilt sensors. The sensing network is used to monitor the displacement, bearing load of pile end, and uneven settlement of offshore platform. The results show that the use of optical fiber sensing technology for offshore platform structure monitoring is a feasible and effective method. This paper is greatly significant for ensuring the safety of offshore platform.
