TI  - Hybrid ship unit commitment with demand prediction and model predictive control
AB  - We present a novel methodology for the control of power unit commitment in complex ship energy systems. The usage of this method is demonstrated with a case study, where measured data was used from a cruise ship operating in the Caribbean and the Mediterranean. The shipâ€™s energy system is conceptualized to feature a fuel cell and a battery along standard diesel generating sets for the purpose of reducing local emissions near coasts. The developed method is formulated as a model predictive control (MPC) problem, where a novel 2-stage predictive model is used to predict power demand, and a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is used to solve unit commitment according to the prediction. The performance of the methodology is compared to fully optimal control, which was simulated by optimizing unit commitment for entire measured power demand profiles of trips. As a result, it can be stated that the developed methodology achieves close to optimal unit commitment control for the conceptualized energy system. Furthermore, the predictive model is formulated so that it returns probability estimates of future power demand rather than point estimates. This opens up the possibility for using stochastic or robust optimization methods for unit commitment optimization in future studies. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Ocean acidification may be increasing the intensity of lightning over the oceans
AB  - The anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2 is not only considered to drive global warming, but also ocean acidification. Previous studies have shown that acidification will affect many aspects of biogenic carbon uptake and release in the surface water of the oceans. In this report we present a potential novel impact of acidification on the flash intensity of lightning discharged into the oceans. Our experimental results show that a decrease in ocean pH corresponding to the predicted increase in atmospheric CO2 according to the IPCC RCP 8.5 worst case emission scenario, may increase the intensity of lightning discharged into seawater by approximately 30 Â± 7% by the end of the twenty-first century relative to 2000.

TI  - Enhanced carbonate and silicate weathering accelerates recovery from fossil fuel CO2 perturbations
AB  - Increasing atmospheric CO2 and surface temperatures should increase carbonate and silicate weathering rates, directly via warming, and indirectly via the CO2 fertilization effect enhancing plant productivity. Enhanced weathering should in turn increase alkalinity input to the ocean and accelerate long-term CO2 uptake. We added silicate and carbonate weathering and carbonate sediments to an existing global carbon cycle and surface temperature model and subjected it to a range of long-term fossil fuel emissions scenarios, spanning 1100-15,000 GtC in total. Emissions ofâ‰¥7350 GtC dissolve all carbonate sediments, and enhanced carbonate and silicate weathering accelerate subsequent CO2 removal from the atmosphere by up to a factor of 4. For 1100-4000 GtC emissions, enhanced weathering accelerates CO2 removal by a factor of 1.5-2.5. However, it takes &gt;1 Myr for silicate weathering to stabilize atmospheric CO 2. If land use tends to suppress vegetation and weathering rates on this timescale, then CO2 will stabilize above preindustrial levels. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.

TI  - Waste sea shells for biodiesel production-current status and future perspective
AB  - Imbalance in supply and huge demand for energy in India made researchers and industrialists develop alternative fuels. This increasing energy demand can be resolved by utilizing fossil fuels, but they are non-biodegradable and cause global warming. Biodiesel is a promising alternative which is biodegradable, renewable, non-toxic and mitigates global warming. Transesterification reaction was employed commonly to produce biodiesel. Exploiting homogeneous catalysts for biodiesel production makes the biodiesel separation and purification process more complicated. Thus, the current research focuses on the development of heterogeneous catalysts, which engulf the difficulties caused by homogeneous catalysts. Currently, waste shell materials are utilized for the development of heterogeneous catalysts, thereby reducing the cost involved in using commercially available catalysts and the environmental impacts caused by disposing the waste sea shells. The catalytic activity of calcium oxide (CaO) catalyst derived from the waste shells is low and hence, several modification techniques are employed to enhance its catalytic activity. This paper mainly discusses the modification techniques used in the preparation of CaO catalyst from different waste shells and its application in biodiesel production. It also summarizes the characterization results such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis of different sea shells. Furthermore, the issues involved in using CaO as a catalyst and major developments in current research to overcome such issues were also discussed. Overall, the present review showed that the waste sea shells have huge potential to develop a prodigiously active catalyst for biodiesel production. Â© 2020 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - POLYSACCHARIDE ADDITION EFFECTS ON RHIZOSPHERE NITROGEN FIXATION RATES OF THE CALIFORNIA CORDGRASS, SPARTINA FOLIOSA
AB  - Low nutrient availability in salt marsh ecosystems can potentially limit primary productivity and subsequent carbon export to coastal waters. In temperate marshes with low external nitrogen inputs, nitrogen (N(2)) fixation may enhance availability of usable nitrogen to marsh plant communities and increase their growth. The effects of sub-surface soil amendment of polysaccharides on rhizosphere N(2) fixation, and on plant growth and tissue characteristics of the California cordgrass, Spartina foliosa, were tested in microcosms in a tidal simulator. Polysaccharide was added as alginate extract, and rhizosphere N(2) fixation and plant characteristics were measured over 9 weeks. N(2) fixation rates increased 10-fold in the alginate treatment compared to controls after 1 week of exposure as a result of increased availability of a readily usable form of carbon. N(2) fixation rates in amended sediment were significantly higher than rates in control sediments at weeks 1 and 3. Although plant characteristics did not differ between treatments, trends of increased number of leaves and shoots in amended plants compared to controls appeared between weeks 7 and 9. The potential for increased plant growth following an increase in N(2) fixation rates warrants further investigation as it may have implications for recovery of N-limited disturbed and restored salt marshes.

TI  - Will restored mangrove forests enhance sediment organic carbon and ecosystem carbon storage?
AB  - Mangrove forests are among the largest carbon (C) sinks in (sub) tropical areas, playing a vital role in reducing C emissions. However, these forests have degraded rapidly in recent decades due to various human activities and natural disturbances. Thus, mangrove restoration programs have been widely initiated to prevent further forest loss and to mitigate climate change. The measurement of ecosystem C storage in restored mangrove forests will provide crucial information for the temporal reporting of C emissions in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) schemes. The question whether restored mangrove forests enhance sediment organic carbon (OC) and ecosystem C storage has not been resolved for mangrove restoration programs. The present study, therefore, aimed to quantify ecosystem C storage and the contribution of organic matter sources to sedimentary OC in Kandelia obovata forests aged 9, 19 and 27 years; Sonneratia caseolaris forests aged 2 and 3 years, and a reference mudflat forest aged 0 from Hau Loc, North-Central Vietnam. The mean above- and below-ground C stocks of these forests ranged from 12.7 +/- 2.4 to 107.5 +/- 10.7 MgC ha(-1), and 103.8 +/- 2.9 to 412.4 +/- 6.5 MgC ha(-1), respectively. The ecosystem C storage of mangrove forests tended to increase with stand age, ranging from 201.3 +/- 4.3 to 519.9 +/- 12.5 MgC ha(-1), with an overall mean of 310.3 +/- 21.3 MgC ha(-1). The contribution of mangrove litter to sedimentary OC was between 45.8 +/- 0.8 and 64.1 +/- 1.5\% along a forest chronosequence. The increase of the OC content and ecosystem C storage, and the proportional contributions of OC sources with forest age resulted from higher biomass production following forest development and the location of stands in the intertidal zone. These findings highlighted the importance of mangrove restoration programs in enhancing the ecosystem C storage and the sediment OC. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Safety and monitoring of underground CO2 stores [Sicherheit und Ãœberwachung von CO2-Speichern]
AB  - Safe capture and underground storage of CO2 in aquifers or in depleted natural gas reservoirs (CCS) shall avoid leakage that could i) compromise the climate protection aims, ii) have negative effects on local ecosystems, and iii) threaten health and safety of staff and local population living above a CO2 store. Technical experience with the handling of CO2 and other gases in the underground demonstrates that save injection of CO2 into rock formations is manageable. However, no experience is available to proof the long-term safety of the CCS technology, for storage times of about ten thousand years or more. Corrosion of materials that have been used to seal abandoned wells is regarded as critical for the long-term integrity of CO2 storages. Leakage of fluids and gases from wells has been sealed in some cases before. Alas, the chances to seal leaking cap rocks are little. Therefore, precautionary measures are the key to long-term safe storage. These are: selection of suitable storage sites, intensive site exploration, risk analysis, emergency planning and finally geotechnical efforts to ensure an optimal sealing of any wells in the cap rocks of the reservoirs. Though, the best site selection and exploration can not guarantee that a store is absolutely tight. Thus, a close monitoring during the injection period and a less intensive monitoring of the storage after site abandonment is recommend. A variety of techniques is principally available for monitoring of CO2 storage sites on land and off-shore. However, no generally recognized concepts regarding safety requirements, site exploration needs, storage operation and monitoring obligations exist. Such concepts, for the safe underground storage of CO2, are a prerequisite for the emplacement of legal frameworks that regulate CCS. Without clear rules for industry and regulators, CCS will hardly become a widely implemented emission reduction tool.

TI  - Green and efficient configuration of integrated waste heat and cold energy recovery for marine natural gas/diesel dual-fuel engine
AB  - Energy conservation and emission reduction form a dominant theme in our time, hence, researchers urgently need to develop green and efficient technologies to adapt to new rules. To achieve the cascade utilization of waste heat and cold energy as well as meet the daily energy and life requirements of ships, a green and efficient configuration is proposed, which include the analysis and matching of supercritical and subcritical Rankine cycles, comprehensive utilization of liquefied natural gas cold energy, carbon separation and capture, and hydrocarbon adsorption. Foremost, the simulation results are compared with the literature data to verify the accuracy of the proposed integrated system. Subsequently, a point-by-point analysis of the operation parameters that affect the system performance is performed. In addition, the method for the efficient utilization of cold energy, and the contribution of quantitative cold energy are proposed. After obtaining the optimal operation conditions, the economic and thermodynamic performance of the cold energy recovery system and integrated system is calculated. The results demonstrate that the integrated system is feasible in economy and could meet the daily needs of the ship. The output work, energy efficiency, and exergy efficiency reach 270.78 kW, 26.89\% and 54.33\%, respectively. Finally, after the installation of the energy-saving technology, the system shows excellent emission reduction characteristics. Therefore, the configuration is found to be an effective implementation of a novel idea for energy conservation and emission reduction.

TI  - Carbon gas production under different electron acceptors in a freshwater marsh soil
AB  - Dynamics of carbon (C) gas emission from wetlands influence global C cycling. In many freshwater systems such as Louisiana freshwater marsh, soil contents of NO3- and SO42 - have increased due to nutrient loading and saltwater intrusion. This could affect C mineralization and the emission of the major greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). In this investigation, a laboratory microcosm study was carried out to elucidate the effects of NO3- and SO42 - on CO2 and CH4 production from a freshwater marsh soil located in the Barataria Basin of Louisiana coast, which has been subjected to the Mississippi River diversion and seawater intrusion. Composite soil samples were collected from top 50 cm marsh profile, treated with different levels of NO3- (0, 3.2 and 5 mM) or SO42 - (0, 2, and 5 mM) concentrations, and incubated for 214 d under anaerobic conditions. The results showed that the presence of NO3- (especially at 3.2 mM) significantly decreased CO2 productions whereas SO42 - did not. On the other hand, both NO3- and SO42 - treatments decreased CH4 production but the NO3- almost completely inhibited CH4 production (&gt;99%) whereas the SO42 - treatments reduced CH4 production by 78-90%. The overall C mineralization rate constant under the NO3- presence was also low. In addition, the results revealed that a large proportion (95%) of anaerobic carbon mineralization in the untreated freshwater soil was unexplained by the reduction of any of the measured major electron acceptors.

TI  - Developing an integrated hybrid polygeneration system combined with utility steam network
AB  - In this study, an integrated hybrid polygeneration system based on solar and biogas energy is developed for simultaneous heat and power generation and hydrogen production. A heat recovery system is employed, which can recover the waste heat from the flue gas for effective utilisation in the steam network. The devised system, comprising solar, biogas, chemical, steam, and power islands, is investigated and comparatively evaluated through energy and exergy approaches. Additionally, an optimisation study is carried out to find the optimal exergy efficiency. The findings suggest that integrating the steam island and hybrid system improved the overall system performance significantly.

TI  - Invasive cordgrass (Spartina spp.) in south-eastern Australia induces island formation, salt marsh development, and carbon storage
AB  - Invasive vegetation species can lead to major changes in the geomorphology of coastal systems. Within temperate estuaries in the southern hemisphere, especially Australia and New Zealand, the cordgrass Spartina spp. has become established. These species are highly invasive, and their prolific growth leads to the development of supratidal environments in formerly intertidal and subtidal environments. Here, we quantified the impact of Spartina invasion on the geomorphology and sequestration capacity of carbon in the sediments of Anderson Inlet, Victoria, Australia. Spartina was first introduced to the area in the 1930s to aid in land reclamation and control coastal erosion associated with coastal development. We found that Spartina now dominates the intertidal areas of the Inlet and promotes accretion (18mm/year) causing the formation of over 108ha of supratidal islands over the past 100years. These newly formed islands are calculated to potentially contain over 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent carbon. Future management of the inlet and other Spartina-dominated environments within Australian presents a dilemma for resource managers; on the one hand, Spartina is highly invasive and can outcompete native tidal marshes, thereby warranting its eradication, but on the other hand it is likely more resilient to rising sea levels and has the potential for carbon sequestration. Whether or not the potential advantages outweigh the significant habitat change that is anticipated, any management strategies will likely require additional research into costs and benefits of all ecosystem services provided by Spartina including in relation to nutrient cycling, shoreline stabilisation, and biodiversity as well as in response to the longevity of carbon found within the sediments.

TI  - Implication of Land-Use and Land-Cover Change into Carbon Dioxide Emissions in Karang Gading and Langkat Timur Wildlife Reserve, North Sumatra, Indonesia
AB  - Mangrove forest in the context of climate change is important sector to be included in the inventory of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The present study describes land-use and land-cover change during 2006-2012 of a mangrove forest conservation area, Karang Gading and Langkat Timur Laut Wildlife Reserve (KGLTLWR) in North Sumatra, Indonesia and their implications to carbon dioxide emissions. A land-use change matrix showed that the decrease of mangrove forest due to increases of other land-use such as aquaculture (50.00\%) and oil palm plantation (28.83\%). Furthermore, the net cumulative of carbon emissions in KGLTLWR for 2006 was 3804.70 t CO2-eq year(-1), whereas predicting future emissions in 2030 was 11,318.74 t CO2-eq year(-1) or an increase of 33.61\% for 12 years. Source of historical emissions mainly from changes of secondary mangrove forests into aquaculture and oil palm plantation were 3223.9 t CO2-eq year(-1) (84.73\%) and 959.00 t CO2-eq year(-1) (25.21\%), respectively, indicating that the KGLTLWR is still a GHG emitter. Mitigation scenario with no conversion in secondary mangrove forest reduced 16.21\% and 25.8\% carbon emissions in 2024 and 2030, respectively. This study suggested that aquaculture and oil palm plantation are drivers of deforestation as well as the largest of GHG emission source in this area.

TI  - DESIGNING OFFSHORE PIPELINE SAFETY SYSTEMS UTILISING FLOW AND PRESSURE IN MULTI DESIGN PRESSURE PIPELINE SYSTEMS
AB  - The Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) has been a main arena for development of subsea pipeline technology over the last 25 years. The pipeline infrastructure in the North Sea is well developed and new field developments are often tied in to existing pipeline systems, /3/. Codes traditionally require a pipeline system to be designed with a uniform design pressure. However, due to the pressure drop when transporting gas in a very long pipeline, it is possible to operate multi design pressure systems. The pipeline integrity is ensured by limiting the inventory and local maximum allowable pressure in the pipeline using inlet and outlet pressure measurements in a Safety Instrumented System (SIS). Any blockage in the pipeline could represent a demand on the safety system. This concept was planned to be used in the new Gjoa development when connecting the 130 km long rich gas pipeline to the existing 450 km long FLAGS pipeline system. However, a risk assessment detected a new risk parameter; the formation of a hydrate and subsequent blockage of the pipeline. In theory, the hydrate could form in any part of the pipeline. Therefore, the pipeline outlet pressure could not be used in a Safety Instrumented System to control pipeline inventory. The export pressure at Gjoa would therefore be limited to FLAGS pipeline code. Available pressure drop over the Gjoa pipeline was hence limited and a large diameter was necessary. Various alternatives were investigated; using signals from neighbour installations, subsea remote operated valves, subsea pressure sensors and even a riser platform. These solutions gave high risk, reduced availability, high operating and/or capital expenses. A new idea of introducing flow measurement in the SIS was proposed. Hydraulic simulations showed that when the parameters of flow, temperature and pressure, all located at the offshore installation, were used; a downstream blockage could be detected early. This enabled the topside export pressure to be increased, and thereby reduced the pipeline diameter required. Flow measurement in Safety Instrumented Systems has not been used previously on the NCS. This paper describes the principles of designing a pipeline safety system including flow measurement with focus on the hydraulic simulations and designing the safety system. Emphasis will be put on improvements in transportation efficiency, cost reductions and operational issues. Copyright (C) 2008 by ASME

TI  - Role of marine biology in glacial-interglacial CO2 cycles
AB  - It has been hypothesized that changes in the marine biological pump caused a major portion of the glacial reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 80 to 100 parts per million through increased iron fertilization of marine plankton, increased ocean nutrient content or utilization, or shifts in dominant plankton types. We analyze sedimentary records of marine productivity at the peak and the middle of the last glacial cycle and show that neither changes in nutrient utilization in the Southern Ocean nor shifts in plankton dominance explain the CO2 drawdown. Iron fertilization and associated mechanisms can be responsible for no more than half the observed drawdown.

TI  - Does Regional Development Influence Sedimentary Blue Carbon Stocks? A Case Study From Three Australian Estuaries
AB  - Mitigating climate change through the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels is of interest, particularly through maintaining and re-establishing natural ecosystems that act as carbon sinks, such as coastal vegetated habitats or ``blue carbon{''} systems. Here we compare sedimentary blue carbon (C) stocks from 37 sediment cores collected in pristine (n = 13), agricultural (n = 11), and urban (n = 13) estuaries within the same geomorphological region, located on the eastern coast of Australia. The mean estimated C stocks for each carbon system (seagrass, mangrove, and saltmarshes) were 402 +/- 78, 830 +/- 109, and 723 +/- 100 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, conservatively estimated up to 3 m depths. Analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between C stocks per area (C ha(-1)) considering each habitat type and between specific estuaries. However, the total estuarine C stocks were found to be greater with increasing levels of conservation, based on larger areas of blue carbon vegetation. The potential loss of C to the atmosphere from these small regional estuaries are 500,574 +/- 118,635 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e), based on specific assumptions. The implication of these results are that there are large C stocks in small regional estuaries which supports the protection of blue C systems in developing coastal areas and highlights the uncertainties of the CO2 emissions from potential blue C habitat degradation.

TI  - Modeling of an underwater drilling platform for very near shore applications
AB  - The development of the blue economy involves the construction of marine infrastructures (harbors, marine wind farms, underwater data centers, etc.). All these activities require a geological investigation of the sea bottom. For nearshore and very near-shore applications the most common solution is represented by the adoption of fixed jack-up platforms; however, transportation and deployment of this kind of infrastructure are quite expensive and time-consuming. Also, the adoption of floating drilling technologies that are currently used for offshore applications is often difficult or impossible in shallow waters. In this work, an underwater drilling platform designed for near-shore applications is investigated. The proposed system is designed and optimized for rapid deployment in different operational conditions. This work is focused on the description of this innovative solution including simulation models that have been developed for this activity. Also, simulation models represent an original contribution because they are able to simulate complex interactions of the drilling pod with the surrounding water, with the support ship and with the excavated sea bottom.

Using data collected by the authors, five different food production systems involving both agriculture and aquaculture in the coastal area of Bangladesh were studied. In particular, Bagda (shrimp), Bagda-rice, rice, Galda (prawn)-rice vegetable, and traditional practice-based agricultural systems were thoroughly investigated. The findings revealed that the Galda (prawn)-rice-vegetable-based integrated agricultural system was the most energy-efficient system and released less CO2 than the other four systems.

TI  - Natural seagrass tribopositive material based spray coatable triboelectric nanogenerator
AB  - For the first time, this paper proposes natural seagrass based prominent ocean flowering and bio-friendly material for triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) through a simple spray coating technique. Herein, two different seagrass species (Zostera marina and Phyllospadix japonicus) are effectively applied as a tribopositive material. Furthermore, spray coatable Phyllospadix japonicus seagrass film/PET TENG yields a higher power density of 70.42 mu W/cm2 compared to Zostera marina seagrass film/PET TENG of 50.42 mu W/cm2 because of the higher oxygen functional groups, which enables the device to offer increased electron-donating capability. Moreover, the output performance of the proposed spray coatable TENG device improved by about 31\% compared to powder-based seagrass film. Furthermore, the Phyllospadix japonicus based TENG presents the extraordinary working stability up to 72,000 cycles (2 h), which confirms the excellent robustness of the fabricated device. It is further demonstrated that the proposed Phyllospadix japonicus based TENG can easily charge various commercial capacitors and capable of driving about 150 light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and other microelectronic devices. We anticipate that by applying seagrass as a tribopositive layer, the proposed spray coatable TENG device will serve its promising role for energy generation with extremely low fabrication cost. Furthermore, in addition to the economic use of seagrass as a TENG, this work can favorably contribute to sustainable seagrass management.

TI  - A Model of the Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Soil Carbon Following Coastal Wetland Loss Applied to a Louisiana Salt Marsh in the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain
AB  - The potential for carbon sequestration in coastal wetlands is high due to protection of carbon (C) in flooded soils. However, excessive flooding can result in the conversion of the vegetated wetland to open water. This transition results in the loss of wetland habitat in addition to the potential loss of soil carbon. Thus, in areas experiencing rapid wetland submergence, such as the Mississippi River Delta, coastal wetlands could become a significant source of carbon emissions if land loss is not mitigated. To accurately assess the capacity of wetlands to store (or emit) carbon in dynamic environments, it is critical to understand the fate of soil carbon following the transition from vegetated wetland to open water. We developed a simple soil carbon model representing soil depths to 1Â m using the data collected from a Louisiana coastal salt marsh in the Mississippi River Deltaic Plain to predict soil carbon density and stock following the transition from a vegetated salt marsh to an open water pond. While immediate effects of ponding on the distribution of carbon within the 1-m soil profile were apparent, there were no effects of ponding on the overall, integrated, carbon stocks 14Â years, following wetland submergence. Rather, the model predicts that soil carbon losses in the first meter will be realized over long periods of time (âˆ¼200Â years) due to changes in the source of carbon (biomass vs. mineral sediment) with minimal losses through mineralization.

We use an ocean general circulation and biogeochemistry model (OGCBM) to examine the impact of artificially enhanced vertical mixing on biological productivity and atmospheric CO2, as well as the climatically significant gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and dimethyl sulphide (DMS) during simulations between 2000 and 2020. Overall, we find a large increase in the amount of organic carbon exported from surface waters, but an overall increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations by 2020. We quantified the individual effect of changes in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), alkalinity and biological production on the change in pCO(2) at characteristic sites and found the increased vertical supply of carbon rich subsurface water to be primarily responsible for the enhanced CO2 outgassing, although increased alkalinity and, to a lesser degree, biological production can compensate in some regions. While ocean-atmosphere fluxes of DMS do increase slightly, which might reduce radiative forcing, the oceanic N2O source also expands. Our study has implications for understanding how natural variability in vertical mixing in different ocean regions (such as that observed recently in the Southern Ocean) can impact the ocean CO2 sink via changes in DIC, alkalinity and carbon export.

TI  - Compact High Voltage Direct Current Gas-insulated Systems
AB  - The technology of high-voltage direct current transmission (HVDC) for long-distance transportation of huge energy amounts has made its way also for grid access of offshore windfarms and interconnectors between different countries. A gas-insulated design of HVDC systems for converter and transition stations can give advantages compared to air-insulated systems. The technology of HVDC GIS helps to decrease the footprint of converter stations of onshore and even more driven by cost saving aspects of offshore installations. Using insulating gas under pressure, space requirements of HVDC switchgears can be reduced by (70... 95) %. Since both, overhead lines and underground transmission by HVDC power cables or HVDC gas-insulated lines are expected in the upcoming HVDC links and overlay networks, HVDC GIS may also be applied at transition stations between different transmission media to minimize the footprint of these stations, while integrating all relevant functionalities in gas-insulated technology. Beside the space saving aspect, the HVDC gas-insulated switchgear assemblies provide high reliability and availability, since there is no direct impact of ambient conditions like dust, salty air, ice or rain to the high-voltage parts. Today it is possible to provide gas insulated HVDC systems. The manufacturer of HVDC GIS systems has already successfully concluded the component tests and a prototype installation test.

TI  - A novel control strategy on stable operation of fuel gas supply system and reâ€liquefaction system for LNG carriers
AB  - Liquefied natural gas has attracted attention through an explosive increase in demands and environmental requirements. During this period, the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), which was adopted by the International Maritime Organization, expecting to significantly reduce CO2 from ships, has become an important key. It has triggered a change in use from steam turbine systems and dual fuel diesel electrics to highâ€efficiency main engines such as MEâ€GI engines to meet the EEDI requirements. However, since the MEâ€GI engines use 300 bar of fuel gas pressure, it is necessary to resolve problems of the pressure controllability and to prevent the reductions of the reâ€liquefaction amount caused by clogging of the lubricant mixed with the fuel gas during the compression. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel control strategy with a newly developed configuration for controlling the pressure so as not to trip the BOG compressors when the MEâ€GI engines are tripped, and for preventing a reduction on reâ€liquefaction amount. Unlike the typical configuration used in the current vessels, this proposal separately provides the fuel gas at 150 bar without lubricants to the reâ€liquefaction. In addition, three control strategies are proposed, depending upon the application of multiâ€controllers and the location of the pressure transmitters. A simulation was conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed method, focusing on the controllability of the pressure and the reâ€liquefaction amount, in comparison with the typical configuration. As results of the simulation, the proposal showed excellent controllability without trips of the BOG compressors even in abnormal conditions and confirmed the great reliquefaction performance.

TI  - Landscape configuration modulates carbon storage in seagrass sediments
AB  - Climate change has increased interest in seagrass systems as natural carbon sinks and recent studies have estimated the carbon stocks associated with seagrass meadows. However, the factors that affect their variability remain poorly understood. This paper assesses how landscape-level attributes (patch size and matrix composition) influence carbon storage in seagrass sediments. We quantified the organic carbon (C-org) content and other geochemical properties (8(13)C and particle size) in surface sediments of continuous Posidonia oceanica meadows, patchy meadows interspersed with rocky-algal reefs and patchy meadows on sedimentary bottoms. We also took samples of potential carbon sources for isotopic composition determination. Our results indicate that the continuous meadows accumulated larger amounts of Corg than patchy meadows, whether embedded in a rock or sand matrix. The Corg from continuous meadows was also more C-13 enriched, which suggests that a high proportion of the carbon was derived from plant material (autochthonous sources); in contrast in patchy meadows (especially in a sand matrix), lower 8(13)C values indicated a higher contribution from allochthonous sources (mainly suspended particulate organic matter, SPOM). These findings suggest that the sediment of continuous meadows stores more Corg in than that of patchy meadows. This is probably due to the increased contribution from seagrass leaves, which are much more refractory than SPOM. In general, certain landscape configurations, and especially patchiness, appear to reduce the carbon storage capacity of seagrasses. Since the current decline of seagrass is leading to habitat fragmentation, our results increase the argument for the promotion of effective measures to preserve the integrity of these natural carbon sinks.

TI  - A new strategic approach of energy management onboard ships supported by exergy and economic criteria: A case study of a cargo ship
AB  - The fossil-source energy consumption in maritime transportation is an important input which affects the operating costs. In this market, cargo ships with potentially represents up to 78% of the total global maritime transportation are considered as vessels with a high fossil fuel consumption. These ships need effective energy management to reduce environmental pollution from fossil fuel and to manage sustainable energy-related costs in commerce. In this study, an energy efficiency strategy framework was developed primarily to support efficient energy management as the decision support element in ships. Considering the ship's cruising processes, energy efficiency and economic effectiveness were examined as based on the exergy approach and the economic criteria. In this context, two new criteria were developed: the â€œEnvironmental Cost Index (ECI)" and the â€œEnergy Efficiency Index (EEI)". According to the analyzes results, the energy and exergy efficiencies in the sample ship's cruising processes were found as 38.33% and 35.82% respectively, and the calculated ECI was 0.41. These reference values showed that the fuel-related loss cost of the ship was 19.05%. At the end of the study, some evaluations were made on the implementation of the energy efficiency strategy and its effects. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Large Decadal Changes in Air-Sea CO2 Fluxes in the Caribbean Sea
AB  - Sixteen years of surface water CO2 data from autonomous systems on cruise ships sailing in the Caribbean Sea and Western North Atlantic show marked changes on interannual timescales. The measured changes in fugacity (approximate to partial pressure) of CO2 in surface water, fCO(2w), are based on over a million observations. Seasonally the patterns are similar to other oligotrophic subtropical regions with an amplitude of fCO(2w) of approximate to 40 mu atm with low wintertime values, causing the area to be a sink, and high summertime values making it a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. On annual scales there was negligible increase of fCO(2w) from 2002 to 2010 and a rapid increase from 2010 to 2018. Correspondingly, the trend of air-sea CO2 flux from 2002 to 2010 was strongly negative (increasing uptake or sink) at -0.05 +/- 0.01 (mol m(-2) year(-1)) year(-1) and positive (decreasing uptake) at 0.02 +/- 0.02 (mol m(-2) year(-1)) year(-1) from 2010-2018. For the whole period from 2002 to 2018, the fCO(2w) lagged the atmospheric CO2 increase by 24 \%, causing an increase in CO2 uptake. The average flux into the ocean for the 16 years is -0.20 +/- 0.16 mol m(-2) year(-1) with the uncertainty reflecting the standard deviation in annual means. The change in multiannual trend in fCO(2w) is modulated by several factors, notably changes in sea surface temperature and ocean mixed layer depth that, in turn, affected the physical and biological processes controlling fCO(2w).

TI  - Performance Efficiency of a Membrane-Type Floating Breakwater for Protection of Coastal and Offshore Facilities
AB  - A flexible box-type floating breakwater composed of a number of membrane ballasts filled with air, water and sand has been developed for wave protection of various coastal and offshore applications. The combination of ballasts of different materials would eventually result in the same draft for all the tested models, and the performance efficiency of each breakwater model was ascertained by the means of physical modelling. A total of four rectangular breakwater models of different dynamic properties have been developed and tested in regular wave environment in a wave flume. The performance efficiency of the breakwater is determined by the wave transmission and energy dissipation characteristics. For comparison purposes, a control test model with similar dimensions is also tested in the similar test conditions. The proposed model with sand ballast at the bottom has been proven to have a higher wave attenuation capability than the other test models and the performance efficiency is comparable to that of the rigid box-type floating breakwater in some cases.

TI  - A review on mercury biogeochemistry in mangrove sediments: Hotspots of methylmercury production?
AB  - Wetlands are highly productive and biologically diverse environments that provide numerous ecosystem services, but can also be sources of methylmercury (MeHg) production and export. Mangrove wetlands contribute up to 15% of the coastal sediment carbon storage and ~10% of the particulate terrestrial carbon exported to the ocean. Thus, mercury (Hg) methylation in mangrove sediments and subsequent MeHg output to adjacent waters could have a great impact on global Hg cycling. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the literature on worldwide Hg concentrations in mangrove ecosystems, and the results reveal that a large range of total Hg (THg) and MeHg concentrations is detected in mangrove systems. Then, we discuss the potential roles of organic matter (OM) in controlling the Hg biogeochemistry in mangrove sediments. The intense OM decomposition by anoxic reduction (e.g., sulfate reduction) drastically affects sediment chemistries, such as redox potential, pH, and sulfur speciation, all of which may have a great impact on MeHg production. While the outwelling of carbon from mangroves has been extensively examined, little is known about their roles in exporting MeHg to adjacent waters. Our understanding of Hg biogeochemical processes in mangrove systems is constrained by the limited MeHg data and a lack of in-depth studies on the Hg methylation potential in this ecologically important environment. More efforts are needed to gain better insights into the contributions mangrove wetlands to the global Hg cycle. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimating Change in Sedimentary Organic Carbon Content During Mangrove Restoration in Southern China Using Carbon Isotopic Measurements
AB  - Based on total carbon (C) and C isotopes in sediment cores, sedimentary organic carbon (SOC) was quantified in three types of mangrove sites (barren flat sites without mangroves, mangrove plantations, and natural mangrove forests), which were considered to represent a continuum from least restored to most restored sites in southern China. SOC densities in the barren sites, plantations, and natural forests were 90, 170 and 288 Mg ha(-1), respectively. We inferred that mangrove restoration increased SOC accumulation in coastal areas. At 0-70 cm depth, SOC delta C-13 values in both mangrove sites ranged from -27.37 parts per thousand to -23.07 parts per thousand and exhibited gradual enrichment with depth. In contrast, the values in the barren flat sites remained around -22.19 parts per thousand and fluctuated slightly with depth. At 0-60 cm, the C-14 ages of the SOC in the barren flat site, the natural mangrove site, and the artificial mangrove site ranged from 1 397 to 2608, 255 to 2453, and 391 to 2 512 years BP, respectively. In both types of mangrove sites but not in the barren flat sites, the enrichment of delta C-13 with depth was related to increases in SOC decay and SOC age with depth. According to analysis of C-14 age, much of the mangrove-derived C was transported and stored at 0-60 cm depth under anaerobic conditions in both mangrove sites. The sediments of mangrove forests in southern China sequester large quantities of SOC during mangrove restoration.

TI  - Reusable biopolymer based heavy metal filter as plant protection for phytoremediation
AB  - Bioremediation via floating treatment wetlands/islands (FTW/I) is a sustainable, upcoming strategy to clean over-fertilized waters. Heavy metal pollution could be addressed in the same system. For implementing this feature, heavy-metal-adsorbing filter papers were prepared in a scalable procedure. Polyamine-functionalized papers based on the grafting of polyethyleneimine (PEI) and chitosan were prepared in aqueous immersion baths and tested for their heavy metal adsorption capability. Compared to untreated cellulose, the prepared filter papers exhibited great heavy metal reduction in a filtration setup. Compellingly, the natural biopolymer functionalization with chitosan adsorbed similar or even higher amounts (80\% Ni, 65\% Co, 100\% Cu, 85\% Fe, 40\% Cr, 90\% Cd, and 66\% Zn of the 5 ppm heavy metal sulfate solutions) compared to the PEI filters (48\% Ni, 36\% Co, 89\% Cu, 96\% Fe, 45\% Cr, 84\% Cd, and 62\% Zn) at pH 6.5. Moreover, the filters can be re-used simply by acidic washing to desorb the heavy metals, which was demonstrated in five repeating cycles. The presented chitosan-cellulose papers were prepared from renewable resources in a 3-step production lane and are a sustainable choice for various heavy-metal-removing applications. The papers can be implemented into floating treatment wetland systems to protect plants and microorganisms during phytoremediation processes and to add the additional feature of heavy metal removal for FTWs.

TI  - Albacora Leste Field development: Reservoir aspects and development strategy
AB  - Albacora Leste is one of the largest Campos Basin deep-water oilfields. The main reservoirs are Miocene sandstones with high porosity and permeability. Intensive application of the following technologies was important to make field development technically and economically successful: high quality three-dimensional seismic; image logs and logging while drilling; long gravel-packed horizontal wells; thermally insulated flowlines, allowing flow assurance for distant satellite wells; and massive sea water injection for sweep, and reservoir pressure maintenance. In order to avoid scale deposition as a result of sea water injection, a Sulphate Removal Unit was installed in the P-50 FPSO. A discussion covers the key aspects of the reservoirs; the drainage modeling and design, as well as the strategy adopted during project implementation, to overcome main reservoir uncertainties, such as fluid type, connectivity, and net pay, accomplishing at the end of successful project execution.

TI  - Toward Carbon-Neutral Electric Power Systems in the New York State: A Novel Multi-Scale Bottom-Up Optimization Framework Coupled with Machine Learning for Capacity Planning at Hourly Resolution
AB  - In this work, we propose a novel multi-scale bottom-up optimization framework for the carbon-neutral transition planning of the electric power sector, which incorporates hourly time scale and electricity storage to address the reliability and energy balance issues of the future deep-decarbonized power systems. In addition to the technology and capacity information for each facility, the proposed framework also accounts for facility ages, which are usually omitted in the literature, without significantly increasing the computational demand. To reduce the computational requirement of simultaneously optimizing capacity planning and hourly systems operations over the next few decades, a reduced model is developed based on representative days, using a novel approach that integrates multiple machine learning techniques. Based on the optimal transition pathways, hourly operational simulations are conducted for every year within the planning horizon to obtain detailed optimization results. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework, a case study for the New York State is presented through two cases, with and without electricity storage capacity expansion. The proposed approach using principal component analysis coupled with K-means outcompetes multiple conventional approaches of using clustering techniques directly. The transition planning results show that the total generation capacity for the case with electricity capacity expansion is 39% higher than the other case, while the latter case has 200% more generation capacity from non-intermittent sources. Detailed hourly operational simulation results indicate that offshore wind, hydro, and utility solar are the primary power sources by 2040 for the case with electricity storage capacity expansion, while hydro, offshore wind, and nuclear are the main electricity sources for the other case.

TI  - Hydrate formation tendency of lower tertiary fluid (LTF) production
AB  - The Lower Tertiary has been one of the most significant discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) oil and gas plays. On February 25th 2012 Petrobras successfully began production of the Cascade and Chinook lower tertiary fields to the first Early Production System floating production, storage and offloading (EPS FPSO) in the GOM. The purpose of implementing an EPS was a stage wise process to understand and better approach expansion with uncertainty associated with the Ultra Deep Lower Tertiary play. Limited understanding of fluid properties during design led to the precautionary approach of managing flow assurance risks particularly associated with hydrate formation. Due to the under saturated nature of the lower tertiary oil there was much speculation that hydrates that form would self-disperse and not cause a plugging tendency. As a result of not being able to clearly understand risks early in design, mitigation measures applied were considered prudent. The purpose of the paper is to provide an interpretation of hydrate formation propensity associated with the lower tertiary fluids. Interpretation provided herein is based on recent fluid evaluations using state of the art laboratories and high pressure rheometery to understand impact on fluid behavior. The paper will discuss hydrate propensity and rheological effects of the LTF's using results obtained from experimental procedures where live oil LTF's were prepared at 40% water cut and tested in the presence of LDHI (Anti-Agglomerate) to evaluate their effectiveness in controlling hydrate formation. Findings from this work will be discussed in relation to operational mitigation measures of hydrates. The results presented will illustrate hydrate formation propensity, impacts on fluid rheology and how this information serves purpose in determining the potential risks of hydrates when water cut becomes prominent during production. Additionally, useful insight into production system design and production operating strategies preventing hydrate blockages shall be outlined. The paper attempts to help the reader realize hydrates associated with the Lower Tertiary Production, which is considered a major source of future production in the GOM.

TI  - Carbon sequestration capacity of shifting sand dune after establishing new vegetation in the Tengger Desert, northern China
AB  - Reconstructing vegetation in arid and semiarid areas has become an increasingly important management strategy to realize habitat recovery, mitigate desertification and global climate change. To assess the carbon sequestration potential in areas where sand-binding vegetation has been established on shifting sand dunes by planting xeric shrubs located near the southeastern edge of the Tengger Desert in northern China, we conducted a field investigation of restored dune regions that were established at different times (20, 30, 47, and 55years ago) in the same area. We quantified the total organic carbon (TOC) in each ecosystem by summing the individual carbon contributions from the soil (soil organic carbon; SOC), shrubs, and grasses in each system. We found that the TOC, as well as the amount of organic carbon in the soil, shrubs, and grasses, significantly increased over time in the restored areas. The average annual rate of carbon sequestration was highest in the first 20years after restoration (3.26Ã—10-2kgÂ·m-2Â·year-1), and reached a stable rate (2.14Ã—10-2kgÂ·m-2Â·year-1) after 47years. Organic carbon storage in soil represented the largest carbon pool for both restored systems and a system containing native vegetation, accounting for 67.6%-85.0% of the TOC. Carbon in grass root biomass, aboveground grass biomass, litter, aboveground shrub biomass, and shrub root biomass account for 10.0%-21.0%, 0.2%-0.6%, 0.1%-0.2%, 1.7%-12.1% and 0.9%-6.2% of the TOC, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the 55-year-old restored system has the capacity to accumulate more TOC (1.02kgÂ·m-2 more) to reach the TOC level found in the natural vegetation system. These results suggest that restoring desert ecosystems may be a cost-effective and environmentally friendly way to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere and mitigate the effects of global climate change.

TI  - Regional scale impacts of distinct CO2 additions in the North Sea
AB  - A marine system model applied to the North West European shelf seas is used to Simulate the consequences of distinct CO2 additions such as those that could arise from a failure of geological sequestration schemes. The choice of leak scenario is guided by only a small number of available observations and requires several assumptions; hence the simulations reported on are engineered to be worse case scenarios. The simulations indicate that only the most extreme scenarios are capable of producing perturbations that are likely to have environmental consequences beyond the locality of a leak event. Tidally driven mixing rather than air-sea exchange is identified as the primary mechanism for dispersal of added CO2. We show that, given the available evidence, the environmental impact of a sequestration leak is likely to be insignificant when compared to the expected impact from continued non-mitigated atmospheric CO2 emissions and the subsequent acidification of the marine system. We also conclude that more research, including both leak simulations and assessment of ecological impacts is necessary to fully understand the impact of CO2 additions to the marine system.

TI  - A low-viscosity retarded acid system for stimulation of high-temperature deep wells
AB  - To enhance the efficiency of acid stimulation treatments in high-temperature carbonate reservoirs, the industry requires a superior retarded acid system that inherently displays high thermal stability, controlled reaction rate, and acceptable corrosion losses. One of the earliest means of acid retardation was through the addition of polymer gelling agents; however, these sytems commonly lead to formation damage. Alternatively, a commonly used approach to slow down the acid/rock reaction rate is through the use of acid- in-oil emulsions (i.e., emulsified acids). The viscous nature of these fluids, however, leads to unfavorably high friction pressures during the pumping process. Additionally, the thermal stability of emulsified acids is questionable at temperatures exceeding 300Â°F. Herein, we introduce a novel engineered acid system for stimulation of high-temperature carbonate reservoirs. The proposed technology reduces the free water in the system and consequently prevents full dissociation of the acid. Reducing the free water in the acid system was successfully achieved by engineering the acid formulation in the presence of another organic compound that is readily soluble in the acid. A series of benchtop carbonate dissolution experiments were performed under static conditions at room temperature to identify the optimal engineered formulation needed to achieve the desired retardation effect. The retardation behavior of this system was further supported by reaction rate studies, coreflood measurements and corrosion loss data. The proposed acid system was evaluated at temperatures and pore pressures up to 350Â°F and 3000 psi, respectively. Experimental results confirmed that the engineered acid system requires only 0.28 PV to achieve a breakthrough (12 inch core), which represents a significant reduction as compared to some reported emulsified acid systems. Importantly, the fluid formulation was systematically fine-tuned in order to impart the desired fluid-property characteristics: low-viscosity (est. 4 cp), high dissolving power (4.16 lb acid/ gal), fast wormhole propagation rate, low corrosion loss (<0.05 lb/ft2, 275Â°F) and high thermal stability (>300Â°F). The acid system can be readily mixed on-the-fly with existing equipment. This is a desirable feature particularly when it comes to offshore operations as no special preparation methods are required. It is the opinion of the authors that this novel acid system provides the industry with a suitable fluid alternative that may offer the potential to enhance oil and gas production in carbonate reservoirs. The fluid is stable at high temperatures and may have the potential to be used in a broad range of stimulation applications. Importantly, this low-viscosity retarded acid system presents the industry with a novel acid alternative where acid retardation by polymer addition or emulsification in diesel is no longer required.

TI  - Warming and CO2 enhance arctic heterotrophic microbial activity
AB  - Ocean acidification and warming are two main consequences of climate change that can directly affect biological and ecosystem processes in marine habitats. The Arctic Ocean is the region of the world experiencing climate change at the steepest rate compared with other latitudes. Since marine planktonic microorganisms play a key role in the biogeochemical cycles in the ocean it is crucial to simultaneously evaluate the effect of warming and increasing CO2 on marine microbial communities. In 20 L experimental microcosms filled with water from a high-Arctic fjord (Svalbard), we examined changes in phototrophic and heterotrophic microbial abundances and processes [bacterial production (BP) and mortality], and viral activity (lytic and lysogenic) in relation to warming and elevated CO2. The summer microbial plankton community living at 1.4Â°C in situ temperature, was exposed to increased CO2 concentrations (135-2,318 Î¼atm) in three controlled temperature treatments (1, 6, and 10Â°C) at the UNIS installations in Longyearbyen (Svalbard), in summer 2010. Results showed that chlorophyll a concentration decreased at increasing temperatures, while BP significantly increased with pCO2 at 6 and 10Â°C. Lytic viral production was not affected by changes in pCO2 and temperature, while lysogeny increased significantly at increasing levels of pCO2, especially at 10Â°C (R2 = 0.858, p = 0.02). Moreover, protistan grazing rates showed a positive interaction between pCO2 and temperature. The averaged percentage of bacteria grazed per day was higher (19.56 Â± 2.77% d-1) than the averaged percentage of lysed bacteria by virus (7.18 Â± 1.50% d-1) for all treatments. Furthermore, the relationship among microbial abundances and processes showed that BP was significantly related to phototrophic pico/nanoflagellate abundance in the 1Â°C and the 6Â°C treatments, and BP triggered viral activity, mainly lysogeny at 6 and 10Â°C, while bacterial mortality rates was significantly related to bacterial abundances at 6Â°C. Consequently, our experimental results suggested that future increases in water temperature and pCO2 in Arctic waters will produce a decrease of phytoplankton biomass, enhancement of BP and changes in the carbon fluxes within the microbial food web. All these heterotrophic processes will contribute to weakening the CO2 sink capacity of the Arctic plankton community.

TI  - A 4000-Meter-Rated Deepwater Cabled Ocean Observing System: Lessons Learned from Two Years of Operation
AB  - In recent years, there have been several major initiatives to install fiber-optic cabled ocean observatories in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Europe. Lighthouse has operated a fiber-optic cabled ocean observing system off the northern coast of the Sultanate of Oman for seven years: the Lighthouse Ocean Research Initiative (LORI) I. In early 2010, a second cabled system was installed farther to the south, LORI II. LORI II is comprised of three, 2500-m-long moored arrays each equipped with eight Doppler current profilers and additional environmental sensors. The moorings sit along the 3000 m bathymetric line, so the uppermost current Doppler profiler uses a low frequency (75 kHz) to capture velocities and acoustic backscatter for the uppermost 500 m of the water column. Lighthouse had significant experience operating a cabled array in shallower water (<1350 m) and had deployed and recovered autonomous arrays from the same locations as the cabled LORI II instruments several times in the past and thus confidence was high the system would operate as installed. After deployment, the quality of the raw data was very good with nearly all of the installed sensors reporting; but by year two, communication with two of the moorings had been lost. The cause of the problem has been tentatively identified. Herein, we discuss the research, development, installation, and operation of LORI II over the past two and a half years, scientific results from LORI II data, and the lessons learned from seven years of successful operation of the LORI I cabled system, all of which will be incorporated in a new- and-improved, science-driven, cabled LORI II design.

TI  - Obstacles to the underground
AB  - The article discusses barriers to the advancement of the underground industry in North America. Moving major portions of transportation infrastructure underground can preserve the urban historical heritage and restore public space for better use, including parks and recreation. Higher and better uses of scarce real estate can translate to increased tax revenue. Reliable communication facilities can be constructed without unattractive aboveground equipment. Alternative technologies are also emerging in the field of power generation. Some of these technologies can threaten the development of major hydropower developments, many of which rely on penstock and tailrace tunnels and in some cases underground powerhouses. However, other technologies, such as offshore wind and geothermal, actually present opportunities for underground construction. Another obstacle to our industry is the fact that most underground projects take a long time to develop.

TI  - Greenhouse gas flux with reflooding of a drained salt marsh soil
AB  - Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and bury more C per square meter annually than any other ecosystem. Reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Carbon credits can be generated and sold by restoring marshes, but only if C sequestration and net reductions in greenhouse gases (GHG) are reliably quantified. Restored marshes, however, may exhibit different patterns of GHG emissions than natural marshes and it is possible that they could temporarily become sources of N2O even in the usually N-limited estuarine environment. Research on short-term GHG flux following salt marsh restoration is limited to studies of two restored marshes which examined GHG flux more than six months after the return of tidal flooding. Here we report on a laboratory experiment in which soil cores collected from a drained agricultural marsh on the St. Lawrence Estuary were flooded with estuary water. Gas flux measurements immediately after flooding revealed small increases in N2O and CH4, but a large decline in CO2 yielding, from a climatic perspective, a net cooling effect over the observation period. In addition to restoring the land's capacity to sequester C once a marsh develops, returning tidal flooding thus appears to have the added benefit of stemming large ongoing C losses. With more than 400 km2 of undeveloped dykeland, Eastern Canada is well positioned to restore large sections of marsh and contribute to reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

TI  - Progress and prospect of CNOOC's oil and gas well drilling and completion technologies [ä¸­å›½æµ·æ´‹æ²¹æ°”é’»å®Œäº•æŠ€æœ¯çš„è¿›å±•ä¸Žå±•æœ›]
AB  - Offshore oil and gas production has become an important growth pole to ensure national energy security. However, China's offshore oil and gas production is lack of key core technologies and weak in tool and equipment foundation and can hardly support the optimized fast development of important fields. To solve these technological difficulties, China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) insisted on independent technological innovation and overcame a series of key core technologies through theoretical research and key technology research and test during the 13th Five-Year Plan. And the following research results are obtained. First, several key technologies are broken through, including efficient drilling and completion in the middle and deep layers of the Bohai Sea, offshore large-scale heavy oil thermal recovery, deep-water oil and gas field development, and high temperature and high pressure well drilling and completion in the South China Sea, unconventional oil and gas stimulation, and offshore emergency rescue. Domestic first independently operated ultra deep water giant gas field, namely "Deepsea 1" is successfully put into production, so that the leap from 300 m to 1 500 m of water depth and from exploration to development is realized. Second, key tools and equipment are developed, such as logging while drilling and rotary steering drilling system, deep-water drilling surface conductor, underwater emergency killing device, and underwater wellhead Christmas tree, which promote the high-quality development of China's offshore oil industry. Finally, some suggestions are proposed as follows. In the future, CNOOC shall strengthen independent technological innovation, quicken the pace to deepsea oil and gas, and continue to research key core technologies for oil and gas reserves and production increase (e.g. continuous localization of drilling and completion technologies, equipment and materials in complex fields), commingled gas production and test and green energy transformation (e.g. geothermal energy), so as to make greater contributions to ensure national energy security and build a maritime power.

TI  - Introduction to Renewable Energy Powered Desalination
AB  - Life on earth depends on water, which is an essential element for life. Three-fourths of the planet's surface is covered with water but 97% of this huge quantity is contained in the oceans and is salty water and only a tiny 3% is freshwater. This small percentage of the earth's water, however, supplies most of the needs of humanity and exists in lakes, rivers, and ground water. As can be understood, the only practically inexhaustible sources of water are the oceans, which, however, are of very high salinity, much above the safe consumption limit. It would be therefore possible to address the water shortage problem faced by many countries and many millions of people with seawater desalination. The separation of salts from seawater, however, requires large amounts of energy which, when produced from fossil fuels, can increase the environmental pollution and thus the climate problems of the earth. There is therefore a need to employ environmental-friendly energy sources, such as renewables, in order to desalinate seawater. A large variety of systems used to convert seawater into freshwater suitable for human use are presented in this chapter together with a variety of systems which can be used to convert effectively renewable energy sources into useful forms of energy. These can be used to power desalination systems and include solar collectors, photovoltaics, solar ponds, and geothermal energy. Both direct and indirect collection systems are presented. Direct collection systems use one piece of equipment both to collect solar radiation and use the energy collected to desalinate seawater. The representative example of these types of systems is the solar still. In contrast, indirect collection systems employ two different subsystems: one for collecting renewable energy and a different one for desalination. These comprise two broad categories: the phase change processes, which include the multistage flash, multiple effect distillation, vapor compression, and membrane distillation; and the membrane processes, which include reverse osmosis and electrodialysis. The chapter concludes with some general guidelines which can be used for the selection of desalination and renewable energy systems, their combination to produce freshwater in an environmental-friendly way, and the parameters that need to be considered.

TI  - Towards a Zero Energy Island
AB  - The aim of this study was to show the potential application of the available natural and alternative energy resources in Peng Chau Island, Hong Kong. The potential of different alternative energy resources was considered, such as solar, wind, tidal, wave, energy crops and MSW (municipal solid waste). The results show that some of the mentioned resources can be used very efficiently to supply the required electricity of the island whereas others are not very suitable. The analysis following a macroscopic approach is based on measured real data obtained by various government organizations. This study builds the basis of implementing renewable energy technologies on the island and gives hints to the reader that with a careful design, it is possible for the island to generate its required electrical energy on its own and almost without any CO2 emissions to the environment (except MSW, which is also discussed briefly). In the context of this study, the focus was on production of electrical energy only. Analog to the existing term ZEB (Zero Energy Building), a new term "Zero Energy Island" is introduced to name the same concept for islands. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Possible applications of communications satellites to offshore communications systems
AB  - Expanding offshore operations have generated an increased need for communications in both international and domestic areas. The capabilities of communications satellites are presented both as currently existing and as envisioned in the future. The possibilities of using these capabilities in offshore communications systems are discussed especially with regard to the potential of new services brought about by the latest generation of satellites currently under production. Two potentially new types of services are hypothesized. Lastly, progress on the development of a small earth station of low cost suitable for such services is reported. It is concluded that communications satellites hold potential both currently and in the future for various offshore operations.

TI  - Cementing excellence-in-execution: Contributes to well integrity on Myanmar's M9 block appraisal wells
AB  - In August 2014, PTTEP International started an appraisal drilling campaign in M9 block offshore Myanmar. The scope of work was 10 wells to be drilled using a moored semi-submersible rig. The purpose of these wells was to further firm-up the hydrocarbon potential of the field and also to find additional reserves within the Zawtika gas prospect to support field development plans which included platform installations in future project phases 1B & 1C. Therefore, ensuring integrity and proper well isolation for drilling, testing and well abandonment purposes was of critical importance. Maintaining operational integrity and surface efficiency is also highly required considering the challenging conditions typical of any remote location like Myanmar. Offshore project management in Myanmar is quite challenging. Many operators find that the far distances from out-of-country support facilities and load-out points to well locations make logistics a critical success factor with huge potential to affect cost and key performance indicators. In this project, the requirement from fast-drilling and high frequency of cement jobs it was important to eliminate any issues arising from design and preparation. One of main technical challenges was overcoming the risk of lost circulation. The top-hole operation required the dual 30 13-3/8 casing with both annuli being cemented in single operation and achieving cement returns to seabed. For operation integrity, a project support model has been set up to manage and achieve flawless service delivery starting with a comprehensive Project Readiness Assessment (PRA) tool enabling full analysis of all requirements: technical engineering, project logistics coordination necessary between bases in Thailand and Myanmar, detailed materials preparation & load-out procedure, equipment maintenance procedure, and communication protocol. During the project, deepwater operation integrity management tools were deployed to manage processes as per standard for every single cement job to satisfy design, execution and evaluation requirements. As a result, 10 out of 10 wells in M9A project have been delivered to expectation without any operational failure or cementing-related non-productive time. To maintain equivalent circulating density within limits imposed by formation properties, all primary casing cement slurries were pumped at densities below 15.0ppg, including gas-tight slurries where necessary. To mitigate the risks of loss circulation across the critical intermediate formations, a proprietary, new fiber-based LCM technology was introduced and deployed successfully, notably for the first time in Myanmar. The Appraisal campaign has been completed in May 2015 with all wells successfully drilled and abandonment barriers installed without any annulus communication incident, well barrier leak or regulatory-recordable HSE or well integrity issue. The project is a real example of team work between the operator and service company, application of fit-for-purpose solutions, and use of transformative quality management initiatives to achieve successful delivery of an oilfield project.

TI  - Effects of desiccation and rehydration on carbon fixation and DOC release in Sargassum thunbergii
AB  - Although macroalgae is regarded as the emerging fourth category of ``blue carbon ``, few studies are available on its carbon sequestration and DOC (dissolved organic carbon) release mechanism at present. In addition, tidal action is an important environmental factor in the intertidal zone, which affects the carbon sequestration and DOC release of macroalgae. Therefore, we set 4-h desiccation and 1-h rehydration to examine the effects of drying-rewetting on the photosynthetic carbon fixation capacity and DOC release mechanism of Sargassum thunbergii. The flowing seawater can provide the nutrients for the growth of marine plants, which plays a vital role in the growth and reproduction of marine plants, so a measurement system that can adjust the flow speed was designed to study the effects of 1 h-rehydration on S. thunbergii. The results showed the desiccation decreased carbon fixation capacity, but increased the protection of PSII by down-regulating F-v/F-m and Phi(PSII) and up regulating NPQ, thereby promoting the recovery of carbon fixation capacity during 1-h rehydration period. It was found that the DOC release rate of S. thunbergii decreased with the carbon fixation rate increase and it was much greater than the carbon fixation rate in the 1-h rehydration period. The DOC release after rehydration was somehow a passive release, which was related to the increase of osmotic pressure, cell membrane damage, and carbon accumulation caused by desiccation. This measurement system can provide a practical reference for the study of carbon sink of macroalgae.

TI  - Safety and Reliability Analysis of an Ammonia-Powered Fuel-Cell System
AB  - Recently, the shipping industry has been under increasing pressure to improve its environmental impact with a target of a 50\% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, compared to the 2008 levels. For this reason, great attention has been placed on alternative zero-carbon fuels, specifically ammonia, which is considered a promising solution for shipping decarbonisation. In this respect, a novel ammonia-powered fuel-cell configuration is proposed as an energy-efficient power generation configuration with excellent environmental performance. However, there are safety and reliability concerns of the proposed ammonia-powered system that need to be addressed prior to its wider acceptance by the maritime community. Therefore, this is the first attempt to holistically examine the safety, operability, and reliability of an ammonia fuel-cell-powered ship, while considering the bunkering and fuel specifications. The proposed methodology includes the novel combination of a systematic preliminary hazard identification process with a functional and model-based approach for simulating the impact of various hazards. Furthermore, the critical faults and functional failures of the proposed system are identified and ranked according to their importance. This work can be beneficial for both shipowners and policymakers by introducing technical innovation and for supporting the future regulatory framework.

TI  - Design and selection of turbo-machinery for solar and geothermal power plants
AB  - Several important sources of renewable energy, such as biomass, concentrated solar panels, waste heat, geothermal, or tidal, use different types of turbo-machinery for conversion to electrical power. The diverse nature of the heat sources and their cyclic behavior make the design of the turbo-machinery power generation equipment quite different than that of the steam turbines used in conventional power plants. The high capital cost of these renewable facilities and the limited hours of operation are powerful drivers to increase the turbomachinery efficiency. The paper reviews the state-of-the-art hardware designs for each application from an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) Contractor's perspective. Specifically for geothermal power, the discussion covers the application of working fluids other than steam, organic fluid, various mixtures of fluids etc. The benefits and limitations of each method are addressed, along with the impact of geothermal source flow and temperature on the cycle efficiency. The paper also covers the special requirements for single- and multiplestage arrangements for geothermal applications. For concentrated thermal solar either in high-temperature applications, such as the power tower, or in mediumtemperature applications, such as the solar troughs collector field, the paper addresses the unique requirements for performance, integration, and fast startup of the turbines, including the impact of various thermal storage options. Since most of the concentrated thermal solar applications are in arid regions, the paper discusses the heat sink selection (air-cooled condenser [ACC], hybrid, Heller tower, etc.) and how it impacts the plant design and performance. In conclusion, the paper deals with practical issues of achieving a balance between the economics of generation and cost of equipment and reliability for renewable power plants.

TI  - Improving petroleum system identification in offshore salt environments: Gulf of Mexico and Red Sea case studies
AB  - Offshore exploration is a costly endeavor that entails multi-million dollar expenditures to acquire synthetic aperture radar data, electromagnetic data, 2-D seismic data, as well as 3-D seismic data to evaluate subsurface structures and systems. However, while these technologies lend an understanding to the geologic structure of subsea systems, these do not address the critical question of the presence of a petroleum system (i.e. charge). This case study was conducted by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation in their Marco Polo field in the Gulf of Mexico. The project focused on improving the mapping of hydrocarbons from petroleum systems by augmenting seismic with additional technologies such as detailed multibeam bathymetry, side scan sonar, and acoustic backscatter to acquire high-resolution sea floor characterization and ultra-sensitive hydrocarbon detection to provide hydrocarbon detection with a thousand times greater sensitivity than traditional methods. The high resolution geophysical data significantly improved the ability to locate macroseep sites. Additionally, the ultra-sensitive hydrocarbon system was able to identify hydrocarbons from both macroseepage and microseepage. Thus, hydrocarbons were detected in one hundred percent of the core samples, instead of 10% as found with traditional methods. While the Marco Polo site focused on macroseepage acquisition the Red Sea case study focused on microseepage acquisition. The Red Sea area that was overlain by 8,000 ft of evaporitic salt and anhydrite sequences that also contained inter-bedded shale sequences. The field was a fractured sub-salt rift basin producing from the Miocene Kareem and Rudeis formations. The client had drilled two producing wells, but had also drilled three dry wells. The thick salt sequence made seismic data difficult to interpret and the extensive faulting added additional risk to the exploration efforts. Given the complex geologic system and the difficulties associated with the seismic imaging, ultra-sensitive hydrocarbon mapping was employed to add understanding to the geologic structure and add clarity to the boundaries of the hydrocarbon accumulations. Liquid hydrocarbons were detected through the 8,000 ft salt sequence and then mapped across the field indicating areas of high probability of oil locations and areas of low probability. The probability map correctly predicted the previously drilled producing and dry wells. The hydrocarbon survey results also identified two three-way closures in the field as well as a potential fault not identified by seismic data. Subsequent to the study a well was drilled based on the survey results and produced 800 bopd, lending credence to the hydrocarbon probability maps generated by the survey. The result was the use of new technologies to derisk offshore exploration efforts by more effectively determining the presence of an offshore petroleum system through salt sequences. Additionally, it mapped reservoir boundaries and defined reservoir sweet spots with better pressure and porosity thus enhancing improved production. Â© 2016, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Bioremediation and other potential applications of coccolithophorid algae: A review
AB  - Coccolithophorid algae (Haptophycea) are mainly marine unicellular phytoplankton. The coccolithophorids are of global interest as they can fix carbon by photosynthesis as well as in calcium carbonate (coccoliths). They are the largest carbon sinks and one of the largest primary producers on the planet. They can also produce high amounts of lipids which have a high potential application as a renewable fuel and alternative food source. This paper reviews current knowledge on coccolithophorid algae photosynthesis and calcification and their potential industrial applications. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Seaweed farms provide refugia from ocean acidification
AB  - Seaweed farming has been proposed as a strategy for adaptation to ocean acidification, but evidence is largely lacking. Changes of pH and carbon system parameters in surface waters of three seaweed farms along a latitudinal range in China were compared, on the weeks preceding harvesting, with those of the surrounding seawaters. Results confirmed that seaweed farming is efficient in buffering acidification, with Saccharina japonica showing the highest capacity of 0.10 pH increase within the aquaculture area, followed by Gracilariopsis lemaneiformis (Delta pH = 0.04) and Porphyra haitanensis (Delta pH = 0.03). The ranges of pH variability within seaweed farms spanned 0.14-0.30 unit during the monitoring, showing intense fluctuations which may also help marine organisms adapt to enhanced pH temporal variations in the future ocean. Deficit in pCO(2) in waters in seaweed farms relative to control waters averaged 58.7 +/- 15.9 mu atm, ranging from 27.3 to 113.9 mu atm across farms. However, Delta pH did not significantly differ between day and night. Dissolved oxygen and Omega(arag) were also elevated in surface waters at all seaweed farms, which are benefit for the survival of calcifying organisms. Seaweed farming, which unlike natural seaweed forests, is scalable and is not dependent on suitable substrate or light availability, could serve as a low-cost adaptation strategy to ocean acidification and deoxygenation and provide important refugia from ocean acidification.

TI  - Photosynthetic adaptation strategy of Ulva prolifera floating on the sea surface to environmental changes
AB  - For 8 consecutive years, a green tide has originated in the southern Yellow Sea and spread to the Qingdao offshore area. The causative species, Ulva prolifera, always forms a very thick thallus mat that is capable of drifting long distances over long periods. During this process, although the thalli face disturbance by complex environmental factors, they maintain high biomass and proliferation. We hypothesized that some form of photosynthetic adaptation strategy must exist to protect the thalli. Therefore, we studied the different photosynthetic response characteristics of the surface and lower layers of the floating thallus mats, and investigated the physiological and molecular-level adaptation mechanisms. The results showed that: (1) U.Â prolifera has strong photosynthetic capability that ensures it can gain sufficient energy to increase its biomass and adapt to long-distance migration. (2) Surface layer thalli adapt to the complex environment by dissipating excess energy via photosynthetic quantum control (energy quenching and energy redistribution between PSII/PSI) to avoid irreversible damage to the photosynthetic system. (3) Lower layer thalli increase their contents of Chlorophyll a (Chl a) and Chlorophyll b (Chl b) and decrease their Chl a/Chl b ratio to improve their ability to use light energy. (4) U.Â prolifera has strong photosynthetic plasticity and can adapt to frequent exchange between the surface and lower layer environments because of wave disturbance. Pigment component changes, energy quenching, and energy redistribution between PSII/PSI contribute to this photosynthetic plasticity. Â© 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS

TI  - Large scale tertiary CO2 EOR in mature water flooded Norwegian oil fields
AB  - A technical-economical model for a large-scale infrastructure combining CO2 EOR and aquifer storage has been used to construct a scenario including 23 Norwegian Continental Shelf oil fields that have been identified as potential candidates for CO2 flooding. In the injection scenario, 70 million tonnes of CO2 is injected annually over 40 years. A limited sensitivity analysis has been performed. The EOR potential for continuous CO2 injection is estimated to be between 276 and 351 million Sm3. This corresponds to 5.9 and 7.6 \% of the oil originally in place depending on the oil price (low/high: 40/120 USD/bbl), the cost of CO2 that the oil producers must pay for all stored CO2 (low/high: 0/50 USD/tonne) and well costs (low/high 25/42 million USD/well). In addition to transportation costs through the main pipeline (8 USD/tonne) specific costs for aquifer deposition also applies (8 USD/tonne). CO2 mass balance calculations show that more CO2 is stored in the oil reservoirs during tertiary flooding compared to the CO2 formed by combustion of the produced oil. The CO2 footprint becomes even more negative when the CO2 stored in aquifers is included in the calculations. (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The use of hydraulic cushioning in the docking of super tankers
AB  - The docking of super tankers at unprotected offshore loading facilities can present major problems of energy dissipation during impact. Hydraulic fender units offer several distinct advantages over conventional resilient fender units, namely: nearly complete dissipation of energy as opposed to energy storage, more efficient dissipation of this energy resulting in less fender travel or lower force levels, velocity sensitive force control, and more positive control by tugboats because of the lack of rebound. Actual impact and computer studies have validated the advantages of hydraulic fendering. Â© 1972 Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Geochemical impact of oxygen on siliciclastic carbon storage reservoirs
AB  - In planning for large-scale CO2 capture procedures, there exists an economic incentive to leave minor gas components in the captured CO2 stream for geological storage, because doing so would reduce the cost of the capture process. However, co-injection of reactive impurities (such as O2, CO, H2, NOx, and SOx) may have detrimental effects on well injectivity, wellbore integrity, seal performance, and gas-brine-rock interactions. In this study we investigated, using a series of autoclave experiments, the potential impact of O2 as an impurity on geochemical reactions. Three sandstones were tested: Miocene sandstone (Texas offshore, USA), lower Tuscaloosa sandstone (Cranfield field, Mississippi, USA) and Cardium sandstone (Pembina field, Alberta, Canada). Samples were subjected to reaction with 1.88M NaCl solution and CO2, with and without the addition of a small volume of O2 in order to determine the geochemical effects of O2. A total of ten reaction experiments were conducted at 200bar and 70Â°C or 100Â°C. Overall, for rock samples lacking reducing minerals, co-injection of a small volume of O2 with supercritical CO2 showed only a limited geochemical impact compared to the reactions with pure CO2. The presence of O2 did not accelerate the dissolution of carbonate and feldspar minerals, nor did it alter the reaction pathways. However, the small amount of pyrite (â‰ˆ0.7%) contained in the Cardium sandstone had an important impact. As it was oxidized, the solution pH was further lowered because the Cardium sandstone contains little pH-buffering carbonate and feldspar minerals. Consequently, dissolution of carbonates and feldspars was enhanced by the more-acidic solution. Aqueous ferrous iron was largely converted to iron oxyhydroxides and precipitated on mineral surfaces. The minor cations that showed the largest increases in aqueous concentration (such as Mn, Sr, and Ba) were mostly mobilized from carbonates and were not significantly enhanced by O2 for the low-pyrite sandstones. Releases of trace metals, with the exception of Zn and Pb, were not enhanced by the presence of O2. In fact, concentrations of As, V, Mo, and other oxyanions were lower in the reactions involving O2 than in the pure CO2 reactions, because these metals sorb on the newly precipitated iron oxyhydroxides.

TI  - Technological Approaches to Enhance Ecosystem Carbon Sink in China: Nature-based Solutions
AB  - â€œCarbon peak in 2030 and carbon neutralization in 2060â€ has been established as one of the important strategic goals of Chinaâ€™s economic and social development. During 2010â€“2020, the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems in China to sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) varied from 1.0 to 1.3 Gt/a, with high uncertainty. To enhance the carbon sink capacity of Chinese terrestrial ecosystems, the combination with land space planning and ecological protection is essential. It is necessary to first stabilize the existing carbon storage in these ecosystems, such as forest, grassland, wetland, coast, and others, and then implement some important ecological protection and ecological restoration projects at large scale. In addition, new technologies of carbon capture, utilization, and storage based on biological CO2 fixation principles (Bio-CCUS) or ecological CO2 fixation principles (Eco-CCUS) should be developed and applied. Through integrated regional ecosystem management and spatial planning, as well as multiple technologies to enhance carbon sink, it is possible to double the carbon sink capacity, both natural and human-made, arriving at 2.0â€“2.5 Gt/a during 2050-2060. In practice, we need to scientifically assess the key technologies of ecosystem carbon sink improvement in view of effectiveness, economic feasibility, and durability, and then comprehensively integrate these technologies into different regions for demonstrations at regional scale.

TI  - An optimized and intrinsically safe solution for LNG production and distribution in the Mediterranean area
AB  - The need to adopt strategies for the reduction of the environmental impact related to marine and road transport, as well as the reduction of the fuel running costs with phased replacement of fuel oil with LNG, makes the growth of a â€œsmall scale LNGâ€ approach crucial to support the evolution of the fuel market. Saipem recently developed an alternative LNG liquefaction technology designed to comply with the current LNG market scenario, and that is particularly suitable to small scale LNG solutions for bunkering and road fuelling. This proprietary liquefaction process technology has been implemented in a small scale pre-engineered liquefaction train, providing a compact arrangement with the opportunity to execute a modular installation of standardized equipment. This gas liquefaction process involves very low hydrocarbon and cryogenic liquid inventories, which makes it particularly suitable for onshore areas with reduced plot and severe permitting constraints. This also allows reducing indirect costs associated to process hazard mitigation. In addition, this technology is particularly versatile with respect to both the environment of application (onshore and offshore) and the gas composition to be liquefied. This ensures easy customization of the concept according to the project requirements. Â© 2019 Offshore Mediterranean Conference (OMC). All rights reserved.

TI  - Control of hybrid diesel/PV/battery/ultra-capacitor systems for future shipboard microgrids
AB  - In recent times, concerns over fossil fuel consumption and severe environmental pollution have grabbed attention in marine vessels. The fast development in solar technology and the significant reduction in cost over the past decade have allowed the integration of solar technology in marine vessels. However, the highly intermittent nature of photovoltaic (PV) modules might cause instability in shipboard microgrids. Moreover, the penetration is much more in the case of utilizing PV panels on ships due to the continuous movement. This paper, therefore, presents a frequency sharing approach to smooth the effect of the highly intermittent nature of PV panels integrated with the shipboard microgrids. A hybrid system based on an ultra-capacitor and a lithium-ion battery is developed such that high power and short term fluctuations are catered by an ultra-capacitor, whereas long duration and high energy density fluctuations are catered by the lithium-ion battery. Further, in order to cater for the fluctuations caused by weather or variation in sea states, a battery energy storage system (BESS) is utilized in parallel to the dc-link capacitor using a buck-boost converter. Hence, to verify the dynamic behavior of the proposed approach, the model is designed in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed model helps to smooth the fluctuations and to stabilize the DC bus voltage. Â© 2019 by the authors.

TI  - In-situ Observation of Bainite Transformation in CGHAZ of 420 MPa Grade Offshore Engineering Steel with Different Mo Contents
AB  - The 420 MPa grade offshore engineering steels with the different Mo contents were fabricated through Ca deoxidation. The effect of Mo content on the microstructure and the impact toughness of the coarse-grained heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) after the welding heat input of 100 kJ/cm were investigated by welding simulation and high-temperature laser scanning confocal microscopy (HTLSCM). As the Mo content is increased from 0.08 to 0.16 wt\%, the impact toughness at -40 degrees C is increased from 15 to 160 J, and the fracture is changed from cleavage to ductile and quasi-cleavage. Increasing Mo content leads to the increase in lath bainite (LB) and the decrease in granular bainite (GB) and acicular ferrite (AF) in CGHAZ. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) results show that the fraction of high angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) is increased from 45\% to 58\%, while the effective grain size (EGS) is decreased from 10.4 to 6.3 pm in the HAZ of the steels. The growth rates of bainite ferrite range from 39.7 and 134.5 mu m/s for Mo8 steel, and 51.2 to 165.6 mu m/s for Mo16 steel. In-situ observation shows that increasing Mo content decreases the austenite grain size from 114 to 100 mu m. As for Mo8 steel, AFs nucleate from the inclusions firstly. Then the different bainites nucleate, grow, stop growth and widen as they impinge the other bainites and grain boundaries. The secondary bainites finally nucleate from the prior bainite and AF As for Mo16 steel, the AF cannot nucleate, and the bainites have a similar nucleating and growth behavior as the Mo8 steel.

TI  - Long-term organic carbon sequestration in tidal marsh sediments is dominated by old-aged allochthonous inputs in a macrotidal estuary
AB  - Tidal marshes are vegetated coastal ecosystems that are often considered as hot-spots of atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Although large amounts of organic carbon (OC) are indeed being deposited on tidal marshes, there is no direct link between high OC deposition rates and high OC sequestration rates due to two main reasons. First, the deposited OC may become rapidly decomposed once it is buried and, second, a significant part of preserved OC may be allochthonous OC that has been sequestered elsewhere. In this study we aimed to identify the mechanisms controlling long-term OC sequestration in tidal marsh sediments along an estuarine salinity gradient (Scheldt estuary, Belgium and the Netherlands). Analyses of deposited sediments have shown that OC deposited during tidal inundations is up to millennia old. This allochthonous OC is the main component of OC that is effectively preserved in these sediments, as indicated by the low radiocarbon content of buried OC. Furthermore, OC fractionation showed that autochthonous OC is decomposed on a decadal timescale in saltmarsh sediments, while in freshwater marsh sediments locally produced biomass is more efficiently preserved after burial. Our results show that long-term OC sequestration is decoupled from local biomass production in the studied tidal marsh sediments. This implies that OC sequestration rates are greatly overestimated when they are calculated based on short-term OC deposition rates, which are controlled by labile autochthonous OC inputs. Moreover, as allochthonous OC is not sequestered in-situ, it does not contribute to active atmospheric CO2 sequestration in these ecosystems. A correct assessment of the contribution of allochthonous OC to the total sedimentary OC stock in tidal marsh sediments as well as a correct understanding of the long-term fate of locally produced OC are both necessary to avoid overestimations of the rate of in-situ atmospheric CO2 sequestration in tidal marsh sediments.

TI  - Blue economy of India and technology initiatives - I
AB  - Oceans covering 72% of the planet, commands the seventh position among the top ten economies. With the land based resources depleting fast, harvesting of the worldâ€™s ocean resources are in the uptrend. Increased and sustained utilization of the blue economic resources has the potential to shift the economy of the society from scarcity to abundance. India, with over 7600km long coastline and with an exclusive economic zone of 2.3 million km 2 and seeking extension for additional 560km have initiated policies to catalyse the growth of the Indian economy through blue economy. India spearheads the blue economic growth and security of all countries in the Indian Ocean region. The work done under this area is quite exhaustive and many developments are in the pipe line. The first part of the paper presented now discusses the living and non-living blue economic resources in India including the deep ocean minerals, hydrocarbons, renewable energy, desalination based on ocean thermal gradient and bio-prospecting; and the technology initiatives to harness the vast blue resources. It is proposed to bring additional areas on the same topic of Blue Economy during the next Oceans conference. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - The economic feasibility of Blue Carbon cooperation in the South China Sea region
AB  - Coastal Blue Carbon is the carbon stored in mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows. There is an urgent need to protect the coastal ecosystem by developing Blue Carbon economy. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility and mechanism of the Blue Carbon cooperation in the South China Sea Region (SCSR) from an economic angle. We utilize the paradigm of Cobb-Douglas production to stimulate Blue Carbon development and mathematically prove the feasibility of such a cooperation strategy. The Shapley value in game theory is further applied, which not only confirms the reality of this cooperation but also provides an allocation mechanism of the cooperation benefits. The results suggest that there exists a profitable opportunity for the Blue Carbon cooperation in the SCSR. Further discussion and suggestions are provided in promotion of research focus on the Blue Carbon cooperation. Â© 2019

TI  - Effective energy-saving device of Eco-Ship by using wave propulsion
AB  - In this work, an effective energy-saving device is proposed to extract wave energy and convert to useful propulsive thrust for a merchant ship travelling in waves. Eco-Ship was internationally introduced and aimed to reduce carbon dioxide emission generated from ships. The energy-saving device equipped underneath the front part of the ship model of general merchant ships that inspired by marine mammals is investigated in this work. An active control of pitch-oscillating bow fin with NACA0016 section is applied as an effective energy-saving device in this work. Free-running model test using a 1/50th scale model of a container ship was conducted for validating the effectiveness of this device. The ship speed, ship motion, angle of bow fin and power consuming are measured and recorded. There are two kinds of wavelength to ship length ratio of regular wave in the experiments with fixed propeller speed. Based on different heave motion, the different pitch angle of bow fin is controlled to obtain the extra energy from wave. The experimental results shows the feasibility of the energy-saving device when the phase lead of the bow fin pitch motion with respect to its heave motion set in a proper range between 60 degree to 200 degree. When the ratios of wavelength to ship length are 1.0 and 1.3, the maximum of power efficiency improving are around 6.5% and 18.9% respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed device is effective to enhance ship speed and save energy for achieving the goal of Eco-Ship. Â© 2016 IEEE.

TI  - IFLâ„¢ - A novel approach to the rehabilitation of sub-sea hydrocarbon pipelines using high performance solef pvdf flexible kevlar reinforced liners
AB  - PETRONAS Carigali (PCSB) is the owner and operator of an extensive network of sub-sea pipelines which are situated offshore from main land Malaysia, in the South China Seas. Many of these pipelines run from platform to platform and platform to onshore facilities over distances of between several hundred meters to several kilometers and in varying depths of water. Severe internal corrosion, due in large part to Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) has caused some of the pipelines to have a drastically reduced life span which has historically resulted in the replacement of pipelines becoming necessary within a time period as short as four years. Historically, there has not been a viable methodology that could be utilized to install such a corrosion barrier within a sub-sea pipeline, thus the project for the design and development of InField Linerâ„¢ (IFLâ„¢) system was instigated and within three years brought to a highly successful conclusion incorporating the full rehabilitation of an 8â€² pipeline carrying Crude media and which was due to been decommissioned within six months had the installation not gone ahead. This particular pipeline is now fully anticipated to provide a further 25 years of operational use to PCSB. Robert A. Walters, IFLâ„¢ Global Project Director and Chairman of Anticorrosion Protective Systems (APS), discusses the innovative InField Liner Technology, its offshore deployment within the PETRONAS pipeline network and the strategic plans for future global expansion.

TI  - Biofuels energy sources and future of biofuels energy in Turkey
AB  - Today, in Turkey, the most commonly used renewable resources are classical biomass energy and hydraulic energy. Although geothermal energy ranks third, its usage is limited. The usage of solar energy is at a symbolic level, that of wind energy is in its initial stages and the idea of tidal energy is out of concern. In spite of the important potential of modern biomass energy, agriculture of energy plants is not widely recognized, and the establishment of energy forests is realized in a limited fashion. This study is based on two essential considerations about biofuels: agricultural potential of Turkey for biofuels production and governmental policies about environmental friendly alternative fuels in Turkey. A policy to increase biodiesel production in Turkey by importing biofuels or shifting to oilseed- biomass production from another plant does not seem reliable or practical. As far as environmental pollution is concerned, the utilization of all fuels produces air pollutants, causing local, trans-boundary air pollution, and acid rain problems. Biofuel is a clean renewable fuel due to its properties, which is similar to diesel but generated from renewable resources such as vegetable oils, animal fats and energy crops. Although researchers developed the technology of biofuel some two to three decades ago, its use is not widespread, mainly due to the higher production cost involved. Due to the increasing concern on environmental protection, the number of research studies conducted on the usage of this fuel has increased especially in recent years. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Environmental impact of amines
AB  - The process of post combustion CO2-capture by chemical absorption relies on large scale use of chemicals, typically amines in aqueous solution. In such operations, emissions of amines may occur through the cleaned exhaust gas, as degraded solvent and as accidental spills. It is thus important that the chemicals used have low or no environmental effects. To check this, standard ecotoxicity and biodegradability tests for a marine environment were performed on more than 40 amines, including both solvents already in use for CO2-removal and new promising chemicals. The results form a database for environmental risk assessment of common absorption solvents and will be used to correlate chemical structure of the solvents to degradation and toxicity data for use in solvent screening. Some of the solvents used for carbon capture, have been shown to have low biodegradability. The tertiary amines which have been tested do not degrade easily, while the amino acids tested both have low toxicity and degrade easily. The fate estimation model EPI Suiteâ„¢[US EPA, Washington DC, USA] has also been used to estimate the biodegradation and toxicity of the chemicals. It was compared to the experimental results to investigate if this tool could be used for future solvent screening. For the biodegradability the predictions showed agreement with 48% of the tested compounds, while for ecotoxicity the predictions showed agreement with 66%. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper discusses the need, methods and challenges for maintenance optimization to improve the reliability, availability, and profitability of wind power plants being a major source of renewable energy today and in future ``smart grids{''}. The present maintenance of wind power plants is extensive and costly, especially at offshore sites. The paper discusses approaches to maintenance strategy optimization aiming at reaching cost-efficient maintenance and thus enhanced profitability of wind power plants. It presents results from practical case studies utilising the method of Reliability-Centred Asset Maintenance and highlights the factors that impact the benefit of the maintenance strategies. The results show that new solutions for condition monitoring of the drive train and blades in wind turbines can be cost-efficient with respect to the reliability and availability of wind turbines today.

TI  - Mineralisation of Weathered Crude Oil by a Hydrocarbonoclastic Consortia in Marine Mesocosms
AB  - Marine waters are most vulnerable to crude oil pollution due to increased sea-based oil-related activities. Successful remediation of such polluted environments is normally carried out in a laboratory with suitable physical and environmental alterations. However, it is challenging to alter the physical and environmental conditions in crude oil-contaminated natural environments. In a previous study, six hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria were isolated from an oil-contaminated site. Here we report on their ability to mineralise weathered crude oil as a carbon source in seawater mesocosms, in order to construct a hydrocarbonoclastic consortia for the effective mineralisation of hydrocarbons present in the weathered crude oil at seawater-based environment. This was completed without altering the physical and environmental parameters (salinity, pH and temperature) and followed by the detection of microbial community changes. The total amount of oil mineralised by these six isolates individually over 28-day incubation ranged from 4.7 to 10 \%. The bacterial consortia composed of these six strains showed a greater mineralisation rate (18.5 \%). Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis revealed that the functionally dominant species were present after the first week (week 2 to week 4) following the addition of the consortia, which were represented in dendrogram by cluster 2 and also these weeks representing a distinct point on the Pareto-Lorenz curve; no community could be identified in controls in which no consortia were added. This shows that the addition of consortia potentially dealt with changing environmental conditions and preserved its functionality followed by effective mineralisation of weathered crude oil.

TI  - Renewable energy sources in Cuba: Current situation and development prospects
AB  - Cuba, a small country in the Caribbean Sea with a total land area of 109,886 km2 and a population of around 11.2 million, has no significant proved oil, gas and coal reserves and use, in a very limited manner, some of the four main renewable energy sources available in the country, generating just 50.1 GW/h or 4.04% of the total electricity consumed in 2015 (20,288 GW/h). In 2016, electricity consumption fell to 15,182 GW/h; this means a reduction of 25% in comparison to 2015. The renewable energy sources available in the country are: Hydropower, wind power, solar photovoltaic and bioenergy. In 2015, out of Cuba's total 566 MW of renewable energy capacity installed, 83% of the total was in the bioenergy sector. In 2016, the participation of renewable energy sources in the energy mix of the country reached 4.65%. The participation of renewable energy sources in the energy mix in Cuba should reach 24% in 2030. Â© 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - CARBON STORAGE POTENTIAL OF NATURAL AND PLANTED MANGALS IN TRANG, THAILAND
AB  - This study aims to investigate the carbon storage potential for 25 year-old (planted ) and 50 year-old (natural) mangrove stands and mangrove sediment, in three districts of Trang province, Thailand. The results show a lower carbon content in the aboveground biomass of 10-25-year-old (planted) stands than in the >50-year old (natural) stands. However, we found more organic carbon in sediments in planted sites than in natural sites, which could be partly due to the higher tree densities in the former. The derived organic carbon in particulate matter was lower in the planted forest than in the natural forest, which could be due to allochthonous inputs of organic matter from rivers and creeks, and to a higher number of species in the natural forests. This study demonstrated that the amount of carbon stored in mangroves increases with age, but the amount of carbon stored in mangrove soils could vary with mangrove density, sediment size, allochthonous inputs, and inundation. This study suggested that planted and natural mangrove forests can capture and store a substantial amount of carbon. Such information could motivate policymakers and local communities to conserve the last remaining mangrove forests, rehabilitate ones, and abandoned fish and shrimp ponds.

TI  - Numerical Simulation of Aging by Water-Trees of XPLE Insulator Used in a Single Hi-Voltage Phase of Smart Composite Power Cables for Offshore Farms
AB  - Submarine power cables are expected to last 20 years without maintenance to be considered technologically reliable enough and economically beneficial. One of the main issues facing this target is the development of what is called commonly water-trees (nanometer-sized flaws filled with residual humidity), that form within XLPE (cross-linked Polyethylene) insulators and then migrate towards copper, thus leading to its corrosion and further to possible shut-down. Water trees are resulting from the coalescence of nanovoids filled with residual humidity that migrate towards copper under the combined effects of electrical forces and plastic deformation. The nanovoids are originated during manufacturing, shipping, handling and embedding in deep seas. The formation of these nanovoids leads to the degradation of the service lifetime of submarine power cables. Current research is intended to come up with a way to go a little further towards the generalization of coalescence of n nanovoids. In the perspective of multi-physics modeling, a preliminary 3D finite element model was built. Although water voids are distributed randomly inside XLPE, in this study, two extreme cases where the voids are present parallel and perpendicular to the copper surface, were considered for simplification. This will enable checking the electric field effect on neighbouring voids, in both cases as well as the influence of the proximity of the conductor on the plasticity of voids, that further leads to their coalescence. It is worthwhile to note that assessing water-trees formation and propagation through an experimental campaign of ageing tests may extend over decades. It would therefore be an exceptional opportunity to be able to get insight into this mechanism through numerical modeling that needs a much shorter time. The premilinary model suggested is expected to be extended in the future so that to include more variables (distribution and shapes of nano-voids, water pressure, molecular modeling, electric discharge.

TI  - Optimal sizing of stand-alone hybrid photovoltaic/wind system using BAT algorithm
AB  - This paper presents a new optimal sizing methodology for a stand-alone PV-wind hybrid (PWH) energy system that is serving the electricity demand for an offshore petroleum platform. A BAT optimisation technique is implemented to minimise the annualised cost of the system (ACS) considering power balance constraint and to determine the optimal number of PV panels, wind turbines and batteries. The comparison of BAT algorithm with Homer and particle swarm optimisation algorithm is done in this paper and it shows that BAT algorithm finds optimal sizing of PWH easily with lower cost. The results show that considering reliability characteristics has a major impact on optimal sizing, load supply level and cost.

TI  - Model-Based Assessment of the CO2 Sequestration Potential of Coastal Ocean Alkalinization
AB  - The potential of coastal ocean alkalinization (COA), a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) climate engineering strategy that chemically increases ocean carbon uptake and storage, is investigated with an Earth system model of intermediate complexity. The CDR potential and possible environmental side effects are estimated for various COA deployment scenarios, assuming olivine as the alkalinity source in ice-free coastal waters (about 8.6% of the global ocean's surface area), with dissolution rates being a function of grain size, ambient seawater temperature, and pH. Our results indicate that for a large-enough olivine deployment of small-enough grain sizes (10 Âµm), atmospheric CO2 could be reduced by more than 800 GtC by the year 2100. However, COA with coarse olivine grains (1000 Âµm) has little CO2 sequestration potential on this time scale. Ambitious CDR with fine olivine grains would increase coastal aragonite saturation Î© to levels well beyond those that are currently observed. When imposing upper limits for aragonite saturation levels (Î©lim) in the grid boxes subject to COA (Î©lim = 3.4 and 9 chosen as examples), COA still has the potential to reduce atmospheric CO2 by 265 GtC (Î©lim = 3.4) to 790 GtC (Î©lim = 9) and increase ocean carbon storage by 290 Gt (Î©lim = 3.4) to 913 Gt (Î©lim = 9) by year 2100.

TI  - Demand Forecasting for Liquified Natural Gas Bunkering by Country and Region Using Meta-Analysis and Artificial Intelligence
AB  - Ship exhaust emission is the main cause of coastal air pollution, leading to premature death from cardiovascular cancer and lung cancer. In light of public health and climate change concerns, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and several governments are reinforcing policies to use clean ship fuels. In January 2020, the IMO reduced the acceptable sulfur content in ship fuel to 0.5\% m/m (mass/mass) for sustainability. The use of liquified natural gas (LNG) as a ship fuel is currently the most likely measure to meet this regulation, and LNG bunkering infrastructure investment and network planning are underway worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this study is to predict the LNG bunkering demand for investment and planning. So far, however, there has been little quantitative analysis of LNG bunkering demand prediction. In this study, first, the global LNG bunkering demand was predicted using meta-regression analysis. Global demand for LNG bunkering is forecast to increase from 16.6 million tons in 2025 to 53.2 million tons in 2040. Second, LNG bunkering prediction by country and region was performed through analogy and artificial intelligence methods. The information and insights gained from this study may facilitate policy implementation and investments.

TI  - High-Grade silica refined from diatomaceous earth for solar-grade silicon production
AB  - A refining processing of high-purity silica from biogenic diatomaceous earth is newly proposed to exploit the steady and stable resource to the solar-power generation industry. The specimens collected from various representative diatomaceous earth deposits, including both marine and freshwater origin, were chemically analyzed. Trace element distribution in diatomaceous earth was influenced by the biotope habitat of diatoms, when compared to that in quartz of igneous origin. Al, K, and Fe were mainly terrestrially derived, while Siand B were from diatom shells. B content in diatomaceous earth specimens from lacustrine sources was lessthan that in marine origin. Diatomaceous earth was then dissolved into caustic alkaline solution. With a decreasing pH value, amorphous silica precipitated with impurities. Al and Fe were concentrated in silica precipitated in the pH range of 12.5-10.5, while B was more soluble than silica at pH less than 9. Silica can be precipitated in the pH range of 10.5-9.0, followed by acid leaching to reduce Al and Fe content. A simple chemical operation consisting of extraction, precipitation, and acid leaching has been proposed. Repetition ofchemical processing 3 times provides more than 5 N silica from diatomaceous earth samples from freshwatersource rocks. Â© 2009 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Review on the characteristics of vortex-induced vibration of marine risers [æµ·æ´‹ç«‹ç®¡æ¶¡æ¿€æŒ¯åŠ¨ç‰¹æ€§ç ”ç©¶ç»¼è¿°]
AB  - During the development of offshore oil and gas fields, marine risers, as important components connecting offshore platforms and subsea production systems, are subjected to loads from external multi-flow field, such as wind, waves and ocean currents all the year around. Therefore, vortex-induced vibration (VIV), which is generated inevitably, will result in riser fatigue and endanger production safety. As the water depth and aspect ratio increase, VIV becomes more complicated, further increasing the risk of riser fatigue, which makes marine riser VIV an urgent engineering problem in offshore oil and gas development. This paper summarizes the current research of riser VIV from the aspects of semi-empirical prediction model, VIV multimodal response and three-dimensional characteristics, effect of external wave, internal and external flow coupling, VIV characteristics of riser groups, and VIV suppression. Finally, the issues to be studied on marine risers are prospected. The research and analysis show that the study on the multi-modal response of risers with large aspect ratio and the vibration characteristics of risers under the coupling effect of internal multiphase flow and external wave is the key of future work.

TI  - Protection of Selected Cases: PV Systems, Wind Turbines and Railway Systems
AB  - The lightning protection and the surge protection of large ground-mounted photovoltaic power plants as well as of small roof-mounted photovoltaic systems is considered. Basics for external and internal lightning protection as well as special requirements, especially for surge protection, are presented. The measures result from experiences in the last years, are today recognized widely and are realized to a large extent. Lightning and surge protection of wind turbines has received increasing attention in recent decades due to considerable damage caused by direct lightning strikes. Today, onshore and offshore wind turbines are equipped with lightning protection systems according to the highest level of lightning protection and the declining damage shows the effectiveness of the measures. Special attention is paid to the protection of the rotor blades. But also surge protection for electrical energy and information technology systems including EMC measures is of great importance and is described. Many specialities have to be taken into account in the lightning and surge protection of wind turbines. For railway facilities and systems, national and international comprehensive concepts for lightning and surge protection have hardly been described. The considerations and measures presented here also do not claim to be complete, but are intended to address important aspects. These include above all measures for the protection of control and command technology systems as well as information on personal protection. In addition, lightning and surge protection of the power supply, measurement systems and EMC measures are addressed.

TI  - The development and field introduction of a Subsea wellhead connector for intervention operations
AB  - Subsea operations in general, attract significant expense; from the requirement of a multi-disciplinary team, through to the logistics of equipment and service conveyance in a harsh offshore enviroment. Costs are typically recovered through the reservoir production potential value over a number of years - this is not the case in abandonment operations. Upon cessation of production, the cost of abandonment is absorbed as a liability; as such the focus on cost efficiency is stringent and acute. It is however an area where the adoption of new and novel technology, allied to an alternative approach to service vessel selected and campaign structure, can achieve significant cost savings. This paper describes the development of a subsea wellhead connector intended for use in well abandonment operations, in rigless decommissioning projects conducted in the UK Continental Shelf. It presents one of alternative rigless approaches to field decommissioning, and through collaboration with operators, cost effective equipment is developed reactively to meet their operational requirements. Deviating from a Jack up/MODU based rig campaign to a Monohull based campaign has shown savings can be achieved through a significant reduction in vessel day rates and personnel costs. The requirement of rigless abandonment technologies and equipment is growing as the market adopts rigless abandonment; as such, collaboration is required to align equipment with operators requirements. The development of the Subsea Wellhead Connector (S WC) was undertaken and delivered in 29 days, with design, application, fabrication, and commissioning expedited to meet an aggressive operations schedule. A dedicated project team allied to robust internal engineering and testing programs, facilitated the delivery and leveraged over twenty years of lessons learned in subsea operations. The SWC is intended for Intervention and well abandonment operations, including: conveyance for mechanical and abrasive cutting, wellbore communication and testing, subsea tree (XT) installation, and well barrier verification, and wellhead retrieval. The SWC has now undertaken five campaigns in the first six months since its market entry, and displayed that collaboration and the pooling of creative talent, can provide tangible and discernible benefits to the stakeholders involved.

TI  - Wide-azimuth OBC Seismic Data Optimization for AVO and AVAz Analysis, Offshore Abu Dhabi, UAE
AB  - The lack of high-resolution subsurface images from poor seismic imaging quality leads to inaccurate AVO/AVAz analysis and fault interpretation, which are critical for reserves estimation and de-risking any imminent drilling decisions. In a developing filed, acquiring and processing a new seismic data often falls outside the time frame of ongoing field development, as it will require great efforts in overcoming logistics challenges along with additional costs. In this case study, in offshore Abu Dhabi, revisiting the vintage data with careful and detailed reprocessing whilst utilizing the latest technologies has proven to be an effective, practical and cost-efficient method in improving the fault resolution and reservoir characterization. In this case study, it is observed that the deeper events in the vintage data were masked by the strong surface wave energy. The irregular acquisition geometry of the seismic data caused the aliasing of the surface wave. The application of harsh de-noising techniques in the vintage processing further deteriorated the fault definition. Thus, to tackle the aliasing problem, 5D trace densification and regularization was applied to increase the input data and create a de-aliased surface wave model. This allowed for subsequent subtraction of the strong surface wave, without damaging the body wave. Further cascaded surface wave attenuation algorithm improved the image quality. Modern fault preserving residual noise attenuation was applied along with 5D Fourier reconstruction mitigated the residual noise content. It has been proven in the case study that multi-dimensional data densification and 5D reconstruction of the signal enhanced the fault delineation. By leveraging the modern signal-processing innovations, the final results produced a better overall reflection image focused on the angle/azimuth stacks suitable for fault interpretation, AVO and AVAz analysis. In conclusion, poorly vintage seismic data has been shown to possess a high value despite its irregular geometry and low resolution. Copyright 2020, International Petroleum Technology Conference.

TI  - A biotechnological expansion of shellfish cultivation could permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere [Una ampliaciÃ³n biotecnolÃ³gica del cultivo de moluscos bivalvos podrÃ­a eliminar permanentemente el diÃ³xido de carbono de la atmÃ³sfera]
AB  - To combat climate change, proposals have been made to develop methods that would pull carbon dioxide out of Earthâ€™s atmosphere. One recommended approach is to remove CO2 from the atmosphere with activities such as reforestation and changing forest management and agricultural practices to enhance soil carbon storage. However, it is also noted that such activities would limit land for food production and negatively affect biodiversity. Furthermore, decay of dead wood and fallen leaves in natural forests releases huge quantities of CO2 and other greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere. The only other carbon-sequestration technique that is widely considered is the application of CO2 capture processes to flue gases of power plants, which are responsible for about 80% of the worldwide CO2 emission from large stationary sources. Hydrate-based processing is a promising technology for CO2 capture as it results in high CO2 recovery, but its high cost prevents this technology having much impact. In this note I suggest that the ability of marine organisms (shellfish and coccolithophore algae) to remove permanently CO2 from the atmosphere into solid (crystalline) CaCO3 should be harnessed. I suggest that if the level of finance and effort that are readily anticipated for forest management and flue gas treatments were to be applied to expansion of shellfish cultivation around the world, significant amounts of carbon dioxide could be permanently removed from the atmosphere within the timescale that is currently envisaged for carbon capture by afforestation.

TI  - Flow chart
AB  - Mike Scott discusses how the close links between water and energy in UK ensure that efficiencies made in one sector have a beneficial effect in the other. Oil sands are at least 20 times as water-intensive as conventional fuels, while biofuels are thousands of times more water-hungry. The latest data suggest that shale gas is seven times more water-hungry than conventional production. Coal-fired power plants are heavy water users now, but if they are fitted with carbon capture and storage equipment, their water consumption could increase by 30-100%.The particular emphasis of the water issue varies among different energy sources. In the nuclear industry, the impact of large withdrawals and the return of water to rivers and other water courses that is warmer on marine organisms is the key factor. However, when it comes to shale gas and the hydraulic fracturing used to extract it, the debate focuses on drinking water quality.

TI  - Simple estimation methodology of leakage from ocean storage of CO2 for policy makers
AB  - This chapter develop a simple methodology to estimate amount of long-term leakage, which can be utilized by those who do not have sufficient simulation resources to create a basis for CO2 capture and storage (CCS) accounting. The leakage coefficients for estimation are derived based on storage curve calculated by each characteristic. These are location and depth of injection. The methodology can provide the first order estimate of leakage of classified ocean storage of CO2 that would be a basis for developing accounting methodology. In particular, this is intended to contribute to accounting rules for CO2 capture storage proposed by the research project discussed in the chapter. Moreover, project planners and policy makers would utilize the methodology to examine the feasibility of some CO2 ocean storage projects. Difficulty of defining the leakage in ocean storage is due to the reservoir's open structure against atmosphere and continuous interaction between ocean and atmosphere. Under the current inventory system, "emission" is supposed to be counted. When this concept of emission is applied to the leakage in ocean storage straightforwardly, emission or leakage, which means that injected CO2 into ocean reservoir is released to the atmosphere, would not be observed because the partial pressure of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than that of ocean constantly when viewed as a whole ocean and not local area, so that ocean consistently keeps absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere.

TI  - Energy management strategy of marine lithium batteries based on cyclic life
AB  - In recent years, pure electric ship research has become a hot spot in the field of ship research, and lithium battery packs are a major difficulty in the research of pure power ships. Especially the life and safety problems of lithium battery packs seriously affect the future practical application of ships. Therefore, the energy storage system is designed as two sets of lithium battery packs. While increasing the energy of the energy storage system, the power supply of the battery pack is ensured, which not only ensures the safety of the pure electric ship, but also reduces the aging reaction rate of the lithium battery pack. Through the multi-energy ship modeling, specifically related to the control and safe operation of lithium battery packs, a lithium battery pack energy management strategy is provided. The specific scheme is: the model of ship sailing mileage and SOC is established by the theory of energy conservation, the lithium battery aging model is obtained by the lithium battery data of the actual pure electric ship navigation, and the lithium battery pack energy switching based on the mileage aging battery model is proposed. The strategy uses a logic threshold optimization algorithm to reduce the aging rate of the lithium battery pack. Finally, the experimental results show that the lithium battery pack with energy management strategy can perform 400 more navigations when the capacity loss reaches 15\% in the same environment. It shows that this strategy is beneficial to improve the cycle life of lithium battery packs.

TI  - Decrease in the CO2 Uptake Capacity in an Ice-Free Arctic Ocean Basin
AB  - It has been predicted that the Arctic Ocean will sequester much greater amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere as a result of sea ice melt and increasing primary productivity. However, this prediction was made on the basis of observations from either highly productive ocean margins or ice-covered basins before the recent major ice retreat. We report here a high-resolution survey of sea-surface CO2 concentration across the Canada Basin, showing a great increase relative to earlier observations. Rapid CO2 invasion from the atmosphere and low biological CO2 drawdown are the main causes for the higher CO2, which also acts as a barrier to further CO2 invasion. Contrary to the current view, we predict that the Arctic Ocean basin will not become a large atmospheric CO2 sink under ice-free conditions.

TI  - Improved Oil Recovery by High Magnetic Flux Density Subjected to Iron Oxide Nanofluids
AB  - Oil recovery in offshore environments can be increased by using nanofluids with electromagnetic waves generated from an antenna in the oil reservoir. In the case of offshore environments, these constraints can be avoided if a horizontal antenna is towed close to the seabed, which maximises the electromagnetic energy transferred from the overburden to the reservoir and nanofluids in the reservoir. In this research, a new enhanced antenna is used with iron oxide (Fe2O3) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanofluids for oil recovery applications at the laboratory scale. In the antenna study, it was observed that the curve antenna with magnetic feeders gave a 1978\% increase in the magnetic field signal strength compared to the case without magnetic feeders. The curve antenna with magnetic feeders produced a 473\% increase in the electric field signal strength compared to the case without magnetic feeders. Iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanoparticles were prepared by the sol-gel method. The iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanoparticle sizes were in the range of 30.27-37.60 nm. FESEM and HRTEM images show that the samples have good crystallinity and that the grain size increased as temperature increased. Iron oxide (Fe2O3) samples sintered at 500 degrees C showed a high initial permeability and Q-factor and a low loss factor compared to samples sintered at 500 degrees C. The sample had a very high initial permeability and a low loss at low frequencies; therefore, it was suitable for the preparation of the nanofluid and oil recovery applications. Oil recovery through the usage of 0.1\% (w/w) iron oxide (Fe2O3) nanofluid with an EM field generated from the curve antenna with magnetic feeders was 33.45 \% of OOIP (original oil in place). In a similar case where 0.1 \% (w/w) zinc oxide (ZnO) nanofluid with an EM field was used, 22.46 \% of OOIP was recovered. These results imply that injecting 0.1\% w/w iron oxide nanofluid coupled to the curve antenna with magnetic feeders has potential for oil recovery for improved water flooding systems because the high magnetic flux density that acts on the nanoparticles is proportional to the magnetic field strength.

TI  - Integration of GF2 Optical, GF3 SAR, and UAV Data for Estimating Aboveground Biomass of China's Largest Artificially Planted Mangroves
AB  - Accurate methods to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) of mangroves are required to monitor the subtle changes over time and assess their carbon sequestration. The AGB of forests is a function of canopy-related information (canopy density, vegetation status), structures, and tree heights. However, few studies have attended to integrating these factors to build models of the AGB of mangrove plantations. The objective of this study was to develop an accurate and robust biomass estimation of mangrove plantations using Chinese satellite optical, SAR, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data based digital surface models (DSM). This paper chose Qi'ao Island, which forms the largest contiguous area of mangrove plantation in China, as the study area. Several field visits collected 127 AGB samples. The models for AGB estimation were developed using the random forest algorithm and integrating images from multiple sources: optical images from Gaofen-2 (GF-2), synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from Gaofen-3 (GF-3), and UAV-based digital surface model (DSM) data. The performance of the models was assessed using the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and relative RMSE (RMSEr), based on five-fold cross-validation and stratified random sampling approach. The results showed that images from the GF-2 optical (RMSE = 33.49 t/ha, RMSEr = 21.55\%) or GF-3 SAR (RMSE = 35.32 t/ha, RMSEr = 22.72\%) can be used appropriately to monitor the AGB of the mangrove plantation. The AGB models derived from a combination of the GF-2 and GF-3 datasets yielded a higher accuracy (RMSE = 29.89 t/ha, RMSEr = 19.23\%) than models that used only one of them. The model that used both datasets showed a reduction of 2.32\% and 3.49\% in RMSEr over the GF-2 and GF-3 models, respectively. On the DSM dataset, the proposed model yielded the highest accuracy of AGB (RMSE = 25.69 t/ha, RMSEr = 16.53\%). The DSM data were identified as the most important variable, due to mitigating the saturation effect observed in the optical and SAR images for a dense AGB estimation of the mangroves. The resulting map, derived from the most accurate model, was consistent with the results of field investigations and the mangrove plantation sequences. Our results indicated that the AGB can be accurately measured by integrating images from the optical, SAR, and DSM datasets to adequately represent canopy-related information, forest structures, and tree heights.

TI  - Unmanned Electric Tugboat Formation Multi-Agent Energy-Aware Control System Concept
AB  - The topic of reducing exhaust gas emissions from internal combustion engines in the areas of port and coastal waters is in line with the assumptions of the climate policy. The publication presents a proposal to reduce the energy associated with the movement of port vessels through the use of a specific pattern (shape and size) of their movement. In addition to controlling the formation of tugboats, the authors propose the use of a multi-agent system offering elements of autonomous control of the vessels, which adjusts the parameters of the formation depending on the tasks performed. The results of tests for four tugboats with a hull length of 32 m and a maximum speed of 13 knots, moving in formations of eight different configurations, were analyzed. Studies conducted on the basis of a simulated exit and return to port scenario at a distance of 11.4 nm showed the possibility of reducing energy consumption required for movement by 5.8% to even 57.6% for tugboats moving one after another, at a certain distance. In addition, in order to completely eliminate exhaust gas emissions from the engines, it is proposed to use tugboats with electric drive together with an appropriate energy storage charging infrastructure.

TI  - Field application of activated carbon amendment for in-situ stabilization of polychlorinated biphenyls in marine sediment
AB  - We report results on the first field-scale application of activated carbon (AC) amendment to contaminated sediment for in-situ stabilization of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The test was performed on a tidal mud flat at South Basin, adjacent to the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, San Francisco Bay, CA. The major goals of the field study were to (1) assess scale up of the AC mixing technology using two available, large-scale devices, (2) validate the effectiveness of the AC amendment at the field scale, and (3) identify possible adverse effects of the remediation technology. Also, the test allowed comparison among monitoring tools, evaluation of longer-term effectiveness of AC amendment, and identification of field-related factors that confound the performance of in-situ biological assessments. Following background pretreatment measurements, we successfully incorporated AC into sediment to a nominal 30 cm depth during a single mixing event, as confirmed by total organic carbon and black carbon contents in the designated test plots. The measured AC dose averaged 2.0-3.2 wt% and varied depending on sampling locations and mixing equipment. AC amendment did not impact sediment resuspension or PCB release into the water column over the treatment plots, nor adversely impact the existing macro benthic community composition, richness, or diversity. The PCB bioaccumulation in marine clams was reduced when exposed to sediment treated with 2% AC in comparison to the control plot. Field-deployed semi permeable membrane devices and polyethylene devices showed about 50% reduction in PCB uptake in AC-treated sediment and similar reduction in estimated pore-water PCB concentration. This reduction was evident even after 13-month post-treatment with then 7 months of continuous exposure, indicating AC treatment efficacy was retained for an extended period. Aqueous equilibrium PCB concentrations and PCB desorption showed an AC-dose response. Field-exposed AC after 18 months retained a strong stabilization capability to reduce aqueous equilibrium PCB concentrations by about 90%, which also supports the long-term effectiveness of AC in the field. Additional mixing during or after AC deployment, increasing AC dose, reducing AC-particle size, and sequential deployment of AC dose will likely improve AC-sediment contact and overall effectiveness. The reductions in PCB availability observed with slow mass transfer under field conditions calls for predictive models to assess the long-term trends in pore-water PCB concentrations and the benefits of alternative in-situ AC application and mixing strategies.

TI  - Digitalization and data democratization in offshore drilling
AB  - Digitalization involves the use of digital technologies to improve, or create new, business processes that drive operational efficiencies. Moreover, the concept of data democratization allows the fruition of digitalization; the data sources, data processes, and content, to be leveraged and scaled enterprise wide. Visualization and self-service analytics platforms allow all levels of business more autonomous ability to analyze and communicate data driven solutions to decision makers and those responsible for implementation. Driving toward digital transformation, modern digitalization strategies include aspects of data democratization. Data content is shared across the enterprise. Entire organizations have access to the raw data sources and data processes in addition to the produced report or visualization itself. This data democratization is the key to reducing replicated work, removing silos, and developing a social network for leveraging the hard data efforts of one business entity for efficient use in another. Results, observations, and conclusions, as well as solution specifics, will be presented with a series of use cases within the offshore drilling industry. These use cases are: â€¢ Digitalization of Rig Activity Performance KPIs using data enablement platforms to build the first version of an interactive Performance Dashboard. Democratized results of this exercise allowed user defined performance measures to be developed specific to proposed customer well specs. These performance measures were quickly analyzed and presented in contract tenders. â€¢ Digitalizing downtime events and maintenance history reports using data enabling visualization and self-service analytics platforms for flexible and efficient analysis identifying Reliability Improvement Initiatives and Maintenance Optimization opportunities in support of a company's Failure Reporting, Analysis, and Corrective Action System processes. â€¢ Digitalizing the Cost of Quality KPIs for use in Vendor Scorecards using easily filterable reports and automated distribution of daily updates.

TI  - Mechanically intensified and stabilized MXene membranes via the combination of graphene oxide for highly efficient osmotic power production
AB  - Harnessing the osmotic energy from the salt concentration gradient between sea water and river water in nature represents as a promising sustainable power generation pathway that does not generate waste and CO2 emission. However, the current membranes with two-dimensional nano-channels generally have low mechanical strength, poor stability, and low transmission power efficiency, which result into low current and power density (â‰¤1 W mâˆ’2) performance. Herein, we use MXene combined with GO (MXene/GO) to synthesize a composite membrane as a high-performance nanofluid permeability generator. The addition of 2D flexible GO membrane enhances the mechanical strength to achieve the required robustness of the composite membrane for practical application. By using river and sea water in the permeability generator, the power density for the MXene/GO composite membrane with 6 wt% GO can reach 3.7 W mâˆ’2 at room temperature (298 K). The influences of different GO ratio, pH, temperature, and membrane thickness on power density are also evaluated.

TI  - Design Principles Behind the Construction of an Autonomous Laboratory-Scale Drilling Rig
AB  - In recent years, hot topics such as digitalization, machine learning, digital twin and big data have evolved from being envisions on the paper to state of art solutions, expected to revolutionize drilling efficiency in the industry. Drilling automation tomorrow is all about exploiting the current state of technologies available to the entire operation of drilling a well. Not only can drilling automation limit costs and reduce the risk to rig personnel and the environment, but they also give access to locations of considerable potential that previously have been regarded unsafe or uneconomical to operate in. There are however some challenges in keeping up with the ever-increasing pace of the development. For one, testing of novel and innovative solutions is often very expensive because of non-productive rig time during implementation, trial runs and data evaluation. Also, the modern technologies require extensive R\&D before on-site testing can even commence. While on land-rigs, some of these costs and risks can be greatly minimized, many offshore solutions lack that luxury. This paper presents an overview of the design principles that go into the construction of a fully autonomous laboratory-scale drilling rig at the University of Stavanger. It aims at describing 1) the engineering principles involved to resemble full-scale drilling operations on the laboratory scale, 2) design considerations and components, 3) component requirements for the rig, 4) control system algorithms for real-time optimization of drilling parameters and detection and handling of drilling anomalies, 5) development of drilling models (drill string dynamics, bit-vibration, etc.) and 6) benefits and future work with the laboratory-scale system. Some of the concepts that are presented in this paper have yet to be implemented during 2018. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mass transfer processes of a hydrate-covered deep CO2 lake
AB  - By means of an autoclaved, hydrodynamically calibrated flux chamber, the mass transfer coefficient kCO2 of carbon dioxide CO2 across a smooth hydrate-seawater interface is determined for friction velocities &lt;1cms-1 at 30 and 40MPa and 2-4Â°C. In contrast to methane, kCO2 follows mixed-convection laws, requiring for increasing friction velocity u* metastable saturation values. At values u*0.4cms-1, mechanical strain on the hydrate film may generate an added hydrate debris or microdrop entrainment function. A quantitative data reduction chain is applied which shows that for the tidal range tested, mass transfer coefficients lie in the range 3Ã—10-6&lt;kCO2(u*)&lt;30Ã—10-6 m s-1. It is found that the climate gases CH4 and CO2 are not similar in their hydrate characteristics and formulae to predict the dissolution process, yet both can be quantified now on a macroscopic level.

TI  - An extensive design approach integrating offshore residential buildings and solar collectors
AB  - Utilization of energy has boosted socio-economic development but meanwhile exacerbated the environmental problems. Offshore areas in China boast abundant solar energy resources. The present work explores the application of solar energy in offshore residential buildings and the ways for integration of solar collectors with the buildings to analyze the potential impact of installation of solar collectors on the design of offshore residential buildings. An extensive design approach that introduces protruding features, outdoor air-conditioner unit spaces, and â€œvirtualâ€ elements into design of residential buildings was proposed, which would integrate the solar collectors into the architectural design and extend the functions of the residential buildings. This research aims to provide a theoretical basis for promoting utilization of solar energy and integrated design of offshore buildings.

TI  - Microalgae starch: A promising raw material for the bioethanol production
AB  - Ethanol is currently the most successful biofuel and can be produced from microalgal biomass (third-generation). Ethanol from microalgal biomass has advantages because it does not use arable land and reduces environmental impacts through the sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere. In this way, micro and macroalgal starch, which is structurally similar to that from higher plants can be considered a promise raw material for the production of bioethanol. Thus, strategies can be used to intensify the carbohydrate concentration in the microalgal biomass enabling the production of third-generation bioethanol. The microalgae biomass can be destined to biorefineries so that the residual biomass generated from the extraction processes is used for the production of high value-added products. Therefore, the process will have an impact on reducing the production costs and the generation of waste. In this context, this review aims to bring concepts and perspectives on the production of third-generation bioethanol, demonstrating the microalgal biomass potential as a carbon source to produce bioethanol and supply part of the world energy demand. The main factors that influence the microalgal cultivation and fermentation process, aswell as the processes of transformation of biomass into the easily fermentable substrate are also discussed.

TI  - Resilience-Oriented Energy Management for All-Electric Ships Considering Safe Return
AB  - Marine power systems are isolated from external grids, making them more vulnerable than land-based power system. Additionally, different from fixed terrestrial microgrids, all-electric ships are mobile transportation vehicles, complying with the regulation of safe return to port. In order to enhance the resilience and improve energy efficiency of mobile microgrid, this study proposes a two-stage economic and resilient optimization framework for an all-electric ship (AES), taking into account the impact of navigation. In the first stage, a joint voyage and power scheduling of the AES is developed to reduce the operation costs and greenhouse gas emissions for normal operation mode. In the second stage, resilience-oriented optimization is proposed to defend the extreme contingency by optimizing the navigation speed and load shedding. Furthermore, resistance during the whole AES navigation is also considered. To verify the proposed algorithm, several cases are compared to demonstrate the resilience and economy of the shipboard power system and the necessity of addressing the effect of sailing resistance on the AES voyage.

TI  - Long pile upending lifting study for fixed platform on offshore oil and gas field
AB  - Fixed platform have been widely employed in the offshore oil and gas reservoirs development. Pile foundation reliability is critical for these platforms where drilling, production and other functions are integrated. The lifting operation for the long pile, being a key step in the jacket installation, has been considered for further developments. With deep water developments, the sizes and weights of long piles are reasonably bigger. The corresponding process and equipment employed are subsequently altered, which brings challenges to developing a cost-effective, easy-operable approach for lifting operation. In this paper, the technology for the offshore long pile upending lifting operation including pile feature, installation methodology, lifting rigging and analysis model, covering water depths ranging from shallow to near deep water zone (60-300 m water depth) has been suggested. In addition, the applicability of the adoptable novel approaches has been discussed considering the practical project experience. Copyright Â© 2014 by ASME.

TI  - An unintended ecological benefit from human intervention: The enhancement of carbon storage in seagrass meadows
AB  - Human interventions have had unintended consequences for the diverse functions of various ecosystems. Hydrological interventions have the potential to alter vegetated habitats in coastal nearshore ecosystems, but little is known about the impacts on organic carbon (Corg) sequestration, which plays an important role in climate change mitigation. We examined the effects of past human interventions through artificial inlet opening in a lagoonal seagrass meadow. The sediment profiles of geological and biogeochemical characteristics were measured to obtain the historical changes in the lagoon environment and Corg accumulation rates. Isotopic and elemental signatures and diatom assemblages showed that the interventions increased the duration of seawater exchanges and the extent of the seagrass meadow. Corg accumulation rates increased more than 1.9-fold after the intervention, resulting in additional Corg storage in the seagrass meadow during last 64Â years. Synthesis and applications. Artificial opening of tidal inlet can potentially provide unintended ecological benefits, such as increased carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows. Hydrological interventions could be undertaken intentionally as a potential active intervention to sequester carbon, as well as control flood risk and provide other benefits to people in estuarine systems. Our results illustrate that physical factors such as improving salinity conditions and mineral particle supply have an impact on the feasibility of hydrological interventions for enhancing carbon sequestration. We propose that biogeochemicalâ€“physical coupled approach will help stakeholders to evaluate the ecological and social risks and synergies of implementing hydrological interventions.

TI  - Adjustment of the natural ocean carbon cycle to negative emission rates
AB  - Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is the only geoengineering technique that allows negative emissions and the reduction of anthropogenic carbon in the atmosphere. Since the time scales of the global carbon cycle are largely driven by the exchanges with the natural oceanic stocks, the implementation of CDR actions is anticipated to create outgassing from the ocean that may reduce their efficiency. The adjustment of the natural carbon cycle to CDR was studied with a numerical Earth System Model, focusing on the oceanic component and considering two idealized families of CDR policies, one based on a target atmospheric concentration and one based on planned negative emissions. Results show that both actions are anticipated to release the anthropogenic carbon stored in the surface ocean, effectively increasing the required removal effort. The additional negative emissions are expected to be lower when the CDR policy is driven by planned removal rates without prescribing a target atmospheric CO2 concentration. Â© 2013 The Author(s).

TI  - Hydrodynamic implications of large offshore mussel farms
AB  - Around 3000 Ha of New Zealand's coastal waters are presently allocated to mussel farming of the Greenshell mussel Perna canaliculus mainly in small inshore farms of 30 000 to 80 000 m2 each. The farms are constructed from blocks of parallel moored long-lines, with loops of spat-impregnated line hanging vertically in the upper 10-15 m of the water column (provided sufficient water depth). When fully laden, the mussel loops can present a rough diameter of 0.20 m or more to the flow. Industry expansion is likely to be in the form of larger offshore farms. Some of the larger proposed farms will have more than 1000 km of mussel line. This presents a potentially significant drag to currents and waves. In this paper, observations are used from one of the first large offshore farms constructed in New Zealand, in conjunction with scaling estimates of energy loss, to investigate the effect of the farm on waves, currents, and stratification. The farm, consisting of 230 long-lines arranged into 20 blocks, measured 650 m Ã— 2450 m. The hanging mussel loops at this site reached an average depth of 8 m, and water depth at midtide varied across the site from 10-12 m. Transects were taken through the farm using both conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD), and Acoustic Doppler Profiler (ADP) instruments. A second ADP was moored inside the farm providing velocity time series. The average current was reduced within the farm by 36%-63%. The moored ADP detected an undercurrent beneath the farm with velocities nearly twice that within the farm. Sharp changes in stratification coincide with the start of fully stocked mussel long-lines. Furthermore, other than at the very upstream end of the farm, stratification appears to have prevented significant vertical mixing between the fluid within the farm and that flowing under the farm. Wave energy was low during the 7-d deployment, with significant wave heights peaking at 0.25 m. The attenuation of transitional waves through the farm is examined by comparing simultaneous pressure sensor measurements from offshore and inshore of the farm. The observations show that wave energy attenuation was frequency dependent. Observed wave energy attenuation across the 650 m wide farm was approximately 5%, 10%, and 17% at wave frequencies of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.25 Hz, respectively. Â© 2005 IEEE.

TI  - Holistic approach for the design of drill-in fluid
AB  - Drilling wells in mature fields normally entails the integration of multidisciplinary teams to increase the likelihood of a successful drilling and completion program. Maximizing wellbore productivity requires thoughtful planning involving analysis, studies, and risk assessment of the best alternative solutions for well drilling and completion. Selecting reservoir drilling and completion fluid to minimize rock formation damage requires a high level of consideration. Selecting an appropriate fluid strategy becomes more significant when the reservoir section involves horizontal drilling and an openhole completion design. This paper details the design criteria and final application of a nondamaging drill-in fluid to drill a horizontal well completed as open hole in a mature field (first of its kind in the field). The fluid design strategy was driven based on analysis of reservoir rock samples, reservoir fluid chemistry analysis, and the natural permeability of selected core samples. The fluid selected was a monovalent brine system using highly clarified and acid-soluble biopolymers as filtrate reducer and viscosity control, respectively, and an engineered and tested bridging package based on sized calcium carbonate. The fluid also contained an amphoteric amine to control clay swelling and dispersion. The nature of the well completion used an in-situ acid-generating filter-cake breaker system for removal of filter cake and damage encountered during reservoir drilling or completion. The filter-cake breaker system also affected fluid design (e.g., compatibility between the two systems), which was incorporated into the design strategy. Additionally, the nature of certain details of the completion architecture affected the breaker system application and was necessary to redesign the filter-cake breaker system to achieve optimal wellbore cleanup while accommodating constraints in the completion design and operation. Finally, application of the fluid program used with the drilling and completion design and architecture rendered a successful project resulting in higher than expected hydrocarbon output.

TI  - CO2 sequestration in deepwater sediments offshore Japan
AB  - When injected in deep saline aquifers or depleted oil and gas reservoirs, supercritical CO2 remains mobile and can, therefore, migrate through any conduits or fractures. In addition, public opinion, regulations and the lack of space for CO2 injection in some densely populated regions of the world such as the Japanese archipelago encourage investigating other alternatives such as carbon dioxide sequestration in deepwater sub-seabed formations. This paper intends to present a technical feasibility study of CO2 sequestration in deepwater sediments offshore Japan. The main processes, technical requirements, technologies and structures that are currently available to transport and inject liquid CO2 successfully in sub-seabed formations below 9,000 feet of water (â‰ˆ2,750 meters) are first discussed. Then, three storage sites situated offshore Japan; one located in the Northwest Pacific Ocean near the island of Shikoku; another located in the Sea of Japan near the island of Honshu; and the last one located farther in the Northwest Pacific Ocean in ultra-deepwater (18,000 feet); are selected to conduct reservoir simulations. From this study, it appears that CO2 capturing technologies and transporting means seem to be at a mature stage. Also, current and newest 5th and 6th generation drilling vessels are estimated to be capable of drilling very shallow wells in water depths greater than 9,000 feet and even in ocean waters as deep as 18,000 feet if new materials such as titanium or composite for riser systems were to be deployed for both the drilling and CO2 injection operations. However, CO2 storing and injection facilities are not available yet to unload large quantities of CO2 offshore. As a result, some concepts should be designed, qualified and tested for these large scale operations within the next decade to demonstrate through pilot projects the technical feasibility of CO2 sequestration in sub-seabed geological formations. Additionally, the main findings from this comparative study and reservoir simulations conducted at three different sites located offshore Japan confirm that a significant part of ultra-deepwater regions with at least 9,000 feet of ocean water and planar seafloor are appropriate for CO2 storage. Secondly, reservoir models confirm that due to high pressures and low temperatures reigning at water depths greater than 9,000 feet, the liquid CO2 injected in the first few hundred feet of sediments has a higher density than the surrounding formation pore-fluid and therefore remains buoyantly trapped under certain condition of geothermal gradient, sediments permeability and formation pressure and; hence constitute a valid and safe CO2 storage candidate.

TI  - Spatial distribution of an invasive plant Spartina alterniflora and its potential as biofuels in China
AB  - Spartina alterniflora, an invasive plant, has caused enormous ecological consequences since it was introduced to China over 30 years ago. However, as a potential bioenergy plant, it has obvious advantages. Therefore, it is academically important to study its spatial distribution and bioenergy potentials. The present research, using the remote sensing data from China and Brazil earth resources satellite (CBERS), coupled with data from related literature, concludes that the total area covered by the herb in China reaches 34,178ha, mainly in eastern Jiangsu Province, Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province, accounting for 94.22% of the country's total. Its total annual biomass reaches 2.53Mt, producing 39 PJ bioenergy, equivalent to that of 1.33Mt of standard coal. The annual biomass of its above-ground parts is 1.12Mt, producing 18 PJ bioenergy, equivalent to that of 0.61Mt of standard coal. Besides, it also has strong carbon sequestration capabilities, its annual C stock amounting to 1.16Mt, or 4.25Mt of CO2. Therefore it is very significant for the carbon cycle of the ocean ecosystem.

TI  - Hydrate-based CO2 sequestration technology: Feasibilities, mechanisms, influencing factors, and applications
AB  - CO2 is the primary contributor to greenhouse gas that causes rapid global warming. CO2 capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is a crucial technology for CO2 reduction, typically, CO2 hydrates form at pressures and temperatures greater than 3 MPa and lower than 10 Â°C. These non-harsh environmental conditions determine the value of hydrate-based CO2 sequestration technology, which can be used as a potential effective sequestration measure. In addition, hydrates have the advantages of rapid formation kinetics, high stability, and a low probability of gas leakage; therefore, they can be used to sequester CO2 in the near future. In this review, we summarize the development status and existing problems of various hydrate-based CO2 sequestration methods and analyze the mechanisms, influencing factors, and appropriate sequestration locations. The paper focuses on the CO2 replacement reaction of CH4 hydrates technology. The feasibility of this method is discussed in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics, the mechanism and influencing factors of the replacement process are analyzed, and various methods to improve the replacement efficiency are illustrated, including the temperature and pressure conditions, the injection phase state of CO2, the use of additives, and the assistance of other gases (N2 and H2). Next, the method of direct injection of CO2 into marine sediments to form hydrates for sequestration is discussed. We also generalize appropriate sequestration locations and summarize experimental and simulation studies on CO2 sequestration in marine sediments, including the technical feasibility, sequestration mechanism, and influencing factors. In addition, the hydrate cap is also discussed. Finally, we briefly introduce a hydrate-based CO2 sequestration method for reusing depleted deposits. This review paper can provide insights for future research and may help accelerate the field application of the hydrate method for CO2 sequestration technology. Â© 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Renewable energy and biodiversity: Implications for transitioning to a Green Economy
AB  - This literature review identifies the impacts of different renewable energy pathways on ecosystems and biodiversity, and the implications of these impacts for transitioning to a Green Economy. While the higher penetration of renewable energy is currently the backbone of Green Econotny efforts, an emerging body of literature demonstrates that the renewable energy sector can affect ecosysteins and biodiversity. The current review synthesizes the existing knowledge at the interface of renewable energy and biodiversity accross the five drivers of ecosystem change and biodiversity loss of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework (i.e. habitat loss/change, pollution, overexploitation, climate change and introduction of invasive species). It identifies the main impact mechanisms for different renewable energy pathways, including solar, wind, hydro, ocean, geothermal and bioenergy. Our review demonstrates that while all reviewed renewable energy pathways are associated (directly or indirectly) with each of the five MA drivers of ecosystem change and biodiversity loss, the actual impact mechanisms depend significantly between the different pathways, specific technologies and the environmental contexts within which they operate. With this review we do not question the fundamental logic of renewable energy expansion as it has been shown to have high environmental and socio-economic benefits. However, we want to make the point that some negative impacts on biodiversity do exist, and need to be considered when developing renewable energy policies. We put these findings into perspective by illustrating the major knowledge/practices gaps and policy implications at the interface of renewable energy, biodiversity conservation and the Green Economy.

TI  - The place of the rochdale envelope approach in offshore renewable energy
AB  - With ever-increasing pressure to produce low carbon energy, the offshore renewables industry is growing at a rapid rate. However, with the currently lengthy process from pre-application to obtaining development consent in England, it can take a number of years from securing a Crown Estate lease to obtaining development consent. During this time, the offshore renewables industry is capable of making significant improvements to technology, producing more efficient and larger models. In order to accommodate for emerging new technology within pre-existing offshore renewable development consent applications, a planning approach conceived by case law the Rochdale envelope approach has been transplanted into the planning process for offshore renewables allowing developers to describe their project using general parameters that cater for uncertainties at the time of application. However, with little official guidance, developers have been left to advance the approach in such a way that suits their needs. This article will outline the problems of the current application of the Rochdale envelope approach, and will argue that, if left unchanged, these problems will significantly impede the applications of future developers wishing to construct. The article proposes recommendations to guarantee further development of the offshore renewables industry with fewer regulatory impediments. Â© The Author(s).

TI  - Design and construction of the Cadet-M unmanned marine platform using alternative energy
AB  - Environmental monitoring has become an urgent task in recent years in connection with the deterioration of the environmental situation caused by industrialization [1]. Usually, manned vessels with measuring equipment and personnel serving it on board were used for these purposes, but with the development of technology, full automation of this process became possible. The problem of the need to use human resources is solved by applying an autonomous vessel control system. However, the big problem remains, which is the need to refuel the vessel in connection with the finite amount of stored energy. This problem is solved by using renewable energy, an example of which is solar energy, on measuring platforms. This article will discuss methods for developing platforms controlled by the autopilot and using solar energy, using the Cadet-M platform as an example.

The terrifying experience showed the extreme vulnerability of the region and the dramatic impacts it had. Resiliency is an urgent goal. Under the resiliency umbrella is energy and water efficiency and sustainability. There have been numerous discussions by Engineers and International Organizations on the importance of developing Climate Resilient facilities in the hurricane prone Caribbean. Regarding energy, the trend has been to incorporate Solar PV with Battery Storage and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems. The authors have interviewed businesses, government agencies and people who have experienced the recent hurricanes in 2017 and have analyzed the information and have developed strategies essential for businesses to achieve Climate Resilience and Business Continuity. This paper will identify critical elements needed to enable a Caribbean business to achieve Climate Resilience and indicate the importance of hybrid Energy Efficiency (EE), Renewable Energy (RE) and Clean Natural Gas (LNG) solutions in attaining this goal. Besides the need for the EE, RE & LNG hybrid solutions the paper indicates the importance of water and communication to Climate Resilience and shows the synergies and improved efficiencies when a holistic and sustainable Climate Resilience model is developed with all individual components combined.

TI  - Optimal energy hub development to supply heating, cooling, electricity and freshwater for a coastal urban area taking into account economic and environmental factors
AB  - In this paper, the design and performance of an energy hub to supply the demands of heating, cooling, electricity and freshwater for a coastal urban is considered. The modeling framework considers exergy and economic factors as well as greenhouse gas emissions. To optimally meet the demands of the energy hub, the consumed energy flows and their exchanges with the outside of the hub are determined. The optimization problem will be solved according to the environmental conditions, demands and design parameters of energy hub equipment. A comprehensive thermodynamic analysis of the energy hub is considered in order to take into account the economic and emissions outlook, along with renewable energy sources. In this study, two levels of integrated system modeling are simulated as â€œdesignâ€ and â€œenvironmental-designâ€ to optimize the energy hub with high accuracy. The results showed that the microturbine capacity decreased during the hours of sun exposure and power generation by the solar panels. As the heat generated by the Photovoltaic/Thermal (PV/T) system increases, the contribution of the adsorption chiller in cooling demand has increased. After performing optimization, the total annual costs in the urban area decreased by 30%, exergy efficiency increased by 28%, and carbon dioxide emissions decreased by 16%. Â© 2021

TI  - Growing greener regions
AB  - In 2007, the population of the United States reached 300 million; that of the globe recently hit 6 billion. Climate change and ecological damage unparalleled in recent history echoed these milestones. Storms have become more erratic and extreme. The first plot of habitable land recently gave way to rising sea levels in coastal India. Deforestation, desertification, and sprawling development are drastically reducing the world's biological diversity and available arable land. Global warming is no longer under dispute. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change links human behavior with higher land and ocean temperatures and rising sea levels over the past century and into the future (IPCC 2007). The greatest impetus for growing greener is thus the impending crises stemming from climate change. Human activities are responsible for many of these ecological problems. For example, in America's Appalachian region and other mining districts around the world, miners eliminated mountains, filled river valleys, and left gaping holes carved into the earth's crust to reach the underlying natural resources. The use of fossil fuels for transport and manufacturing concentrates pollution in the air, oceans, animals, and, most worrisome, in those who use them and their children. Just as humans have created these problems, they can also relieve them by promoting greener patterns of growth. Most important, they can reduce the demand for energy through promoting green regional design to achieve a greater balance between the built and natural environments, curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Intervention at the regional scale is not only feasible but also necessary to counteract the dangers of climate change. In this essay we define the key aspects of green regional design. We then use the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut metropolitan area as a case study of the application of regional design, detailing its use in the creation of open space, transportation (and related land uses) and energy networks that frame an area's growth and development. We show how it makes the area more livable and competitive while addressing global warming. Copyright Â© 2008 University of Pennsylvania Press.

TI  - Green hydrogen as an alternative fuel for the shipping industry
AB  - There is growing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from maritime transportation. One of the most effective strategies for reducing GHG emissions is to switch from conventional fuels such as heavy fuel oil to alternative fuels. Green hydrogen is a promising alternative for the shipping industry. Nonetheless, its potential usage will depend on more than its environmental friendliness. Economic, technical, and safety factors must be assessed. This paper provides a critical assessment of the potential usage of green hydrogen in the shipping industry with an evaluation of production routes, techno-economic performance, storage, and safety. Benchmarking is also carried out compared to existing â€˜greyâ€™ and â€˜blueâ€™ production routes specific to shipping industry applications. Important metrics for liquid hydrogen are analyzed to evaluate production cost and GHG emissions for various routes. Furthermore, a comparison is made for the safety and health issues of hydrogen compared to conventional and emerging maritime shipping fuels. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - A risk-based framework for Measurement, Monitoring and Verification (MMV) of the Goldeneye storage complex for the Peterhead CCS project, UK
AB  - CO2 emissions from the Peterhead CCS gas power plant were planned to be captured, compressed and transported offshore to be injected at a rate of 1 million tons per year for up to 20 years into the depleted Goldeneye hydrocarbon gas field. Although site selection, characterization and engineering designs are considered the prime means of ensuring confidence in the long-term security of CO2 storage, demonstration that they are performing is provided by a comprehensive risk-based Measurement, Monitoring and Verification (MMV) program. The Goldeneye MMV program was designed according to a systematic site-specific storage containment risk assessment to (1) demonstrate containment, (2) monitor for conformance, (3) provide data for emission accounting, and (4) support storage transfer of long-term liabilities. The MMV design process identified a set of appropriate monitoring tasks and candidate monitoring technologies needed to perform them based on comprehensive site-specific feasibility studies. This procedure reduced forty-five candidate monitoring technologies by half to result in a fit-for-purpose monitoring plan that satisfied UK and EU regulations while using less than fifteen different containment and environmental monitoring techniques.

TI  - Geological sequestration of carbon dioxide: Implications for the coal industry
AB  - A typical medium-size coal-fired power plant produces about 600 t CO2 per hour, or more than 4 000 000 t/year. Because of its high carbon content the CO2 emissions of coal are almost double those of natural gas per kilowatt of energy produced. This has clear implications for the continued use of coal as a fuel in power plants in a world increasingly conscious of greenhouse gas emissions. Underground sequestration of carbon dioxide is a viable method of storing industrial quantities of CO2, such as might be separated from the flue gases of a power plant. Indeed, Statoil is currently injecting 1 000 000 t/year CO2 from the Sleipner West gas field into porous and permeable reservoir rocks beneath the North Sea. The main barriers to the implementation of CO2 sequestration from power plants are financial; approximately 85% of the cost is incurred in separation of the CO2 from the flue gas. More research and development in this field are urgently required to develop the prospect of coal-fired power generation in the twenty-first century with minimum emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere.

TI  - Deep-sea nodules versus land ores: A comparative systems analysis of mining and processing wastes for battery-metal supply chains
AB  - To meet UN Sustainable Development goals, a clean-energy transition with minimal ecological impact from its raw-material supply chain is essential. Polymetallic nodules lying unattached on the abyssal seafloor of the Pacific Ocean's Clarion Clipperton Zone contain four critical metals (nickel, cobalt, manganese, copper) in large quantities, and the International Seabed Authority may soon enact regulations to allow their commercial exploitation. There are complex global ecological implications of doing so. Nodule exploitation would damage abyssal habitats and may impact midwater-column organisms; but in the absence of nodule exploitation, terrestrial mining's environmental and social impacts would intensify. This paper adds to the growing systems-based literature on nodule collection by contributing a preliminary material flow analysis of global-average cradle-to-gate waste streams using either nodules or terrestrial sources as part of a preliminary life cycle assessment, as well as integrated risk assessments of those waste streams. System endpoints are battery precursors (nickel sulfate, cobalt sulfate, manganese sulfate), copper cathode, and a 40% or 75% manganese product. Overburden, tailings, and processing and refining wastes from terrestrial mining are compared to the nodule industry's anticipated offshore and onshore wastes, including sediment disrupted by nodule-collection machines. Robustness to offshore technology assumptions is tested using Monte Carlo simulation, while onshore mass-flow scenarios incorporate a â€œnegligible-wasteâ€ flowsheet and high-waste flowsheets where manganese is not recovered. A billion-EV scenario incorporates the effects of declining terrestrial copper and nickel ore grades. Results imply that metal production from nodules may produce less waste of lower severities, caveated by uncertain impacts of disrupted sediment. Â© 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Bioeconomy: Markets, Implications, and Investment Opportunities
AB  - In order to achieve the objectives of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, the conversion of our economy, which is still dominated by fossil carbon, to the bioeconomy model must be completed by 2050. This requires a shift from oil, gas and coal to agricultural, forestry and marine raw materials and will affect the global processing chains for energy, fuels and chemicals. However, the land required for the production of raw materials is competing with the production of food and animal feed. In addition, future land use must better take into account planetary boundaries and the preservation of ecosystem services. In order to achieve economic, ecological and societal sustainability, the necessary measures must therefore be geared towards the UN's sustainability goals. Against this background, the future bioeconomy will have to concentrate on the food, chemical and heavy fuel sectors. Important sub-areas are alternative animal protein for nutrition, feedstock efficiency in the processing of bio-based raw materials, and the expansion of the raw materials spectrum. This requires enormous investment in industrial facilities, the integration of newly emerging value chains and the necessary infrastructure. The annual global investment requirements for renewable energy, bio-based chemicals and fuels, and ecosystem services is estimated at USD 1-2 trillion over the next three decades, equivalent to about 1.3-2.6\% of global GDP. This article discusses the implications and guard rails of the bioeconomy model, as well as capital needs and possible sources.

TI  - Subsea field development schemes integrating subsea chemical storageand injection systems: Benefits and challenges for long tiebacks
AB  - Chemical injection in subsea fields is a consolidated practice to solve or prevent flow assurance issues thatmay occur linked to hydraulic, thermal and operability requirements, especially in transient conditions. The traditional approach adopted to supply chemicals to a subsea tieback is to position the chemicalinjection system, including pumps and storage, on the platform/FPSO, transporting the chemicals subseathrough the umbilical or the chemical lines in case of high flow rates, and performing chemical distributionsubsea up to the injection points. In the development of a long subsea tieback, costs for the umbilical system tend to increase basedon its length and complexity. Moreover, pressure drops and control of chemical delivery pressures andflowrates through such a long umbilical can be extremely challenging, together with the risk of umbilicalline blockages and their related issues. The design resolution to enlarge the diameter of the chemical conduits in umbilicals leads to an increasein unit weights and, combined with the umbilical length, additional costs and packing and installationchallenges. These factors drive the need to review the conventional chemical injection system architecture and tomake the development of a long tieback sustainable from the point of view of cost and technology. To overcome these major criticalities, the chemical injection system can be placed subsea, possibly closeto the injection points. Recently, Saipem has mapped the typical chemical demand for a representative size oil fields, with themain aim of defining a subsea chemical injection system architecture and its related main components. The main result of this exercise is the definition of a configurable architecture for subsea chemical storage,injection and refilling facilities to be located close to the subsea users, based on operating considerationsuitable for offshore and deepwater scenarios. A "building block" approach is followed together with a certain degree of equipment standardization,where possible, allowing for a flexible system that can be adapted and tailored to the specific field.Technology development status has been also considered and specific Saipem technologies, currently underqualification or being patented, have been considered and integrated in the concept.

TI  - New design of lightweight flexible pipe for offshore oil offloading transfer
AB  - Spread moored FPSO (Floating Production and Storage Off-loading) vessels are typically used in the large West African oil fields. The oil from these vessels is transferred to shuttle tankers via an Oil Loading Terminal(OLT). This usually consists of 2 to 3 flexible offloading lines installed between the FPSO and a Single Point Mooring (SPM) with large internal diameter for 24 hour offloading. The final connection between the SPM and the shuttle tanker is made by floating hoses. Currently the flexible off-loading lines (OOL) are designed with steel wire armor, as typically used in the Offshore West Africa Fields. With pipes reaching 23" internal diameter and up to 2300m in length, the steel wires give the pipes a substantial weight generating the need for a large number of buoyancy modules to minimize the tension at the FPSO and OLT. These modules significantly add to both the cost and the installation time. Carbon Fiber Composite (CFC) is characterized by its light weight and exceptional fatigue performance, with the ability to be manufactured as an armor wire in a long continuous single length (more than 4000 meters). It can be used as an alternative to steel wire armors to design an optimized flexible pipe structure with significant advantages: â€¢ 45% decrease in submerged weight â€¢ Potential to install in double catenary configuration, without leading to excessive top tension â€¢ Buoyancy Modules are no longer required - installation is safer and quicker â€¢ Riser configuration is no longer impacted by fluid density These advantages allow greater flexibility in the position of the FPSO relative to the SPM with a fixed length of riser. Because CFC Armor is not susceptible to corrosion, service life of the flexible pipe is unaffected by breaching of the outer sheath and subsequent flooding of the annulus. This new design of flexible pipe, together with the installation and operational configurations, will be presented in this paper. In order to demonstrate the suitability of CFC, the material performance testing in severe fatigue and ageing conditions will be disclosed. The economic viability will be demonstrated by showing how the material cost is offset by the elimination of buoyancy modules and faster installation. Additionally this technology enables flexible OOL risers to be produced in a long single length. Copyright 2014, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Low impact and fuel efficient fishing-Looking beyond the horizon
AB  - Fishing provides high quality seafood and creates employment and income for people worldwide. Most of the capture methods used for fishing are, however, heavily dependent on the use of fossil fuels. For many important fisheries their high consumption of fuel constitutes a major constraint to their economic viability but also represents a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, fishing activities can sometimes impact the marine environments through excessive removals of ecologically and economically valuable species and also by direct physical contact with critical habitats. Fishing practices and gears vary widely in their environmental impacts and fuel efficiency but, in general, the impacts of passive fishing gears such as pots, traps, and hooks are considered to be less severe, and the amounts of fuel required per kg of catch smaller, than for towed gears such as beam trawls, dredges and the many types of bottom trawls. Through technological improvements and behavioral changes, the fishing sector can substantially decrease the damage to aquatic ecosystems, reduce emissions and lower its fuel costs. Changes in fishing practices can result in more economical and sustainable fisheries thereby contributing to improved food security. Barriers to begin transition to the use of low-impact, less fuel-intensive practices and gears include a perception that cost-efficient and practical alternatives are not available; restricted access to capital; ineffective technology infrastructure support; and inflexible fisheries management systems that restrict the rapid development and uptake of alternative gears. This paper discusses some of the key capture technologies and identifies gaps, constraints, and opportunities that facilitate the development and adoption of Low Impact and Fuel Efficient (LIFE) Fishing. LIFE fishing addresses the complex dynamic of energy consumption and environmental impacts with the objective of improving the economic viability and environmental sustainability of fishing operations.

TI  - Effects of elevated carbon dioxide on environmental microbes and its mechanisms: A review
AB  - Before the industrial revolution, the atmospheric CO2 concentration was 180-330 ppm; however, fossil-fuel combustion and forest destruction have led to increased atmospheric CO2 concentration. CO2 capture and storage is regarded as a promising strategy to prevent globalwarming and ocean acidification and to alleviate elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration, but the leakage of CO2 from storage system can lead to rapid acidification of the surrounding circumstance, whichmight cause negative influence on environmentalmicrobes. The effects of elevated CO2 on microbes have been reported extensively, but the review regarding CO2 affecting different environmental microorganisms has never been done previously. Also, the mechanisms of CO2 affecting environmental microorganisms are usually contributed to the change of pH values, while the direct influences of CO2 on microorganisms were often neglected. This paper aimed to provide a systematic review of elevated CO2 affecting environmental microbes and its mechanisms. Firstly, the influences of elevated CO2 and potential leakage of CO2 from storage sites on community structures and diversity of different surrounding environmentalmicrobeswere assessed and compared. Secondly, the adverse impacts of CO2 on microbial growth, cellmorphology andmembranes, bacterial spores, andmicrobial metabolismwere introduced. Then, based on biochemical principles and knowledge ofmicrobiology and molecular biology, the fundamentalmechanisms of the influences of carbon dioxide on environmental microbes were discussed from the aspects of enzyme activity, electron generation and transfer, and key gene and protein expressions. Finally, key questions relevant to the environmental effect of CO2 that need to be answered in the future were addressed. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - New Solutions to Geotechnical Challenges for Coastal Cities
AB  - Coastal cities like Singapore and Jakarta have undergone rapid economic development in the past decades. There is an increasing demand for infrastructure upgrading. With climate changes and population increase, geotechnical design and construction are getting more and more challenging for coastal cities. We need to develop new technologies and new solutions to tackle the challenges and enhance our ability to fight disasters such as earthquake and flood. In this paper, four different solutions pertinent to geotechnical engineering for coastal cities are presented. The first is the establishment of a web-based 3D geological map to make better use of geological and geotechnical data and information for more reliable geotechnical design. The second is a new method for using dredged slurry or soft materials for land reclamation, as there is a shortage of granular fill materials in many cities. The third is the technology for construction of seawalls using suction caissons. The last solution is the biogas desaturation method for mitigation of soil liquefaction which is becoming the most cost-effective solution for prevention of liquefaction for a large area.

TI  - Escalating the small-sized community green spaces' role as the carbon storage in the coastal town
AB  - The community green space type is well-known as a public place with a superior aesthetic value. In contrast, this green space type can also have the principal ecological value because of the vegetation cover. This study was estimated the above-ground biomass and carbon stock of each tree species within the community green spaces in both coastal and terrestrial habitat to select some potential species to be more developed within both community green spaces in order to escalate the ecological value of the green spaces (carbon storage in a town area). All woody plants with a diameter at breast height (dbh) >= 20 cm were identified by the census method within three sampling plots in both Laman Brenda Park (Site 1) and Pamedan Ahmad Yani Park (Site 2). This study found that the tree community in Site 2 stores a higher carbon stock (15,433 kg/ha) than in Site 1 (1,744 kg/ha). The number of individual trees is the main driving factor of the amount of carbon stock on both sites. Some species from Lauraceae, Fabaceae, and Meliaceae that are incredibly tolerant of small mineral content soils, salinity, and lack of water content should be more developed in Site 1, specifically.

TI  - The role of photovoltaics in a sustainable European energy system under variable CO2 emissions targets, transmission capacities, and costs assumptions
AB  - PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30 is an open-source, hourly resolved, networked model of the European energy system that includes one node per country as well as electricity, heating, and transport sectors. The capacity and dispatch of generation and storage technologies in every country can be cost optimized under different CO2 emissions constraints. This paper presents an overview of the most relevant results previously obtained with the model, highlighting the influence of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation on them. For 95% CO2 emissions reduction, relative to 1990 level, PV generation supplies in average 33% of the electricity demand. Southern European countries install large PV capacities together with electric batteries, while northern countries install onshore and offshore wind capacities and use hydrogen storage and reinforced interconnections to deal with wind fluctuations. The strong daily generation profile of solar PV heavily impacts the dispatch time series of backup generation and storage technologies. The optimal PV and wind capacities are investigated for variable CO2 emissions, transmission interconnection among neighbouring countries, and cost assumptions. Â© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Influence of Ocean Acidification and Deep Water Upwelling on Oligotrophic Plankton Communities in the Subtropical North Atlantic: Insights from an In situ Mesocosm Study
AB  - Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) causes pronounced shifts in marine carbonate chemistry and a decrease in seawater pH. Increasing evidence indicates that these changes summarized by the term ocean acidification (OA) can significantly affect marine food webs and biogeochemical cycles. However, current scientific knowledge is largely based on laboratory experiments with single species and artificial boundary conditions, whereas studies of natural plankton communities are still relatively rare. Moreover, the few existing community-level studies were mostly conducted in rather eutrophic environments, while less attention has been paid to oligotrophic systems such as the subtropical ocean gyres. Here we report from a recent in situ mesocosm experiment off the coast of Gran Canaria in the eastern subtropical North Atlantic, where we investigated the influence of OA on the ecology and biogeochemistry of plankton communities in oligotrophic waters under close-to-natural conditions. This paper is the first in this Research Topic of Frontiers in Marine Biogeochemistry and provides (1) a detailed overview of the experimental design and important events during our mesocosm campaign, and (2) first insights into the ecological responses of plankton communities to simulated OA over the course of the 62-day experiment. One particular scientific objective of our mesocosm experiment was to investigate how OA impacts might differ between oligotrophic conditions and phases of high biological productivity, which regularly occur in response to upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water in the study region. Therefore, we specifically developed a deep water collection system that allowed us to obtain similar to 85 m(3) of seawater from similar to 650m depth. Thereby, we replaced 20\% of each mesocosm's volume with deep water and successfully simulated a deep water upwelling event that induced a pronounced plankton bloom. Our study revealed significant effects of OA on the entire food web, leading to a restructuring of plankton communities that emerged during the oligotrophic phase, and was further amplified during the bloom that developed in response to deep water addition. Such CO2-related shifts in plankton community composition could have consequences for ecosystem productivity, biomass transfer to higher trophic levels, and biogeochemical element cycling of oligotrophic ocean regions.

TI  - Small-Scale Solar-Powered Desalination Plants: A Sustainable Alternative Water-Energy Nexus to Obtain Water for Chile's Coastal Areas
AB  - The natural potential of Chile-solar energy and 8 km of coastline-make the implementation of small-scale reverse osmosis desalination plants (RODPs) in coastal areas energetically supported with photovoltaic systems (PVs) feasible. This work considers a survey of the plants in Chile. As a demonstration of a RODP, a technical/economic evaluation is carried out, analyzing four possible cases in which different energy configurations are proposed: electric grid, diesel generator, and photovoltaic systems, without or with batteries. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of these plants are presented. The results obtained indicate that there are 39 plants in operation, which produce an average permeate water flow of Qp 1715 m(3)d(-1). Solar Explorer, and Homer Pro software are used for a plant that generates 8 m(3)day(-1) of permeate water, resulting in the conclusion that Case 3 is the most economically viable, as it has a useful life of 20 years and will have an annual solar contribution of more than 65\%. The levelized cost of water production is 0.56 USDm(-3) (RODP/PV) and 0.02 USDkW(-1)h(-1) was obtained for the LCOE. Finally, this case contributes to the mitigation of climate change.

TI  - Spatial response of coastal marshes to increased atmospheric CO2
AB  - The elevation and extent of coastal marshes are dictated by the interplay between the rate of relative sea-level rise (RRSLR), surface accretion by inorganic sediment deposition, and organic soil production by plants. These accretion processes respond to changes in local and global forcings, such as sediment delivery to the coast, nutrient concentrations, and atmospheric CO2, but their relative importance for marsh resilience to increasing RRSLR remains unclear. In particular, marshes up-take atmospheric CO2 at high rates, thereby playing a major role in the global carbon cycle, but the morphologic expression of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, an imminent aspect of climate change, has not yet been isolated and quantified. Using the available observational literature and a spatially explicit ecomorphodynamic model, we explore marsh responses to increased atmospheric CO2, relative to changes in inorganic sediment availability and elevated nitrogen levels. We find that marsh vegetation response to foreseen elevated atmospheric CO2 is similar in magnitude to the response induced by a varying inorganic sediment concentration, and that it increases the threshold RRSLR initiating marsh submergence by up to 60% in the range of forcings explored. Furthermore, we find that marsh responses are inherently spatially dependent, and cannot be adequately captured through 0-dimensional representations of marsh dynamics. Our results imply that coastal marshes, and the major carbon sink they represent, are significantly more resilient to foreseen climatic changes than previously thought.

AB  - We investigate six different lithium-ion battery modeling approaches to highlight the importance of accurately representing batteries in decision tools. Advanced mixed-integer-linear battery models account for efficiencies as a function of the discharge power, power-limits as a function of the state-of-charge, along with degradation, which are usually not accounted for in power systems models. The revenue potential from offshore wind paired with battery systems is then examined using the more advanced representation where degradation is the sum of the capacity fades resulting from calendar- and cycle-aging. The impacts of variability of offshore wind output along with energy- and capacity-market prices are evaluated using publicly available data from 2010 to 2013 using NYISO as a test case. For 2013, results highlight that without accurate battery representations, models can overestimate battery revenues by up to 35%, resulting primarily from degradation-tied costs. Advanced dispatch algorithms that account for calendar- and cycle-aging of the battery can help operate the battery more efficiently. Locating the battery onshore yields higher revenues and with wider useable SOC windows, it is possible to monetize higher arbitrage opportunities, which can compensate for any additional degradation-tied costs. The added value of a MWh of energy storage varies from $2 to $4.5 per MWh of wind energy, which leads to a breakeven cost range of $50â€“115 per kWh for the battery systems. As such, energy- and capacity-market revenues were found to be insufficient in recovering the investment costs of current battery systems for the applications considered in this analysis.

TI  - Uncertainty in United States coastal wetland greenhouse gas inventorying
AB  - Coastal wetlands store carbon dioxide (CO2) and emit CO2 and methane (CH4) making them an important part of greenhouse gas (GHG) inventorying. In the contiguous United States (CONUS), a coastal wetland inventory was recently calculated by combining maps of wetland type and change with soil, biomass, and CH4 flux data from a literature review. We assess uncertainty in this developing carbon monitoring system to quantify confidence in the inventory process itself and to prioritize future research. We provide a value-added analysis by defining types and scales of uncertainty for assumptions, burial and emissions datasets, and wetland maps, simulating 10 000 iterations of a simplified version of the inventory, and performing a sensitivity analysis. Coastal wetlands were likely a source of net-CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emissions from 2006-2011. Although stable estuarine wetlands were likely a CO2e sink, this effect was counteracted by catastrophic soil losses in the Gulf Coast, and CH4 emissions from tidal freshwater wetlands. The direction and magnitude of total CONUS CO2e flux were most sensitive to uncertainty in emissions and burial data, and assumptions about how to calculate the inventory. Critical data uncertainties included CH4 emissions for stable freshwater wetlands and carbon burial rates for all coastal wetlands. Critical assumptions included the average depth of soil affected by erosion events, the method used to convert CH4 fluxes to CO2e, and the fraction of carbon lost to the atmosphere following an erosion event. The inventory was relatively insensitive to mapping uncertainties. Future versions could be improved by collecting additional data, especially the depth affected by loss events, and by better mapping salinity and inundation gradients relevant to key GHG fluxes.

TI  - Integrating Algae with Bioenergy Carbon Capture and Storage (ABECCS) Increases Sustainability
AB  - Bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has been proposed to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but concerns remain about competition for arable land and freshwater. The synergistic integration of algae production, which does not require arable land or freshwater, with BECCS (called ``ABECCS{''}) can reduce CO2 emissions without competing with agriculture. This study presents a technoeconomic and life-cycle assessment for colocating a 121-ha algae facility with a 2,680-ha eucalyptus forest for BECCS. The eucalyptus biomass fuels combined heat and power (CHP) generation with subsequent amine-based carbon capture and storage (CCS). A portion of the captured CO2 is used for growing algae and the remainder is sequestered. Biomass combustion supplies CO2, heat, and electricity, thus increasing the range of sites suitable for algae cultivation. Economic, energetic, and environmental impacts are considered. The system yields as much protein as soybeans while generating 61.5TJ of electricity and sequestering 29,600t of CO2 per year. More energy is generated than consumed and the freshwater footprint is roughly equal to that for soybeans. Financial break-even is achieved for product value combinations that include 1) algal biomass sold for \$1,400/t (fishmeal replacement) with a \$68/t carbon credit and 2) algal biomass sold for \$600/t (soymeal replacement) with a \$278/t carbon credit. Sensitivity analysis shows significant reductions to the cost of carbon sequestration are possible. The ABECCS system represents a unique technology for negative emissions without reducing protein production or increasing water demand, and should therefore be included in the suite of technologies being considered to address global sustainability. Plain Language Summary We evaluated the sustainability of integrating algae production with bioenergy CCS (called ABECCS). Our motivation is to devise an affordable system that removes CO2 from the atmosphere without negatively impacting food security. The International Panel on Climate Change suggested that in addition to zero-emissions systems (such as solar power or crops), negative-emissions systems are needed to mitigate global warming. Bioenergy CCS (BECCS) is a promising negative-emissions approach in which biomass is combusted to generate electricity in conjunction with CCS. However, on a scale relevant to mitigating global warming, the arable land and freshwater requirements for BECCS could be unviable and cause competition with food production. In the ABECCS system, soy cropland is replaced by eucalyptus forests used for BECCS that provides marine algae with CO2, heat, and electricity. The integrated 2,800-ha facility produces as much high-quality protein as soy without increasing freshwater demand, and generates 61.5 TJ of electricity while sequestering 29,600t of CO2 per year. The system is economically viable when receiving \$600/t of algae and \$278/t of CO2 sequestered. With favorable economic conditions, ABECCS could contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere in a sustainable way.

TI  - Diminishing Opportunities for Sustainability of Coastal Cities in the Anthropocene: A Review
AB  - The world is urbanizing most rapidly in tropical to sub-temperate areas and in coastal zones. Climate change along with other global change forcings will diminish the opportunities for sustainability of cities, especially in coastal areas in low-income countries. Climate forcings include global temperature and heatwave increases that are expanding the equatorial tropical belt, sea-level rise, an increase in the frequency of the most intense tropical cyclones, both increases and decreases in freshwater inputs to coastal zones, and increasingly severe extreme precipitation events, droughts, freshwater shortages, heat waves, and wildfires. Current climate impacts are already strongly influencing natural and human systems. Because of proximity to several key warming variables such as sea-level rise and increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves, coastal cities are a leading indicator of what may occur worldwide. Climate change alone will diminish the sustainability and resilience of coastal cities, especially in the tropical-subtropical belt, but combined with other global changes, this suite of forcings represents an existential threat, especially for coastal cities. Urbanization has coincided with orders of magnitude increases in per capita GDP, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn has led to unprecedented demand for natural resources and degradation of natural systems and more expensive infrastructure to sustain the flows of these resources. Most resources to fuel cities are extracted from ex-urban areas far away from their point of final use. The urban transition over the last 200Â years is a hallmark of the Anthropocene coinciding with large surges in use of energy, principally fossil fuels, population, consumption and economic growth, and environmental impacts such as natural system degradation and climate change. Fossil energy enabled and underwrote Anthropocene origins and fueled the dramatic expansion of modern urban systems. It will be difficult for renewable energy and other non-fossil energy sources to ramp up fast enough to fuel further urban growth and maintenance and reverse climate change all the while minimizing further environmental degradation. Given these trajectories, the future sustainability of cities and urbanization trends, especially in threatened areas like coastal zones in low-income countries in the tropical to sub-tropical belt, will likely diminish. Adaptation to climate change may be limited and challenging to implement, especially for low-income countries. Â© Copyright Â© 2021 Day, Gunn and Burger.

TI  - Effect of offshore structures on shoreline evolution, atlantic generating station
AB  - A distorted scale hydraulic model investigation was performed to determine the potential effect, if any, of a proposed offshore nuclear power plant on shoreline evolution. Model measurements of current patterns and breaking wave characteristics (height, depth and angle to shoreline) were used to calculate longshore transport rates in the potentially affected areas. It was concluded that the proposed construction would have a negligible effect on future shoreline evolution. Â© Copyright 1975.

TI  - A process modelling approach to the evaluation of ship machinery configuration alternatives of LNG carriers
AB  - The increasing seaborne transportation of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in the current volatile global market and energy supply environment puts a pressure on LNG vessels to be more efficient, environmentally friendly, and costeffective. Modern LNG carriers feature complex and tightly integrated machinery systems to convert the onboard primary energy sources to useful energy demands for propulsion, electricity and heat. Therefore, process modelling and simulation techniques combined with an integrated systems approach is required for the evaluation of different configuration alternatives of LNG carriers. In this paper, we used our in-house process modelling framework DNVGL COSSMOS to develop a generic model of an LNG carrier integrated machinery system encompassing various propulsion and energy recovery technologies. The resulting system model was then coupled with a generic operational profile description accounting for various operating modes and intended trading routes of the vessel. The integrated LNG carrier machinery process model was subsequently used for the evaluation of different technology alternatives and machinery configurations. Namely, the model was used to size the gas-fuel compression trains; assess the introduction and optimal size of an LNG reliquefaction plant; compare electric and mechanical propulsion technologies; and, assess the introduction of energy recovery technologies such as shaft generators and exhaust gas economizers. The model-based studies resulted in an improved insight of this complex integrated machinery arrangement, revealing important performance trade-offs and interrelations between the vessel's sub-systems. The results revealed high energy savings potential of 5% to 8% depending on the energy recovery options implemented, operating profile and trading route. At the same time fuel savings of about 6% were identified, improving the overall cost-effectiveness of the integrated system.

TI  - Slenderwell wellhead benefits and opportunities of selected 13â€ option
AB  - The benefits and opportunities of the 13â€ slenderwell wellhead are examined. A smaller diameter, lighter weight drilling riser and/or BOP stack, reduces the riser tension requirements, deck load requirements, deck space requirements and drilling fluid requirements allowing smaller and older generation drilling rigs to be used in deeper waters. Another benefit is the opportunity to install a drill through horizontal completion tree or drill through tubing spool prior to the installation of the BOP stack. This eliminates the need to retrieve and reinstall the BOP stack in order to install the tree after drilling operations are completed. Opportunities to batch set surface and intermediate casing strings offer even more savings on mult-well projects. The BOP can be moved from well to well to drill for and to run the intermediate casing strings. The drill through horizontal completion tree can then be installed and the BOP run and moved from well to well to batch set the production casing strings and completions. The 13â€ slenderwell wellhead also provides additional life of well costs savings by allowing well intervention and workovers to be accomplished with a slender riser system and a smaller, less expensive intervention rig. The synergy of this slender wellhead system with other technologies such as expandable casing and slenderwell completions will be examined. The technical challenges encountered and overcome in the design of the wellhead system will also be discussed. Â© 2003, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - DESIGN AND TESTING OF AUV DOCKING MODULES FOR A RENEWABLY POWERED OFFSHORE AUV SERVICING PLATFORM
AB  - Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) missions are limited in range and duration by the vehicle's battery capacity, and sensor payloads are limited by the processing power onboard which is also restricted by the vehicle's battery capacity. Furthermore, the power consumption of a vehicle's acoustic system limits the possibility of substantial data transmission, requiring the AUV be retrieved to download most data. The Platform for Expanding AUV exploRation to Longer ranges (PEARL), described in this paper, aims to extend the range and endurance of AUVs while reducing data latency and operating costs. PEARL is an integrated autonomous floating servicing station that utilizes renewable energy to simultaneously provide AUV battery recharging and data uplink via new generation high-bandwidth low-Earth orbit satellite constellations. This paper details the design and testing of two potential AUV docking modules of the PEARL system. The modules are uniquely located near the ocean surface, an energetic environment that presents a particular set of challenges for AUV docking. The results will be used to inform the design of a prototype system to be tested in an ocean setting.

TI  - EXPERIMENT-SCALE MULTI-VESSEL DYNAMIC POSITIONING SYSTEM FOR THE TWIN-LIFT DECOMMISSIONING OPERATION
AB  - In general, the lifetime of the offshore oil and gas platform is about 20-30 years, and a large number of oil and gas platforms is approaching the end of their service. So, how to decommission these oil and gas platforms safely and cleanly becomes an urgent problem for the oil and gas industry and related organizations. And the costs for decommissioning equipment and services are expected to be as low as possible. It is important to develop the innovative removal techniques to reduce the overall cost of decommissioning. In this paper, we propose a new concept to remove large and heavy structures with a single lift, utilizing three semi-submerged vessels. The main process of the twin-lift solution for decommissioning includes two semi-submerged vessels lifting the topside together, and then carrying the topside to the third semi-submerged vessel. This method is simple in principle and does not require the manufacture of new special vessels, only needs to make simple modifications to existing semi-submerged vessels. It requires high positioning accuracy especially under environmental disturbances to ensure the safety of transportation. To ensure efficiency and safety, we develop a dynamic positioning (DP) system and perform a wave tank test for such a twin-lift decommissioning solution. Some aspects of an experimental facility set-up for scaled model test with dynamic positioning system are described. It includes the topology of the experiment and details of the deck mating, DP and monitoring system.

TI  - Embedding Anomaly Detection Autoencoders for Wind Turbines
AB  - Machine Learning solutions for anomaly detection can be applied in the industry to extend the lifetime of components by promoting actuation in real-time, like optimising machinery parameters to mitigate faults. The development of these approaches usually takes place on Cloud platforms. Nevertheless, Cloud platforms interacting with the real-time control loop add extraneous and unpredictable delays due to service availability and possible communication issues. Thus, embedding anomaly detection solutions in monitoring and control systems is an alternative to enable the aforementioned interaction. In a previous work, we investigated a Deep Autoencoder solution based on vibration data to detect anomalies in Wind Turbines. The solution is currently in usage in a Cloud platform and achieved promising results, which motivated its embedding. This paper demonstrates the process of embedding the solution while maintaining the detection performance metrics. The proposed embedding process reduced the execution time of the preprocessing steps to 18.09\% of the original method while saving up to 54.59\% of energy on average. An automatic search for low-cost configurations, while evaluating the impact of preprocessing steps, resulted in adequate configurations, improving the original anomaly detection performance and reducing memory utilisation up to 5.5x.

TI  - Green Ports - Building a Shore Power Load Model for Simulation
AB  - With the ever-looming threat of global warming to all life forms, the world is putting effort to achieve carbon neutrality in order to avoid grave consequences to ecosystems worldwide. The maritime industry is part of the vectors able to influence significantly emissions of greenhouse gases. In fact, the maritime industry moves more than 80\% of the World trade by volume, which makes it a large and growing source of global greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. The Ships are also a source of pollution to the local communities living near the Ports due to their energy consumption when at berth. At the current date, the most common method to mitigate this problem is to provide the ships at berth electricity from shore side. This paper presents the project greenPORT, which aims to create an energy management system for a green energy Port. After a brief introduction, the state of the art and relevant standards related to shore power and green ports are discussed and then, a Port load curve model is presented. This load model, built through a statistical analysis of real data from the Port of Lisbon from the year of 2019, will form the backbone of a future green port management system.

TI  - Assessment of CO2 storage potential in reservoirs with residual gas using deep learning
AB  - CO2 injection into the underlying water leg of depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs is a desirable option for carbon storage as demonstrated by existing industrial-scale storage projects in these geologic environments. This study sheds light on the effect of residual methane on the CO2 storage efficiency as a screening criterion for selecting a water-bearing zone of a depleted gas reservoir to store CO2. Using compositional reservoir simulations, we have evaluated the impact of residual methane on the injectivity, operational pressure, and long-term CO2 trapping efficiency during injection and postinjection stage in a reservoir model representative of the so-called ``HC sand{''} gas reservoir in the High Island 24L field located in the offshore Texas State Waters. Results suggest that the presence of residual hydrocarbon gas negatively affects CO2 residual and dissolution trapping because it enhances the injectivity and pressure management arising from the increased mobility of CO2 plume in the vicinity of the injection zone due to its mixing with the resident residual hydrocarbon gas. We further investigate the application of artificial neural network (ANN)-based proxy models for fast-track modeling of CO2 storage in geologic structures associated with depleted gas reservoirs, aiming at the prediction of CO2 trapping efficiency. We then use the developed ANN model to perform Monte Carlo simulations for quantifying the uncertainty of geologic and reservoir parameters on CO2 trapping efficiency in these formations. It becomes evident that the residual hydrocarbon saturation is a key screening criterion for the storage site selection. The developed data-driven model can offer a robust and fast tool for screening the water-bearing zone of the depleted gas reservoirs by evaluating the efficiency of CO2 storage.

TI  - Microbial ecosystem responses to alkalinity enhancement in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre
AB  - In addition to reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, actively removing CO2 from the atmosphere is widely considered necessary to keep global warming well below 2 degrees C. Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) describes a suite of such CO2 removal processes that all involve enhancing the bu ering capacity of seawater. In theory, OAE both stores carbon and o sets ocean acidification. In practice, the response of the marine biogeochemical system to OAE must be demonstrably negligible, or at least manageable, before it can be deployed at scale. We tested the OAE response of two natural seawater mixed layer microbial communities in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, one at the Western gyre boundary, and one in the middle of the gyre. We conducted 4-day microcosm incubation experiments at sea, spiked with three increasing amounts of alkaline sodium salts and a C-13-bicarbonate tracer at constant pCO(2). We then measured a suite of dissolved and particulate parameters to constrain the chemical and biological response to these additions. Microbial communities demonstrated occasionally measurable, but mostly negligible, responses to alkalinity enhancement. Neither site showed a significant increase in biologically produced CaCO3, even at extreme alkalinity loadings of +2,000 mu mol kg(-1). At the gyre boundary, alkalinity enhancement did not significantly impact net primary production rates. In contrast, net primary production in the central gyre decreased by similar to 30\% in response to alkalinity enhancement. The central gyre incubations demonstrated a shift toward smaller particle size classes, suggesting that OAE may impact community composition and/or aggregation/disaggregation processes. In terms of chemical e ects, we identify equilibration of seawater pCO(2), inorganic CaCO3 precipitation, and immediate e ects during mixing of alkaline solutions with seawater, as important considerations for developing experimental OAE methodologies, and for practical OAE deployment. These initial results underscore the importance of performing more studies of OAE in diverse marine environments, and the need to investigate the coupling between OAE, inorganic processes, and microbial community composition.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF ALTERNATIVE MARINE FUELS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL, TECHNICAL, AND ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES ONBOARD ULTRA LARGE CONTAINER SHIP
AB  - Ship emissions reduction targets are pushing the maritime industry towards more sustainable and cleaner energy solutions. Marine fuels play a major role in this because of the emissions resulting from the combustion process associated with the prime mover(s), therefore, one of the technical solutions is to replace conventional marine fuels with cleaner fuels. Hence the aim of this study is to undertake environmental, technical, and economic analysis of alternative fuels to reduce the environmental footprint and lifetime costs of the long-distance shipping sector. As a case study, an ultra large container ship operating on the East-West trade route has been considered, and the analysis focused on natural gas and methanol as alternative fuels. This study adopted three approaches: environmental, technical, and economic methods to compare the alternative fuels with the conventional ones. The results showed that a dual-fuel engine operated by natural gas will reduce CO2, SOx, and NOx emissions by 28\%, 98\% and 85\%, respectively, when compared with emission values for a diesel-powered engine. Furthermore, the reduction percentages reach 7\%, 95\% and 80\% when using a dual-fuel engine operated by methanol, respectively. The proposed dual-fuel engines will improve the ship energy efficiency index by 26\% and 7\%, respectively. The study shows that methanol is the most economical alternative fuel for this container ship, replacing diesel with methanol, leads to a power system that is only 30\% more expensive than the existing one. The analysis confirms that the cost of fuel has a major effect on the ship's life cycle cost and that by reducing the fuel costs, the costs of the power system become more acceptable.

TI  - SYSTEM SIMULATION-BASED FEASIBILITY AND PERFORMANCE STUDY OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL CONCEPTS FOR AQUACULTURE WELLBOATS
AB  - Climate change and population growth are increasing the need for sustainable food production. The ocean covers around 70\% of the earth's surface area and there is a great potential in utilizing this for ocean farming. However, the maritime traffic needs to decrease the emissions per transported mass with 50\% by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement. With an increased ocean space utilization, the vessel fleet will increase due to operational demands. Hence, with increased energy consumption, the need for decarbonization will increase further. Wellboats are one of the main contributors to the CO2-emission related to traditional fish farming production of Atlantic Salmon, not counting the actual feed production. Within the wellboat the fuel system has the highest potential to reduce the carbon footprint. However, one of the major challenges with the renewable fuels are their low energy density compared to fossil fuels. New, promising energy concepts have emerged, but they lack a quantifiable performance evaluation within the complete aquaculture supply chain. Further, the choice of the vessel's engine, generator and consumer modules affect each other. For example, changing to a fuel with lower energy density may lead to a larger fuel storage tank which then limits the available space for the fish tank. The main objective of this study is to use graphical system simulation to model and evaluate the performance of new concepts for low- and zero- carbon fuels. Based on these simulations, new fuel concepts can be compared with conventional marine diesel systems. The simulation model can be used to detect operational limitations with respect to range, transported mass (fish), vessel size, weight, and refueling possibilities. Further, it can also be used to identify bottlenecks in terms of size, weight, and voyage limitations. Based on the outcome of the wellboat system simulation model, the feasibility of fuel systems can be evaluated and used as recommendation for the design of new wellboats. The industry needs feasible solutions which are sustainable in terms of reliability and cost. The insights gained from using the simulation model aim to assist the industry to reach their emissions reduction goals by 2030, and to provide decision support for retrofitting the fuel and energy system of wellboats.

TI  - METHOD TO REACH HIGH SUBSTITUTION OF AN AMMONIA FUELED ENGINE USING DUAL FUEL RCCI AND ACTIVE COMBUSTION CONTROL
AB  - The International Marine Organization (IMO) has a goal of reaching 40\% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030 and target of a full 50\% reduction in marine fleet wide GHG emissions by 2050, while other organizations and governments desire to develop a path to Net-Zero GHG emissions by no later than 2050. To accomplish this, engines with near zero GHG emissions must be developed now. In addition to new ships, there is a large existing fleet of diesel fueled engines in the market today which are candidates for retrofit. Ammonia fueling of a diesel engine using dual-fuel combustion represents a viable zero- carbon fuel and combustion strategy suitable for long-haul / heavy-duty transportation due to its favorable storage properties of liquid at low tank pressure. The challenge, however, is ammonia is hard to ignite, slow to burn, and cool when it does burn which creates a significant challenge from a combustion point of view. Conventional dual fuel (CDF) will not be able to burn more than 50\% NH3-Diesel ratios efficiently with acceptable combustion quality, thus, combustion enhancement is required to get ammonia to ignite and burn at higher substitution rates. Woodward has developed a fueling and combustion control strategy using diesel pilot injection as the ignition source and combustion accelerant. And using RCCI combustion (Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition) controlled by Active Combustion Control (ACC) high ammonia-diesel substitution ratios (GSR) is demonstrated to burn as fast or faster than the baseline diesel. With the proportional reduction of carbon in the fuel and an appropriate ammonia slip catalytic technology, it is demonstrated that ammonia can be used as a GHG reduction fuel in dual-fuel diesel engines which can contribute to reduction in GHG emissions proportional to the NH3 substitution ratio. This is a technology which can be deployed today on both retrofit of existing engines as well as on new engines to meet the marine fleet average GHG emissions goals.

TI  - MOSES PROJECT: ENHANCING SHORT SEA SHIPPING WITH AUTOMATED TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - The MOSES Project (AutoMated Vessels and Supply Chain Optimisation for Sustainable Short SEa Shipping) aims to enhance the short sea shipping (SSS) component of the European supply chain. The MOSES project aims to create sustainable SSS feeder services to small ports with an expected 10\% modal shift to SSS in designated areas. To attain this target, MOSES proposes a combination of automated/autonomous technologies and supply and demand matching optimisation, like its AutoDock system for containerships in large terminals, which consists of the MOSES Autonomous Tugboat Swarm, supported by MOSES Shore Tugboat Control Station, and the automated docking scheme. Loading times for feeder vessels in large and small ports are expected to decrease by 20\% from the operation of MOSES Robotic Container Handling System outfitted on MOSES Innovative Feeder. Supply chain optimisation aims at increasing the attractiveness of SSS. The Innovative Feeder will be designed for a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of more than 90\%. The MOSES solution expects to attract stakeholders to SSS for a more sustainable EU container supply chain from the environmental, cost, and societal perspectives.

TI  - Hormone Application for Artificial Breeding Towards Sustainable Aquaculture-A Review
AB  - Aquaculture has been the fastest-growing area of worldwide food production and is becoming a vital component of the global economy to feed the rising world population. Hence, directed toward continuing the current level of per head consumption, comprehensive aquaculture production needs to attain eighty million tonnes by 2050. However, some cultured marine fish species, such as salmonids, striped bass, and gilthead seabream, as well as freshwater fish, such as captive Mediterranean amberjack populations (Seriola dumerili) and Mekong River giant catfish (Pangasianodon gigas), exhibit reproductive dysfunction, especially in female brood stock when reared in captivity. Captive females face complications with unsynchronised ovulation, fail to undergo final oocyte maturation (FOM), and no longer spawn due to a lack of luteinising hormone (LH). Thus, artificial breeding has been widely used in aquaculture practices to increase cultured fish production. Farmer has extensively applied commercial hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), Ovaprim, Ovatide, and Ovaplant, through injection and implantation of hormones to stimulate breeding in many farmed fish species. However, artificial breeding is still in its development phase, and some methods are still unable to induce spawning in certain fish species. Different methods, doses, and delivery systems of artificial hormones could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of artificial breeding. This paper discusses the current research on artificial breeding in various fish species as well as new approaches or techniques to be applied in the area to regulate the reproductive process in captive fish for sustainable aquaculture.

TI  - Toward a harmonization of sustainability criteria for alternative marine fuels
AB  - The discussion around shipping decarbonization has accelerated rapidly in 2020 and 2021. The growing studies on alternative marine fuels based on different criteria are indicative of both the complexities involved in marine fuels evaluation and absence of a consistent framework for assessment of alternative marine fuels from a holistic perspective. There is a recent call for an integrated evaluation model for alternative marine fuels with respect to economic, environ-mental, and social criteria. In this study, we develop and present a comprehensive and integrated set of sustainability criteria that are relevant for evaluating alternative marine fuels. First, we provide an overview of different alternative marine fuel pathways and assess the current chal-lenges associated with adopting alternative marine fuels. Second, we develop 18 sustainability criteria, identified through the academic and trade literature and validated through a multi -stakeholder participatory approach (based on the input from 70 maritime experts), for a sys-tematic and consistent evaluation of marine fuels. Third, based on an in-depth survey, we eval-uate maritime stakeholder perspectives on the importance of sustainability criteria. And finally, we provide a discussion of key policy implications and areas for future studies. Our analysis re-veals the current degree of agreement amongst maritime stakeholders in the debate about the importance of multiple, and often conflicting, criteria for evaluating marine fuels; the top five most important criteria are regulatory compliance, life cycle GHG, fuel cost, air pollution, and occupational health and safety. The analysis also looks at the importance ranking of each criterion from the perspective of individual maritime stakeholder groups. These findings provide decision -makers with a platform to understand priorities and interests of maritime stakeholder groups for the choice of marine fuels.

TI  - Carbon Removal Using Coastal Blue Carbon Ecosystems Is Uncertain and Unreliable, With Questionable Climatic Cost-Effectiveness
AB  - Mangrove forests, seagrass meadows and tidal saltmarshes are vegetated coastal ecosystems that accumulate and store large quantities of carbon in their sediments. Many recent studies and reviews have favorably identified the potential for such coastal ``blue carbon{''} ecosystems to provide a natural climate solution in two ways: by conservation, reducing the greenhouse gas emissions arising from the loss and degradation of such habitats, and by restoration, to increase carbon dioxide drawdown and its long-term storage. The focus here is on the latter, assessing the feasibility of achieving quantified and secure carbon removal (negative emissions) through the restoration of coastal vegetation. Seven issues that affect the reliability of carbon accounting for this approach are considered: high variability in carbon burial rates; errors in determining carbon burial rates; lateral carbon transport; fluxes of methane and nitrous oxide; carbonate formation and dissolution; vulnerability to future climate change; and vulnerability to non-climatic factors. Information on restoration costs is also reviewed, with the conclusion that costs are highly uncertain, with lower-range estimates unrealistic for wider application. CO2 removal using coastal blue carbon restoration therefore has questionable cost-effectiveness when considered only as a climate mitigation action, either for carbon-offsetting or for inclusion in Nationally Determined Contributions. Many important issues relating to the measurement of carbon fluxes and storage have yet to be resolved, affecting certification and resulting in potential over-crediting. The restoration of coastal blue carbon ecosystems is nevertheless highly advantageous for climate adaptation, coastal protection, food provision and biodiversity conservation. Such action can therefore be societally justified in very many circumstances, based on the multiple benefits that such habitats provide at the local scale.

TI  - Optimum combination of diesel and concentrating solar in remote area power generation using supercritical CO2 turbines
AB  - Electrification of remote communities is a great challenge worldwide. Their reliance on economically and environmentally unfavourable diesel generators makes these communities attractive target markets for renew-ables. Concentrating solar thermal (CST) plants operating on supercritical CO2 (s-CO2) Brayton power cycles have been proposed for their high efficiency, compactness, compatibility with natural air-cooling, and capability of being built at a small size without significant efficiency penalties. Thermal energy storage (TES) technology can mitigate intermittency problems. This study aims to identify the optimal configuration of hybrid CST and diesel generation (DG) for different types of remote locations based on annual simulations involving key system design features including solar multiple, TES size, and CST size. One novelty in this study is the inclusion of actual weather information and load demand profiles for selected potential locations. Another is that a realistic economic model for s-CO2 power blocks for small to medium sizes, based on accurate cost data, is presented. More importantly, a realistic representation of the s-CO2 turbine, which includes isentropic efficiencies varying at off-design conditions, is used. This facilitates a study into the effects that the inclusion of realistic off-design turbine information has on the thermodynamic and techno-economic performances of the system. This is done by comparing the simulation results with results obtained using a conventional method that uses a constant turbine efficiency. This paper presents the optimal system configurations offering the lowest levelised cost of energy (LCOE) obtained using three-variable exhaustive search optimisation. The results show that the system is an economically favourable option and provides substantial environmental benefits.

TI  - Moving beyond agriculture and aquaculture to integrated sustainable food systems as part of a circular bioeconomy
AB  - The objective of this perspective paper is to present and discuss how systemic innovations can deliver a step change in the way food is produced in Europe. The production of healthy, safe and affordable food can contribute toward a just transition to net zero carbon (C) for Europe. A systemic and cross sectorial approach can contribute to climate mitigation by transfer of atmospheric CO(2 )to the terrestrial biosphere using low trophic species (LTS), including plants, seaweed and mussels (i.e. C sequestration) and increasing organic C stocks in soils and vegetation biomass (i.e. C storage). Innovative combinations of technologies applied to LTS, processed animal protein, new crops, and diversified and integrated production systems can link the high primary productivity rates of the marine environment to the C storage capability of the terrestrial food sector. Furthermore, the important roles of both private and public sector actors and better use of systemic approaches to further elucidate the multi-dimensional and multi-level interplays in complex food systems needs consideration. This can pave the way for linking and scaling up C-neutral marine and terrestrial food production systems into a future sustainable and circular bioeconomy. This systems-based approach can address some of the challenges associated with the current farming systems, as interdisciplinary research on aquaculture innovation can support the development of a resilient and sustainable food system. Examples of technologies provided include: a custom configured and digital user-oriented co-creation approach for Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), a WebGIS tool on soil C storage, innovative composting methods, advanced breeding methods, new machinery for low greenhouse gas diversified orchard farming, AI model systems to improve decision support systems in management of soil, vertical farming, and animal feeding.

TI  - Why blue carbon cannot truly offset fossil fuel emissions
AB  - Blue carbon will not solve climate change. The effect is too small; existing sediment carbon stock is a liability; and there is a timescale mismatch between ancient fossil fuel emissions and uptake by vegetation.

TI  - Research progress of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology based on the shipping industry
AB  - With the concept of peak carbon emission and carbon neutrality proposed in the 21st century, the shipping industry, which accounts for more carbon emissions, began to seek the transformation of clean ships. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has issued a series of regulations and measures in recent years requiring the completion of the shipping industry decarbonization by 2050. However, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is currently seen as an effective way to reduce CO2 emissions from the shipping industry in the absence of mature applications for clean fuels. This paper summarized the research progress of ship based carbon capture technology. The application maturity of different carbon capture technologies in the field of the shipping industry is analyzed and compared. The transport and storage methods of CO2 are also introduced. Based on the current research status, the challenges of carbon capture technology in the shipping industry and the prospects of future technology development are put forward.

TI  - A systematic overview, trends and global perspectives on blue carbon: A bibliometric study (2003-2021)
AB  - Blue carbon sequestration is a nature-based solution to environmental problems caused by climate change and has a significant positive impact on the planet and human well-being. This paper bibliometrically and system-atically analyzed 2,613 studies found in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) from 2003 to 2021 to explore the hotspots and trends of blue carbon research using the Bibliometrix package in R studio and VOS-viewer software. The results based on network co-occurrence analysis indicated that mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes were the major blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), and mangrove carbon sinks were the most popular central research area. Furthermore, phytoplankton and microalgae have essential roles in the marine carbon cycle and bioenergy utilization, as revealed by the high proportion of published literature, while the carbon transport mechanisms of seagrass and macroalgae was understudied. Thematic evolution analysis revealed that remote sensing was the most commonly used technology as an emerging research field for ecological monitoring and ecological investigation in blue carbon research in recent years. In addition, increasing carbon sinks by artificial approaches, fishery carbon sinks, and carbon sequestration by macroalgae have been potential hotspots for blue carbon research development. The findings from this study shed light on the trends of blue carbon in the past eighteen years, current research points in the field, and areas that need more research investment going forward.

TI  - Multi-objective optimisation of a carbon capture and sequestration supply chain under seismic risk constraints. A case study considering industrial emissions in Italy
AB  - Carbon capture and sequestration represents a key decarbonisation option, particularly for large-scale fossil based industry sectors (e.g. cement, steel, and oil refineries). Carbon capture and sequestration networks have nonetheless raised concerns regarding the possibility of leakages, especially in high seismic-risk regions. In this study, a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming modelling framework is developed to minimise the cost and the seismic risk associated with the deployment of a carbon capture and sequestration infrastructure in Italy. The most significant industrial carbon dioxide sources (23 cement plants, 7 refineries, and 2 steel mills) are included in the model. The optimisation variables comprise capture technologies, transport options (onshore vs. offshore pipelines), and the choice of onshore and offshore deep saline aquifers for sequestration. Three carbon dioxide emission reduction targets (20 \%, 50 \%, 80 \%) are considered to assess the optimal design configurations in terms of either cost or seismic risk. Results show that the seismic risk optimum determines an increase in total cost ranging between 10 \% (for an 80 \% reduction target) and 65 \% (for a 20 \% reduction target) with respect to the economic optimum. Considering only offshore sequestration leads to cost increase between 20 \% and 30 \% with respect to solutions accepting onshore sequestration, too. Conversely, cost optimal infrastructures have a seismic risk that is between 1.5 and 18 times higher than that of the safest chains.

TI  - A research blueprint: Plant trait responses to stress and effects on blue carbon storage potential
AB  - Wetland plants form blue carbon ecosystems, which are key for climate change mitigation yet threatened by multiple local and global stresses. The capacity of blue carbon ecosystems to store large amounts of carbon relies on ecological processes, many of them regulated by plant traits that are shaped by the stress that plants encounter.This manuscript provides a perspective to investigate the effects of stress on carbon storage and sequestration capacity of blue carbon ecosystems based on the plant traits.A first step was to identify the biochemical, physiological, morphological and growth and development traits involved in the processes controlling carbon storage and sequestration in blue carbon ecosystems.Second, the existing knowledge on the stress effects on blue carbon processes and ecosystems was evaluated.Finally, the application of the trait-based approach to understand and predict carbon dynamics in blue carbon ecosystems under different stresses' feedback was discussed.The conclusions provide key recommendations for a trait-based approach in which the trinomial local and global stresses, plant traits and blue carbon are embraced together to identify the feedbacks between them, along with specific attention to the plant traits across the seascape, the stress interactions and the need of plant trait standardization.

TI  - Towards green carbon capture and storage using waste concrete based seawater: A microfluidic analysis
AB  - Carbon capture and utilization technology is the research stream dedicated to mitigating the pressing effect of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). The present study investigates a potential environmentally conscious solvent to capture and utilize CO2 using waste concrete and seawater under reactor conditions. Although seawater's CO2 soubility is low due to salinity, waste concrete raises seawater's pH and alkalinity, acting as a feedstock for CO2 dissolution and offsetting the adverse effects of salinity. To evaluate the performance of the novel natural seawater-concrete solutions for CO2 capture, time-dependent pH changes of solutions exposed to CO2 were measured in a microchannel using fluorescence microscopy. The concentration of dissolved CO2 in the solution was derived from pH change, revealing a 4-fold increase in the total dissolved carbon from 0.034 to 0.13 M and a 57.54% increase in the CO2 dissolution coefficient from 530 to 835 Î¼m2/s in seawater upon concrete addition. Electrolysis further enhanced the CO2 capture capacity of the seawater-concrete solution by increasing the pH, enabling the solid precipitation of carbonate minerals. Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed that electrolysis-driven precipitates are mainly amorphous calcium carbonates, useful building blocks for seashells and coral reefs.

TI  - Unveiling the potential for artificial upwelling in algae derived carbon sink and nutrient mitigation
AB  - Mariculture algae may present a crucial part of ocean-based solutions for climate change, with the ability to sequester carbon and remove nutrients. However, the expansion of mariculture algae faces multiple challenges. Here, we measure the changes in algae derived carbon sinks and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal between 2010 and 2020 in Shandong Province, China. We further identify the key driving factors, namely area, algal species proportion, and yield, that influence the changes. The results show that algae derived carbon sinks and nutrient removal growth rates in Shandong Province have slowed significantly since 2014, mainly due to area limitations, laver-oriented species change, and unstable yields. Artificial upwelling (AU) has the potential to enhance the yield and subsequently offset the loss of carbon sinks and nutrient removal caused by negative driving factors. Scenario analysis indicates that a complete deployment of AU by 2030 will offset up to a 44.52 \% decrease in the mariculture algae area, or a 72.57 \% increase in the laver share of the algal species combination compared to 2020. Similar conclusions are reached regarding the role of AU in N and P removal. This study also identifies ancillary challenges such as low energy efficiency and high costs faced by applying AU.

TI  - Biogenic carbon pool production maintains the Southern Ocean carbon sink
AB  - Through biological activity, marine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is transformed into different types of biogenic carbon available for export to the ocean interior, includ-ing particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and particulate inorganic carbon (PIC). Each biogenic carbon pool has a different export efficiency that impacts the vertical ocean carbon gradient and drives natural air-sea carbon dioxide gas (CO2) exchange. In the Southern Ocean (SO), which presently accounts for -40\% of the anthropogenic ocean carbon sink, it is unclear how the production of each biogenic carbon pool contributes to the contemporary air-sea CO2 exchange. Based on 107 independent observations of the seasonal cycle from 63 biogeochemical profiling floats, we provide the basin-scale estimate of distinct biogenic carbon pool production. We find significant meridional variability with enhanced POC production in the subantarctic and polar Antarctic sectors and enhanced DOC production in the subtropical and sea-ice-dominated sectors. PIC production peaks between 47 \& DEG;S and 57 \& DEG;S near the ``great calcite belt.{''} Relative to an abiotic SO, organic carbon production enhances CO2 uptake by 2.80 \& PLUSMN; 0.28 Pg C y-1, while PIC production diminishes CO2 uptake by 0.27 \& PLUSMN; 0.21 Pg C y-1. Without organic carbon production, the SO would be a CO2 source to the atmosphere. Our findings emphasize the importance of DOC and PIC production, in addition to the well-recognized role of POC production, in shaping the influence of carbon export on air-sea CO2 exchange.

TI  - Experimental Study of CH4-CO2 Replacement in Gas Hydrates in the presence of nitrogen and graphene nanoplatelets
AB  - Vast methane hydrates found in seabeds dispersed throughout ocean sediments and permafrost areas are a potential source of revenue as they act as an energy source. The encapsulation of carbon dioxide into the spaces occupied by methane molecules also creates a storage solution for greenhouse gases. This replacement reaction has two purposes; the first is energy release in the form of CH4 gas and the second is CO2 storage. This article presents experimental results on the CH4-CO2 replacement process using a. laboratory scale reactor with pure water and nanoparticles. Furthermore, the addition of nitrogen, as well as the use of thermal stimulation was studied experimentally to assess the enhancement of the replacement reaction. Additives such as graphene and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were utilized in the methane hydrate formation to further enhance the rate of hydrate formation. The experimental measurements show that a gas mixture of 80 mol\%N2/20 mol\%CO2 yields a CH4 replacement efficiency of 17.04 \%, while 28.77 \% replacement efficiency was the highest CH4 replacement efficiency obtained using thermal stimulation with pressurized CO2. The highest amount of CO2 sequestrated was 57.03 \%. This was achieved via thermal stimulation with pressurized CO2. The lowest CO2 sequestrated was 10.57 \% with 90 mol\% CO2/10 mol\%N2. The results confirm the significant improvements in CH4 hydrate formation, CH4 replacement efficiency, and CO2 sequestration ratio using graphene and SDS solutions. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - GREENHOUSE GAS REMOVAL IN AUSTRALIAN CLIMATE LAW: A POSITIVE ROLE FOR NEGATIVE EMISSIONS
AB  - Australia's path to net zero emissions must include both emissions reduction and removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Australia's large landmass and expansive marine estates provide significant opportunities for implementing these negative emissions technologies ('NETs'). Significant further legal innovation will be needed to facilitate NETs crediting and adapt existing environmental, health and safety legislation to this large-scale challenge. As a starting point, this article surveys the current state of Australian law and identifies priority areas for developing a legal framework to facilitate responsible research and development of NETs in Australia. It shows that the enormous scale of greenhouse gas removal requires: a market for NETs credits administered to ensure the legitimacy of crediting practices; special arrangements to facilitate research and development; technology-specific law reform targeting the most promising technologies; and regulatory coordination to ensure that environmental and social risks are adequately managed.

TI  - Converting coastal silt into subgrade soil with biochar as reinforcing agent, CO2 adsorbent, and carbon sequestrating material
AB  - Large amounts of coastal silt produced annually is urgent to be treated with a feasible strategy. This study converted it into subgrade soil by cement solidification for resource utilization. Biochar was used as exogenous additive for enhancing compressive strength of the product, simultaneously achieving carbon sequestration. Three biochars derived from peanut shells (PSBC), cow dung (CDBC) and sewage sludge (SSBC) at 300 Â°C, 500 Â°C and 700 Â°C pyrolysis, were added into raw materials with 1%, 2% and 5%, respectively. All biochars significantly improved the compressive strength of the subgrade soil by 20â€“110%. Biochar catalyzed cement hydration reactions to produce more Ca(OH)2, CaCO3 and calcium silicate hydrates (Câ€“Sâ€“H gel). The catalytic capacity of different biochars followed the order of SSBC > PSBC > CDBC. Addition of 2% SSBC500 induced the greatest increase in 28 d-strength from only 1.0 MPaâ€“2.1 MPa, which was due to that 500 Â°C biochar had a suitable specific surface area and porosity. Biochar facilitated CO2 capture (absorption) during the hydration reactions at the initial 48 h with 55â€“70 mg gâˆ’1. The high alkalinity and water holding capacity of biochar contributed to the absorption of CO2; the high content of minerals in SSBC compared to CDBC and PSBC promoted chemical conversion of CO2 to carbonate. Besides, the biochar itself as carbon rich material was encapsulated in the subgrade soil, which can be regarded as a long-term carbon sequestration strategy. Carbon budget analysis demonstrated that converting one ton dry silt into subgrade soil with addition of 2% biochar could increase CO2 sequestration from 11 kg to 36â€“94 kg. This study proposes a novel strategy of using biochar to strengthen the subgrade soil simultaneously achieve long-term carbon sequestration. Â© 2023

TI  - Eastern Mediterranean Energy Geopolitics Revisited: Green Economy Instead of Conflict
AB  - Dramatic technological advances in renewable sources of energy and environmental concerns have set in motion a global energy transformation that is expected to have profound geopolitical consequences. For example, the Eastern Mediterranean has been recently affected very hard by the fallouts of the ongoing climate crisis. While frictions among the countries of Eastern Mediterranean about maritime zones and continental shelf delimitation related to sovereign claims and to some degree with ambitions of finding oil and gas have abounded in recent years, the impact of a climate crisis on the same countries has been in recent years extreme. The Mediterraneanâ€™s more than half-a-billion inhabitants seem to face highly interconnected climate risks. Reasons for concern include sea-level rise-related risks, land and marine biodiversity losses, risks related to drought, wildfire, alterations of water cycle, endangered food production, health risks in both urban and rural settlements from heat and altered disease vectors. Historically, all these have led to mass migration to the cities, crossing borders to other countries, civil wars, ethnic conflicts and tensions. Against this background, energy transition and fight against common existential threats such as climate change or climate crisis are emerging as more daunting challenges as geopolitical competition to secure control of fossil fuels or to assert sovereign claims in the Mediterranean Sea.

TI  - Design and dynamic numerical modeling of a hybrid reverse osmosis/adsorption-based distillation system driven by solar dish Stirling engine for enhanced performance and waste heat recovery
AB  - In light of green solutions to address the shortage of freshwater shortage, energy crisis, and climate change. Trigeneration renewable systems are recently efficient approaches that can offer multiple energy outputs, such as heat, electricity, and distilled water. This paper presents a new hybrid freshwater production system driven by renewable energy for enhanced performance and waste heat recovery. This hybrid system proposes the utilization of reverse osmosis, an adsorption distillation system, and a solar dish Stirling engine (RO-ADS/SDSE). The cooperative concept is based on the re-desalination of the brine of the RO unit using an adsorption desalination system driven by the heat rejected from the SDSE, while the RO system is driven by the electrical energy produced by the Stirling engine. A mathematical model conducted in MATLAB coupled with EES package is developed to investigate the performance of the proposed RO-ADS/SDSE with and without pressure recovery (PR) mode at different salinity concentrations varying from 30000 to 50000 ppm at a constant feed pressure of 80 bar. The investigation is conducted based on the meteorological data of Tianjin, China. The results showed significant superiority in the performance of the proposed RO-ADS/SDSE system, as the annual freshwater production rate of the RO-ADS/SDSE with PR increased by up to 3000 m3 compared to 1700 m3 for the standalone RO system at a feed salinity of 45000 ppm and feed pressure of 80 bar. On a daily basis, the hourly permeating flow rate of the RO-ADS/SDSE with PR increased from 2.30 m3/h to 2.60 m3/h, and the permeate salinity decreased from 190 to 120 ppm. While the daily electricity consumption decreased from 5.20 to 4.40 kWh/m3. In conclusion, the proposed RO-ADS/SDSE system with PR can be considered a promising approach in maximizing the performance of desalination systems.

TI  - Effects of meteorological and climatological factors on extremely high residual load and possible future changes
AB  - Under high variable renewable energy (VRE) penetration, the occurrence of low VRE production, such as dark doldrums (Dunkelflaute) and wind-solar drought, can threaten a secure and continuous energy supply owing to an imbalance between electricity demand and supply. In this study, historically reconstructed long-term VRE generation and electricity demand were used to investigate the relationship between extremely high residual load (demand minus VRE output) and weather/climate in Japan. The impact of changes in the VRE's installed capacity on this relationship was also investigated using three simple future target scenarios. The results showed that the increase in installed VRE capacity causes greater daily and weekly residual load variabilities and affects the seasonality of its peaks. To study the weather patterns associated with high residual load events, selforganizing maps were applied to atmospheric circulation fields derived from atmospheric reanalysis data. The high residual load was associated with enhanced cold surge-type weather patterns during winter at the current low VRE installation level. However, under future increased VRE penetration, the weather patterns leading to high residual load will change to cloudy-windless types typically caused by a southern coastal extratropical cyclone. There is also considerable interannual variability in the frequency of high residual load events, which changed significantly with increasing VRE capacity. It is crucial to incorporate the dependence of climatic conditions into designing power systems to maintain the stability of a power system under future conditions.

TI  - Boron-rich enhanced ambient CO2 capture and storage of boron-carbon-nitride hybrid nanotubes
AB  - Increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as the most challenging greenhouse gas is considered as a major cause of global warming and ocean acidification. Different strategies against anthropogenic emissions of CO2 have been applied to capture and reduce the CO2 effect on the atmosphere. To this end, we study the adsorption of CO2 on boron-rich structures of boron-carbon-nitride (BCN) hybrid nanotubes by the implementation of an ab initio approach based on density functional theory (DFT). Three different boron-rich BC2N, BC4N, and parallel BCN (p-BCN) nanotubes are investigated as hosts for the capture and sequestration of CO2. The analysis of calculations shows that the boron-rich BC4N nanotube adsorbs CO2 physically, while in the boron-rich BC2N and p-BCN nanotubes, both chemisorption and physisorption occurred. In the chemisorption process, a linear CO2 molecule is bent over, and a new bond is formed between oxygen and boron antisite (B-N) in boron-rich nanotubes due to electron back donation between CO2 and nanotubes as a result of orbital mixing of oxygen and boron atoms. Moreover, our findings show that the sensitivity factor (SF) and adsorption energy for boron-rich BC2N nanotubes are higher than those of other hybrid nanotubes and CO2 free energy at room temperature. Elaborating on the stability and recycling of host material challenges suggests that the boron-rich hybrid nanotubes could be a good candidate for capturing CO2 under ambient conditions.

TI  - Investment decisions on carbon capture utilization and storage retrofit of Chinese coal-fired power plants based on real option and source-sink matching models
AB  - Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) is the only technological option for decarbonizing existing coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) deeply, yet its current scale is far from the level required to meet global climate goals. How carbon price can facilitate CCUS decarbonization of CFPPs in China is a great concern. This study couples a CCUS source-sink matching optimization model covering onshore and offshore geological storages with a trinomial-tree real options model, by which the Chinese critical carbon prices for CCUS investment at different emission reduction potentials are quantified. The results show that when the carbon price reaches 100, 200, and 400 CNY/t, then 24, 28, and 314 GW of CFPPs will enable to invest in CCUS immediately, achieving cumulative 1.8, 2.1, and 24.3 GtCO2 emission reductions over their remaining lifetime. To meet the global warming 2 degrees C target constraint on China's power sector, the carbon price need to reach 370 CNY/t.

TI  - Investigation of a renewable energy based integrated system with carbon capturing for hydrogen, methane and other useful outputs
AB  - This study introduces the design of a solar and wind-based novel multigeneration system capable of storing thermal energy. The proposed system can simultaneously capture carbon dioxide from a steel production facility while producing electrical power, space heating, methane, hydrogen gas, and freshwater. As it is a well-known fact that steel production contributes substantially to global carbon dioxide emissions, the design of a cleaner system, which can reduce or eliminate these emissions, is badly needed. The offshore wind power generates hydrogen gas through polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis. After that, a portion of the hydrogen generated is reacted with the captured carbon dioxide to produce methane/natural gas. The system's hydrogen and methane production rates are 0.01835 kgs îˆ“ 1 and 0.03649 kgs îˆ“ 1, respectively. The electrical power generated by the system is primarily from wind turbines and the integration of a solar-based multi-stage Rankine cycle. The net electrical power generated by the system and the freshwater production rate are 3.28 MW and 1 kgs îˆ“ 1, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed system can produce 207.2 kW of space heating. Additionally, the pro-posed multigeneration system has the overall energy and exergy efficiencies of 43.14\% and 22.67\%, respectively.

TI  - Exploring the Carbon Abatement Strategies in Shipping Using System Dynamics Approach
AB  - Amid growing global concerns about climate change and its environmental impact, the maritime sector is under increasing pressure to reduce carbon emissions. This study presents a system dynamics model that predicts and simulates vessel carbon emissions, considering different scenarios such as the implementation of carbon levies and the use of alternative marine fuels. The research focuses on the Pacific route, a key international container route, as a practical case study to simulate ship emissions along the Shanghai-Los Angeles container route under various emission reduction measures. Through a comparative analysis of different policy combinations, the findings demonstrate the effectiveness of carbon taxation and the adoption of diverse fuels in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from ships. Furthermore, the combination of these policies proves to be more effective in reducing emissions than implementing them individually. These results provide valuable insights for policymakers, industry professionals, and researchers working towards achieving low-carbon transitions in the shipping sector.

TI  - Current application of seaweed waste for composting and biochar: A review
AB  - To address the origins of ocean acidification, seaweed aquaculture is emerging as a key biosequestration strategy. Nevertheless, seaweed biomass is involved in developing food and animal feed, whereas seaweed waste from commercial hydrocolloid extraction is dumped in landfills, which together limit the carbon cycle and carbon sequestration. This work sought to evaluate the production, properties, and applications of seaweed compost and biochar to strengthen the ``carbon sink{'' implications of aquaculture sectors. Due to their unique characteristics, the production of seaweed-derived biochar and compost, as well as their existing applications, are distinct when compared to terrestrial biomass. This paper outlines the benefits of composting and biochar production as well as proposes ideas and perspectives to overcome technical shortcomings. If properly synchronized, progression in the aquaculture sector, composting, and biochar production, potentially promote various Sustainable Development Goals.

TI  - China's CO2 pipeline development strategy under carbon neutrality
AB  - Under China's goal of carbon neutrality, there is a huge demand for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, utilization, and storage technology (CCUS). CO2 transport, as a crucial link in the CCUS industrial chain, will inevitably rely on the construction of long-distance CO2 pipelines and infrastructure. Due to the late start and small scale of China's CO2 pipeline construction, and the relative lag in related technologies and policies, it is urgent to make systematical planning and achieve relevant technological breakthroughs for the future construction of CO2 pipeline network as a public infrastructure. Therefore, a three-stage pipeline development path is proposed based on the analysis of the spatial distribution characteristics and the temporal pattern of large-scale commercial development of CO2 carbon sources and storage in China. Moreover, solutions and suggestions are proposed upon the developments analysis in China from the perspectives of pipeline transportation technology, safety evaluation, materials and equipment, and integrity. The results show that the construction of CO2 pipeline network as an important CCUS infrastructure will accelerate with the development of the global CCUS industry; the spatial distribution of CO2 emission sources and storage is unbalanced in China, with 65.8\% from the eastern and central China, and CO2 flooding and geological storage contributing to most of large-scale CO2 pipeline transportation. The conclusions are as follows. First, the three-stage development path is a million-ton demonstration project of supercritical CO2 transmission pipeline before China peaks carbon emissions. After the achievement of carbon peak, a 10 million-ton regional network architecture of CO2 pipeline network centered on basins will be built, and trunk pipelines between regions will be formed before achieving carbon neutrality, establishing the national carbon transmission network with a transportation capacity of 10 x 108 ton, and a total mileage of approximately 6 x 104 km. Second, we should carry out research on the technology and equipment for the full phase CO2 pipeline transportation onshore and offshore, improve the domestic pipeline transportation technology, and promote the continuous improvement of the regulatory system in the pipeline transportation industry, so as to facilitate the implementation of demonstration projects.(c) 2023 Sichuan Petroleum Administration.

TI  - The role of PFAS in unsettling ocean carbon sequestration
AB  - Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and global climate change have attracted worldwide attention. PFAS have been found all across the planet, from the polar regions to the global ocean. Global oceans have emerged as a substantial sink for the carbon in the environment due to their remarkable capacity to absorb atmospheric carbon. Oceans absorb around 24% of the worldâ€™s CO2 emissions. Thus, the ocean plays a prominent role in the earthâ€™s carbon cycle. However, the widespread application of PFAS in a wide range of products and the inefficient management of PFAS-containing wastes made them ubiquitous pollutants, which are increasingly getting as a pollutant of emerging concern. Marine PFAS pollutants can produce harmful effects on gas exchange and the oceanâ€™s carbon cycle. Thus, it leads to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, which eventually adversely affects global warming and climate change. Consequently, threats of marine PFAS to oceans carbon sequestration are discussed in this paper. Marine PFAS pollutants adversely affect the following sectors: (1) The growth and photosynthesis of phytoplankton, (2) development and reproduction of zooplankton by causing toxicity in zooplankton, (3) marine biological pomp, and (4) carbon stock of oceans. In this way, marine PFAS can pose a threat to ocean carbon sequestration. It is expected that this study can develop knowledge about the potential impact of PFAS on ocean carbon sequestration. However, the need for further research to investigate the hidden dimensions of this issue, including the potential scope and scale of this impact, should not be overlooked.

TI  - Unlocking high carbonation efficiency: Direct CO2 mineralization with fly ash and seawater
AB  - Direct CO2 mineralization using fly ash is a promising technology to achieve CO2 sequestration. Seawater's abundance and calcium-rich composition make it an attractive substitute solution for CO2 sequestration. However, there have been limited studies conducted so far, and the mineralization mechanism remains unclear, which has constrained its industrial application potential. Here we utilized low CaO-content fly ash in combination with seawater to perform direct CO2 mineralization under ambient conditions, achieving a remarkable carbonation efficiency of 94.8 \%. Upon scrutinizing the carbonate parameter evolution, we identify a crucial pH range (8.2 similar to 10.4) that enhances calcium elution efficiency, leading to heightened carbonation efficiency. The involvement of Mg(OH)(2) within this pH range influences CaCO3 precipitation kinetics and crystalline phase. This innovative approach holds promise for carbon sequestration and presents a valuable contribution to sustainable CO2 utilization strategies.

TI  - Shoreface erosion counters blue carbon accumulation in transgressive barrier-island systems
AB  - Landward migration of coastal ecosystems in response to sea-level rise is altering coastal carbon dynamics. Although such landscapes rapidly accumulate soil carbon, barrier-island migration jeopardizes long-term storage through burial and exposure of organic-rich backbarrier deposits along the lower beach and shoreface. Here, we quantify the carbon flux associated with the seaside erosion of backbarrier lagoon and peat deposits along the Virginia Atlantic Coast. Barrier transgression leads to the release of approximately 26.1 Gg of organic carbon annually. Recent (1994-2017 C.E.) erosion rates exceed annual soil carbon accumulation rates (1984-2020) in adjacent backbarrier ecosystems by approximately 30\%. Additionally, shoreface erosion of thick lagoon sediments accounts for >80\% of total carbon losses, despite containing lower carbon densities than overlying salt marsh peat. Together, these results emphasize the impermanence of carbon stored in coastal environments and suggest that existing landscape-scale carbon budgets may overstate the magnitude of the coastal carbon sink.

TI  - Integrated biorefinery approach to valorise Saccharina latissima biomass: Combined sustainable processing to produce biologically active fucoxanthin, mannitol, fucoidans and alginates
AB  - The feasibility of European seaweed farming depends on the valorisation of algal biomass harvested. In the present work we have combined sequential extraction processes from Saccharina latissima to produce a range of products, focusing on the extraction of fucoxanthin using supercritical CO2 followed by different valorisation routes. We optimised the conditions the for extraction of fucoxanthin (40 MPa, temperature has little impact on extraction) and the extracts obtained were tested on cancer cell cultures to determine the antiproliferative effects of this pigment. We established that the supercritical CO2 extracts have an antiproliferative effect similar to that of commercial fucoxanthin (concentrations 0.1-0.4 mg/mL) and showed that the active compound in the extracts is fucoxanthin. In order to integrate this process with a holistic valorisation of the algal biomass, we explored the extraction of mannitol using a microwave-assisted protocol (4.15 wt \% yield). We also evaluated the potential extraction of fucoidans and alginates from the solids remaining after supercritical CO2 extraction (67.27 to 69.38 \% of alginates). A life cycle analysis of the supercritical CO2 extraction proposed shows that the drying process of algal biomass and the energy used to compress the CO2 are the elements with the highest environmental impact (over 90\% of CO2 eq/g of extract) in this the process, indicating routes for reducing the environmental footprint. Combining supercritical CO2 extraction and microwave-assisted extraction methods would enable European seaweed producers to obtain multiple marketable products from algal biomass.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - Unlocking the desalination processes future roadmap
AB  - Energy-water-environment nexus is very important to attain COP21 goal, maintaining environment temperature increase below 2?, but unfortunately two third share of CO2 emission has already been used and the remaining will be exhausted by 2050. A number of technological developments in power and desalination sectors improved their efficiencies to save energy and carbon emission but still they are operating far from their thermodynamic limits. The theoretical thermodynamics limit for seawater desalination at normal conditions is about 0.78 kWh/m(3) depending on the initial salt contents. However, practical plants are operated at several folds higher than this limit due mainly to inherent losses in the processes that were incurred in removing dissolved salts. Technological advancement in thermally driven processes hybridization have set the new bench mark for lowest energy consumption that has boosted the water production trend of desalination industry. In this paper, we presented multi-effect desalination (MED) hybridization with pressure swing adsorption (PSAD) cycle to overcome lower brine temperature limitations to boost overall performance of the system. The synergetic effect from hybridization of MED-PSAD permits a higher overall operational range and inter-stage temperature differences, leading to a boost in water production up to 2-3 folds. We showed that the proposed hybrid cycle can achieve highest performance SUPR = 20\% of thermodynamic limit: one of the highest performance reported in the literature up till now. These figures can be translated to less than US\$ 0.47/m(3) - a lowest specific cost ever reported in the literature. The proposed cycle is not only tested at pilot scale, but also successfully commercialized into industry and received many international awards as one of the most efficient and sustainable desalination technology.

TI  - Simultaneous transport of freshwater and heat: An application to Chinese northern coastal regions
AB  - Enormous, clean, stable and cheap freshwater and heat from renewable and sustainable energy systems are of utmost importance to avert consequences of climate change, especially in Chinese northern coastal regions. Simultaneous transport of freshwater and heat is a novel technology for integrated use of nuclear power in the form of hot freshwater production with the potential to overcome the drawbacks of desalination and cogeneration. In this paper we address the performance of next generation supply of freshwater and heat methods. Starting our experience with simultaneous transport of freshwater and heat at an AP1000 nuclear plant, we developed for the first time a validated actual demonstration project to know the thermodynamic performance. The model allows us to understand the crucial methods to improve transport capacity through analysis. Simultaneous transport of freshwater and heat pipeline's lifespan assessment algorithm is developed to compare proper methods to extend pipeline's lifespan economically. The relationship between cost in whole lifespan and key parameters like external diameter, wall thickness, transported distance, flow velocity, corrosion rate, innercoating's price and lifespan is investigated to obtain sensitivity analysis. We found that (a) simultaneous production of freshwater and heat improves thermal efficiency by 32.61 \%; (b) Thicker wall pipelines are low-cost and have stronger ability to resist economic risks and keep low-cost in whole lifespan. However, wall thickness shall be limited; (c) Thicker wall extends lifespan longer and makes cost less than inner coating. In summary, this work points out that freshwater and heat pipeline's transport capacity should be enlarged with consideration of integrated system to settle freshwater and heat's enormous demand and large-scale actual projects are needed. Once these technologies are promoted in China coastlines' thermal plants, Chinese northern areas will benefit from them.

TI  - Ocean acidification stunts molluscan growth at CO2 seeps
AB  - Ocean acidification can severely affect bivalve molluscs, especially their shell calcification. Assessing the fate of this vulnerable group in a rapidly acidifying ocean is therefore a pressing challenge. Volcanic CO2 seeps are natural ana-logues of future ocean conditions that offer unique insights into the scope of marine bivalves to cope with acidification. Here, we used a 2-month reciprocal transplantation of the coastal mussel Septifer bilocularis collected from reference and elevated pCO2 habitats to explore how they calcify and grow at CO2 seeps on the Pacific coast of Japan. We found significant decreases in condition index (an indication of tissue energy reserves) and shell growth of mussels liv-ing under elevated pCO2 conditions. These negative responses in their physiological performance under acidified con-ditions were closely associated with changes in their food sources (shown by changes to the soft tissue 813C and 815N ratios) and changes in their calcifying fluid carbonate chemistry (based on shell carbonate isotopic and elemental sig-natures). The reduced shell growth rate during the transplantation experiment was further supported by shell 813C re-cords along their incremental growth layers, as well as their smaller shell size despite being of comparable ontogenetic ages (5-7 years old, based on shell 818O records). Taken together, these findings demonstrate how ocean acidification at CO2 seeps affects mussel growth and reveal that lowered shell growth helps them survive stressful conditions.

TI  - Potential Use of Biomass Waste as a Sustainable Energy Source in the Future: A Case Study
AB  - - Mangroves have been degraded and converted for decades due to a multitude of factors, ranging from human activity to natural perturbations such as disasters and global warming. Experiments were conducted to determine the impact of fly ash (FA) on the growth of Rhizophora apiculata Blume's (R. apiculate). A completely randomised design (CRD) was employed with D as the control, and nine treatment soil amendments were created from abandoned shrimp pond sediment with rubberwood fly ash (RWFA). These amendments were made by mixing three separate FA samples (A, B, and C) in the ratios of 75:25, 50:50, and 25:75, respectively (A1-A3, B1-B3, and C1-C3), using a total of 200 R. apiculata specimens.The experiment revealed that the addition of FA and its combination had a significant effect on promoting the growth of R. apiculate and improved nutrient availability and retention in the soil. The results of the experiment demonstrate that the effect of Fly Ash (FA) and its combination significantly influence the growth of R. apiculate, impacting the total heights and number of leaves. The most beneficial effect the results of the experiment demonstrate that the effect of fly ash (FA) and its combination significantly influence the growth of R. apiculate, affecting the total height and number of leaves. The most beneficial effects were observed when the optimal proportion of each type of soil amendment was used. The study holds substantial benefits: it introduces a method for improving the soil of shrimp farms through the utilisation of rubberwood fly ash (RWFA) and serves essential nutrients to mangroves. Moreover, implementing this plantation technique can aid in protecting against coastal erosion.

TI  - Inventive Activity for Climate Change Mitigation: An Insight into the Maritime Industry
AB  - Climate change mitigation is one of the most important challenges facing the modern world. It is necessary to monitor the development of new concepts and technologies and take a stab at identifying disruptive innovations, which have the potential of becoming real climate-friendly game changers. The aim of this paper is to examine the patterns of inventive activity aimed at mitigating climate change in the maritime industry with respect to other transport modes. Appropriate research tools in the area of patent analysis were selected and utilised. A new class of patents related to climate change in maritime transport (CPC-Y02T70/00) was used as a data source. The original value of the study consists of offering a complete picture of the efforts made in patenting activity in climate change mitigation in the maritime transport, with a look at leading applicants and countries, knowledge flows, the most robustly developed and underdeveloped technical fields. A map of technical knowledge flows for climate change mitigation in transport was constructed. The research results show that inventions for the maritime industry are less hermetic than those for air and road transport; however, they are not as much linked with previously developed solutions. The most intensively developed technical fields include the design and construction of watercraft hulls (1) and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to the propulsion system (2). Among the technologies whose further development merits close attention are solutions related to electrical propulsion and wave energy. At the same time, inventive activity in the area of climate change adaptation dedicated to ports is insignificant and definitely needs more support from the community of scientists and inventors. Building knowledge based on patent information can help universities, research institutions, shipyards, manufacturers of marine equipment and other business entities to identify the technologies of the greatest potential for further development.

TI  - Application of microbial mineralization technology for marine concrete crack repair: A review
AB  - Microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) is an emerging biotechnology with a wide range of potential applications in structural repair. Compared to conventional concrete repair methods, MICP is economically feasible and sustainable. The restoration effects of MICP have been proved in the laboratory. However, due to the harsh marine environment, this technology has not been widely applied to marine concrete restoration yet. This paper mainly reviews the mineralization mechanisms of five common types of mineralizing bacteria and analyzes the effects of temperature, pH, and medium components on bacterial reproduction and calcium carbonate precipitation. Then, four strategies for concrete crack repair are introduced, and restoration effects are evaluated according to the strength and durability of repaired specimens. Next, the effects of marine environment and ions in seawater on the bacterial reproduction, yields of calcium carbonate, and crack restoration are explored. The potential adverse effects of the MICP process on the environment and reinforcement corrosion are discussed as well. Finally, the challenges and suggestions are put forward to promote the application of MICP in marine concrete restoration.

TI  - Preparation of Artificial Aggregates from Marine Dredged Material: CO2 Uptake and Performance Regulation
AB  - A continuous treatment process using steel slag powder including foam drying and carbonation processes (termed the SSFD-C method) is a novel technology previously developed in our laboratory. It has achieved the first application of carbonation solidification technology to recycle marine dredged material with high moisture content. The aim of this study is to investigate CO2 uptake and performance regulation in the preparation of carbonated eco-aggregates (CEAs) from dredged soils processed using the SSFD-C method. Steel slag and lime hydrate independently contribute to the strength of CEAs. However, the influence they exert on CO2 uptake, along with other properties, such as pH values and water absorption of CEAs, remains unclear. Furthermore, it is important to clarify whether the soluble silica in a CEA originates from dredged soil or steel slag, as a CEA has the potential to provide silica nutrients to plants. The findings indicated that within the initial three hours of carbonation, the strength of CEAs could approximate 65\% of the ultimate stable strength. The moisture absorption for CEAs was noted to be in the 26-30\% range. Carbonation over a 24 h period can lower the pH of the CEA to less than 10, and the carbonation reaction can penetrate the core of the 10-15 mm CEA pellets. Carbonation of the lime hydrate fraction was more favorable to increase the CO2 uptake of the CEA, and carbonation of the steel slag fraction was more favorable to decrease the pH value and water absorption of the CEA. The water-soluble silicon of the CEA was found to have been mainly derived from steel slag, while it was established that carbonation could increase the water-soluble silicon content of the CEA by 5-8 times. The result of this study could provide theoretical guidance for regulating the performance of CEAs.

TI  - Biofuels and Electrofuels as Alternative Green Fuels for Marine Applications: A Review
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has imposed strict regulations to limit marine emissions because the maritime sector is expanding around the world, producing large amounts of emissions that are harmful to the atmosphere. Green alternative fuels, such as biofuels derived from biomass and electrofuels derived from syngas sources, play critical roles in meeting IMO requirements for clean energy with zero emissions. This study presents a brief review of two types of green fuels: 1) the production of biofuels from biomass sources by using various methods, such as the gasification process and the pyrolysis process, as well as the effectiveness of adding a variety of catalysts, and 2) electrofuels as a new method to oppose global warming by employing various carbon capture strategies and renewable hydrogen production based on water electrolysis. Following that, the significant effect of using these green fuels in marine applications is discussed. Overall, the primary goal of this article is to provide data for researchers and industrialists interested in biofuels and electrofuels as promising alternatives to fossil fuels. A large portion of the existing literature published in highly regarded journals, including the most recently published reports, is analyzed.

TI  - Extreme rainstorms change organic matter compositions and regulate greenhouse gas production in mangrove sediments
AB  - Extreme rainstorms can flush intertidal sediments and drive the transport of large amounts of organic matter from land to sea. Mangrove wetlands, one of the most important ``blue carbon{''} habitats, are located in the intertidal zone and serve as an ecological corridor connecting land and sea. In this study, we investigated the effects of extreme rainstorms on organic carbon compositions, source-sink processes based on the MixSIAR model, and the production of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), using mangrove sediments. The results showed that in the intertidal zone, the total contents of sediment organic carbon, mineral-bound, and fine-particle organic carbon, humic acid, and humin were improved by the influence of an extreme rainstorm. The contents of coarse sediment organic carbon (SOCcoarse) and fulvic acid were decreased and were exported from intertidal zone to the sea. In tidal creek zones, extreme rainstorms enhanced the mean production rates of CH4 and CO2 by 817.4\% and 34.3\%, respectively, owing to the increased terrestrial organic matter, including SOCcoarse and humic acid. The N2O production rate was decreased by 72.2\% in the creek zone because of the loss of total nitrogen after an extreme rainstorm. These findings provide new insights into SOC components, mechanisms of greenhouse gas production, and their response to extreme rainstorms, which will be helpful for the management of coastal wetlands and our understanding of how frequent extreme weather controls wetland biogeochemical processes.

TI  - Blowdown of CO2 vessels at low and medium pressure conditions: Experiments and simulations
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) involves transportation of liquefied CO2 from capture sites to permanent storage locations, which is usually achieved by pipeline transportation or maritime shipping. Over long distances, maritime shipping at pressures around 16 bara has proved to be a more effective solution than transportation through pipelines. These conditions, although safe, offer a significant pressure margin with respect to the triple point of CO2 for more cost-effective ship design with larger transportation capacity. However, the reliability of this technology has not been fully demonstrated regarding depressurization operations commonly performed to minimize hazards associated to emergencies. For CO2, this operation entails risks such as dry ice formation. This paper focuses on two purposes. First, it reports detailed and extensive experimental tests of CO2 depressurization of a tanks at low pressure (< 20 bara). An extensive review of public domain literature showed that this data is scarce {[}20] This work focuses on contributing to close that gap. Finally, this work will present detailed simulations of the experiments using commercial flowsheeters to assess the reliability of standards models that are commonly used for engineering studies and design. All the experimental work was carried out using a bench scale tank of 2 m3 with ample instrumentation according to an experimental design. The results of the runs were modelled using the EO-Blowdown utility implemented in UniSim Design (R). The results showed that modelling of CO2 systems with the EO-Blowdown utility is reliable and can reproduce accurately most key process variables, although it has some limitations such inability to model solid phases and metastable liquids

TI  - REDUCTION OF CO2 EMISSIONS FROM OFFSHORE COMBINED CYCLE DIESEL ENGINE-STEAM TURBINE POWER PLANT POWERED BY ALTERNATIVE FUELS
AB  - Diverse forms of environmental pollution arise with the introduction of materials or energy that exert adverse effects on human health, climate patterns, ecosystems, and beyond. Rigorous emission regulations for gases resulting from fuel combustion are being enforced by the European Union and the International Maritime Organization (IMO), directed at maritime sectors to mitigate emissions of SOx, NOx, and CO2. The IMO envisions the realisation of its 2050 targets through a suite of strategies encompassing deliberate reductions in vessel speed, enhanced ship operations, improved propulsion systems, and a transition towards low and zero-emission fuels such as LNG, methanol, hydrogen, and ammonia. While the majority of vessels currently depend on heavy fuel or low-sulphur fuel oil, novel designs integrating alternative fuels are gaining prominence. Technologies like exhaust gas purification systems, LNG, and methanol are being embraced to achieve minimised emissions. This study introduces the concept of a high-power combined ship system, composed of a primary main engine, a diesel engine, and a steam turbine system, harnessing the energy contained within the flue gases of the main combustion engine. Assumptions, constraints for calculations, and a thermodynamic evaluation of the combined cycle are outlined. Additionally, the study scrutinises the utilisation of alternative fuels for ship propulsion and their potential to curtail exhaust emissions, with a specific focus on reducing CO2 output.
