TI  - The novel contribution of non-noble metal catalysts for intensified carbon dioxide hydrogenation: Recent challenges and opportunities
AB  - The enormous growth in anthropologic activities (carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions) and continuous depletion of non-renewable sources have contributed to the problem of climate change and ocean acidification. Hence, CO2 capture/utilization has been widely investigated as an alternative, eco-friendly, and sustainable energy approach. Catalytic CO2 hydrogenation has the potential to effectively produce value-added chemicals and alternative fuels, thus, alleviating global CO2 emissions and reducing harmful environmental impacts. This brief review is focusing on the potential contribution of novel heterogeneous catalysts for the synergic CO2 hydro-genation into carbon monoxide, methanol, and dimethyl ether (DME). Comprehensive/detailed discussions have been made on the enhanced catalytic performance of reverse water-gas shift (RWGS)reaction (similar to 850 degrees C) with emphasis on the preparation methods, catalytic supports, non-noble metallic catalysts, and synergistic reaction mechanisms. The role of the Cu-based catalytic system has been featured in enhanced reaction thermodynamics, kinetics, and mechanisms of CO2 hydrogenation. The potential applicability of bi-functional catalysts with advanced water sorbents (zeolites 3A) has been investigated for CO2 conversion to DME through the intensified sorption-enhanced process. Overall, the recent advancements in the area of structure-activity relationships in situ with characterization techniques, and combined experimental catalytic measurements exhibit improved CO2 conversion of 80\%, CO selectivity of 99\%, methanol selectivity of 100\%, and DME selectivity of 66\%. The future research interest is directed towards the operation of low-cost and highly efficient water sorbents (i.e., zeolite 13X) with methanol/DME synthesis at <250 degrees C. Furthermore, the synthesis of bifunctional mixtures of active catalytic phase with adsorbent can be investigated in the optimized hybrid reactors with renewable energy re-sources for improved CO2 hydrogenation.

TI  - Electric propulsion powered by hydrogen cells: Impact on carbon footprint mitigation
AB  - The increase in global temperature, as a result of greenhouse gas emissions, continues to be a major concern that has led to a deep interest in the implementation of hydrogen as a source of electric power generation; therefore, hydrogen fuel cell technologies have been developed and are available on the market to mitigate CO2 emissions generated by the use of fossil fuels. This document describes the methodology used for the design of an electric propulsion system with energy supply from a hydrogen fuel cell in a Light Cabotage and Logistic Support Vessel -BALC-L. The current design of the vessel has a conventional propulsion with two diesel engines of 224 bkW each and two diesel generators 99 ekW each, as the basis for the proposed analysis of an electric propulsion system energized through a hydrogen fuel cell system. As a result, a change in the operational profile of the vessel and a reduction in the CO2 emissions that it would generate throughout its useful life cycle are identified. The research described in this document is a starting point for the implementation of these technologies in the maritime and fluvial industry in Colombia.

TI  - How biotic, abiotic, and functional variables drive belowground soil carbon stocks along stress gradient in the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest?
AB  - Mangrove forests, some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems on Earth, play an important role in climate change mitigation through storing carbon in the soil. However, increasing anthropogenic pressures and sea level rise are likely to alter mangrove forest structure and functions, including the major source of carbon in mangrove ecosystems - below-ground soil carbon stocks (BSCS). Although estimating soil carbon stocks has been a popular practice in the mangroves, but poorly understood the (I) the linkage between BSCS and key ecosystem drivers (i. e., biotic, abiotic, and functional) and in (II) determining the pathways of how BSCS and multiple forest variables interact along stress gradients. This lack of understanding limits our ability to predict ecosystem carbon dynamics under future changes in climate. Here, we aimed to understand how abiotic factors (such as salinity, canopy gap fraction, nutrients, and soil pH), biotic factors (e.g., structural parameters, canopy packing, and leaf area index, LAI), and forest functional variables (e.g., growth and aboveground biomass stocks, AGB) affect BSCS (i.e., soil organic carbon, SOC, and root carbon, RC) using spatiotemporal data collected from the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest (SMF) in Bangladesh. We observed that BSCS decreased significantly with increasing salinity (e. g., from 70.6 Mg C ha-1 in the low-saline zone to 44.6 Mg C ha-1 in the high-saline zone). In contrast, the availability of several macronutrients (such as nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium), LAI, species diversity, AGB, and growth showed a significant positive effect on SOC and RC. Stand properties, including tree height, basal area, density, canopy packing, and structural diversity, had a non-significant but positive impact on RC, while tree height and basal area significantly influenced SOC. Pathway analysis showed that salinity affects BSCS variability directly and indirectly by regulating stand structure and restricting nutrients and forest functions, although basal area, nutrients, and LAI directly enhance RC stocks. Our results indicate that an increase in nutrient content, canopy density, species diversity, and leaf area index can enhance BSCS, as they improve forest functions and contribute to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

TI  - A comprehensive assessment of a new hybrid combined marine engine using alternative fuel blends
AB  - Large cargo that cannot be moved worldwide by air or rail transportation is typically conveyed via marine transportation, which relies on fossil fuels and contributes to global emissions. However, a more cost-effective solution is to utilize eco-friendly fuels to reduce carbon emissions. The design of a new hybridized powering system using environmentally friendly hydrogen-based fuel blends is investigated. This paper presents a new hybrid combined marine engine, which involves an internal combustion engine paired with a hybrid solid oxide fuel cell and gas turbine. The exergy, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental analyses are conducted on this proposed engine. It is found that the average net power is about 27 MW with an increase of 30\% and the energy and exergy efficiencies are 31\% and 41\%, respectively. In addition, the average exergetic efficiency based on fuel and product principle is 60\%. This new marine engine has 228 \$/h Levelized cost rate and 1109 mPt/h environmental rate. Finally, the average overall specific product exergy cost and environment are 64 \$/GJ and 22 mPt/MJ, respectively. Also, carbon emissions are significantly reduced by 35\%-61\%, depending on the fuel blend. Comparing five fuel blends, the methane and hydrogen fuel blend is the most economical and has the least impact on the environment, and the second option is the ethanol blend.

TI  - Carbonic Anhydrase-Embedded Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Frameworks Coating for Facilitated Offshore CO2 Fixation
AB  - Exhausted emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) from ships or offshore platforms has become one of the major contributors to global carbon emissions. Enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase (CA) have been widely used for CO2 mineralization because of their high catalytic rate. However, CA in seawater is easy to inactivate and difficult to reuse. Immobilization would be a feasible solution to address the stability issue, which, however, may cause an increase of internal diffusion resistance and reduced catalytic activity. In this regard, design of high-performance biocatalysts for acquiring high catalytic activity and stability of CA is highly desirable. Herein, a monolithic catalyst of Filler-CA@Lys-HOF-1 (FCLH) was prepared by chemical sorption of CA on the surface of the Filler followed by the coating of Lys-HOF-1. The highest catalytic activity of FCLH was obtained by regulating the amount of HOF-1 monomer added. Due to the protection of Lys-HOF-1, the FCLH showed good tolerance against acidity and salinity, which could retain about 80.2 \% of the original activity after 9 h incubation in simulated seawater. The catalytic activity of FCLH could retain 85.4 \% of the initial activity after 10 cycles. Hopefully, our study can provide a promising biocatalyst for CO2 mineralization, which may drive down carbon emissions when used for CO2 capture and conversion on offshore platforms.

TI  - Blue Carbon Stock in Zostera marina Meadows in the Ria de Ferrol (NW Iberian Peninsula)
AB  - The increase in greenhouse gases (GHG) has been constant since the Industrial Revolution. For this reason, different international organizations have devoted special attention to GHG sinks such as terrestrial soils and ecosystems. However, the initially estimated balances did not include the carbon stock associated with ocean waters, coastal soils and sediments, known as blue carbon. Currently, blue carbon sinks are the subject of numerous studies due to the limited information available, especially on the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula. We studied the organic C stock present in soils and in Zostera marina biomass in the two main meadows in the Ria de Ferrol (O Bano and Castelo de San Felipe). The carbon stock associated with biomass was 0.37 Mg C ha(-1), with 0.18 Mg C ha(-1) corresponding to the epigeal portion and 0.19 Mg C ha(-1) to the hypogeal portion. Soil carbon stock was much higher: 4.11 Mg C ha(-1) at a depth of 5 cm and 82.14 Mg C ha(-1) at a depth of 1 m. Together with carbon values in biomass, a stock of 82.5 Mg C ha(-1) was obtained for the whole Ria de Ferrol. Z. marina accounted for 8.25\% of total C in the Ria de Ferrol. These values were higher than those found in other regions. Isotope ratios (delta 13C, delta 15N) and C/N ratios indicated that the organic C stock in the O Bano soil may receive important organic matter inputs of terrestrial origin, while in San Felipe, it seems to have a marine origin.

TI  - Insights into CO2 removal mechanism via the carbonaceous surface in the exhaust gas of marine NG engines: A first-principles study
AB  - Carbon-based materials adsorption method is a promising technology on CO2 removal in exhaust-gas environ-ment for marine NG (Natural gas) engines. In the present study, the first-principles calculations are utilized to investigate CO2 adsorption capacity of the carbonaceous surface. The simulation results indicate that CO2 at different positions presents diverse adsorption characteristics. Simultaneously, the unsaturated carbon atoms on upper layer of the carbonaceous surface have better CO2 adsorption capacity. Moreover, a series of carbonaceous surface models have been calculated to examine CO2 adsorption behavior in the exhaust gas (containing CH4, O2, NO, NO2, H2O). It is found that CH4 can promote the adsorption capacity of CO2 on the carbonaceous surface and will not form competitive adsorption with CO2 when CH4 concentration is extremely low. Similarly, H2O and NO also have positive effect on CO2 adsorption. With the presence of O2 and NO2, the reverse appearance occurs. Noting that multiple oxygen atoms of the component are easier to gather electrons than the carbonaceous sur-face. The magnitude of charge transfer directly determines adsorption activity, so the carbonaceous surface with O2, NO2 assume weak CO2 adsorption capacity. This work provides a new insight into the field of CO2 adsorption.

TI  - Steady-state Analytical Reservoir Pressure and Temperature Solutions during Hydrogen Refueling to Environment-friendly Ships from Offshore Underground Storage
AB  - As hydrogen (H2) conserves intermittent electricity from renewable energies, H2-fueled ships are overlooked for carbon emission reduction. H2-fueled ships require offshore refueling for long-distance shipping routes. At offshore refueling stations, H2 is expected to be generated by renewable energies, stored in depleted offshore reservoirs, and then extracted for refueling. Temperature and pressure variations near the wellbore during H2 extraction impact the severity of hydrogen-induced corrosion. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct hydrothermal analysis for offshore platformsâ€™ front-end engineering design and operation strategy. This paper proposes an analytical reservoir pressure and temperature solution for steady-state offshore H2 extraction from depleted reservoirs for refueling. We derive the radial analytical solution for a two-phase flow (water-H2) and validate them with a numerical model. We apply the derived solution to sensitivity analysis with respect to water depth, reservoir depth, H2 saturation, permeability, reservoir thickness, and total extraction rate. Due to the negative water thermal gradient, deep water depth leads to pressurization and cooling near the wellbore. Critical H2 saturation is derived as a criterion of transition between Joule-Thomson heating and cooling. The higher flow mobility of H2 ensures less depressurization during extraction than water. Higher H2 saturation over the critical saturation causes less cooling due to the decreasing pressure gradient. Â© 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Energy recovery in a commercial building using pico-hydropower turbines: An Australian case study
AB  - Optimising energy use in systems and buildings is crucial to reduce climate change. This paper aims to address the gap in knowledge for pico-hydropower (<5 kW) that has been identified as an area of untapped potential in the water industries. A literature review and multivariate analysis are used to find a suitable pico-hydro turbine to install into a coral reef aquarium system in a government owned facility. Key findings from the literature review are untapped potential, gaps in knowledge and global quantification of small hydropower for energy recovery, and lack of enabling data contributing to slow uptake of small hydropower. The study showed a propeller pico-hydropower turbine could be used to recover approximately 10\% of the energy used for pumping water through a filtration system. At 2.3 m available head, and 90 L/s water flow, power output up to 1.124 kW was achieved. The project was economically viable with financial and non-financial benefits for the life cycle of the product. There remain sparse case studies for energy recovery using small hydropower in the scientific literature. A growing number of authors see the potential of this renewable energy technology to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals to provide affordable clean energy and address climate change. This study helps to shine a light on opportunities to find value from waste using a novel application of hydropower in a water industry.

TI  - Changes in Salinity, Mangrove Community Ecology, and Organic Blue Carbon Stock in Response to Cyclones at Indian Sundarbans
AB  - Climate change-induced frequent cyclones are pumping saline seawater into the Sundarbans. Fani, Amphan, Bulbul, and Yaas were the major cyclones that hit the region during 2019-2021. This study represents the changes in the soil parameters, mangrove biodiversity and zonation due to the cyclone surges in the Indian Sundarbans between 2017 and 2021. Increasing tidal water salinity (parts per thousand) trends in both pre-monsoon (21 to 33) and post-monsoon (14 to 19) seasons have been observed between 2017 and 2021. A 46\% reduction in the soil organic blue carbon pool is observed due to a 31\% increase in soil salinity. Soil organic blue carbon has been calculated by both wet digestion and the elemental analyzer method, which are linearly correlated with each other. A reduction in the available nitrogen (30\%) and available phosphorous (33\%) in the mangrove soil has also been observed. Salinity-sensitive mangroves, such as Xylocarpus granatum, Xylocarpus moluccensis, Rhizophora mucronata, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, and Bruguiera cylindrica, have seen local extinction in the sampled population. An increasing trend in relative density of salinity resilient, Avicennia marina, Suaeda maritima, Aegiceras corniculatum and a decreasing trend of true mangrove (Ceriops decandra) has been observed, in response to salinity rise in surface water as well as soil. As is evident from Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and the Abundance/Frequency ratio (A/F), the mangrove zonation observed in response to tidal gradient has also changed, becoming more homogeneous with a dominance of A. marina. These findings indicate that cyclone, climate change-induced sea level rise can adversely impact Sustainable Development Goal 13 (climate action), by decreasing organic soil blue carbon sink and Sustainable Development Goal 14 (life below water), by local extinction of salinity sensitive mangroves.

TI  - A socio-technical transition perspective on positive tipping points in climate change mitigation: Analysing seven interacting feedback loops in offshore wind and electric vehicles acceleration
AB  - This paper engages with climate mitigation debates on positive tipping points, which attract increasing attention but remain divided between technological and social tipping point approaches. Building on recent attempts to overcome this dichotomy, the paper develops a socio-technical transitions perspective which shows how co -evolutionary interactions between techno-economic improvements and actor reorientations can significantly accelerate diffusion. Mobilising insights from political science, discourse theory, business studies, consumption theory, and innovation studies, we elaborate the Multi-Level Perspective to articulate seven feedback loops in tipping point dynamics. We illustrate and test our co-evolutionary perspective with two case studies, UK offshore wind and electric vehicles. These case studies not only demonstrate the importance of interacting feedback loops, but also show a contrasting sequence in tipping point dynamics, with substantial techno-economic deployment preceding major actor reorientations in offshore wind, while following them in the EV case. The cases also indicate the crucial roles of policymakers in low-carbon tipping point dynamics as well as the importance of policy learning and social, political, and business feedbacks in strengthening and reorienting policy support.

TI  - Clarifying the role of inorganic carbon in blue carbon policy and practice
AB  - Since the term ``blue carbon{''} was coined by the report of Nellerman et al. (2009) the marine carbon cycle has firmly entered the realm of marine policy alongside its terrestrial neighbour, ``green carbon{'' (Crooks et al., 2018). Many marine policy decisions rely on accurate information concerning the stocks of blue carbon in a region, the annual sequestration rates associated with those stocks and the threats posed to those stocks by human activities, and especially recently by bottom-trawling (e.g., Sala et al., 2021). Hence policy officials are reliant on accurate blue carbon scientific advice. However, at the present moment there is one topic that is contributing confusion to policy-science understanding, and that is the topic of organic vs. inorganic carbon. The aim of this short note is to clarify the differences between these two types of blue carbon and to recommend how they are treated in policy formulation and the provision of scientific advice.

TI  - Reducing global land-use pressures with seaweed farming
AB  - Agricultural expansion to meet humanity's growing needs for food and materials is a leading driver of land-use change, exacerbating climate change and biodiversity loss. Seaweed biomass farmed in the ocean could help reduce demand for terrestrial crops and reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions by providing a substitute or supplement for food, animal feed and biofuels. Here we model the global expansion potential of seaweed farming and explore how increased seaweed utilization under five different scenarios that consider dietary, livestock feed and fuel production seaweed usage may affect the environmental footprint of agriculture. For each scenario, we estimate the change in environmental impacts on land from increased seaweed adoption and map plausible marine farming expansion on the basis of 34 commercially important seaweed species. We show that similar to 650 million hectares of global ocean could support seaweed farms. Cultivating Asparagopsis for ruminant feed provided the highest greenhouse gas mitigation of the scenarios considered (similar to 2.6 Gt CO(2)e yr(-1)). Substituting human diets at a rate of 10\% globally is predicted to spare up to 110 million hectares of land. We illustrate that global production of seaweed has the potential to reduce the environmental impacts of terrestrial agriculture, but caution is needed to ensure that these challenges are not displaced from the land to the ocean.

TI  - Improving the energy efficiency of lighting systems for a marine equipment manufacturing plant through retrofitting, daylighting, and behaviour change
AB  - As the emissions from the operation phase of ship's life cycle are reduced as a result of ongoing efforts, it is anticipated that the decarbonization of ship's manufacturing phase will gain more attention. Marine equipment manufacturing plants are highly energy-intensive and environmentally polluting segments of the shipbuilding industry, necessitating special consideration for environmental issues such as climate change. Through energyefficient lighting, this study aims to contribute to the promotion of clean production and energy management cultures in marine equipment manufacturing plants. An energy audit was conducted on the lighting systems of a marine equipment manufacturing plant based on the holistic consideration of the following key energy-saving measures: energy-efficiency retrofitting, daylighting, and behaviour change. The daylighting application for the foundry sections of the plant offered an 80\% reduction annually in the entire plant's energy use for lighting, associated costs, CO2 emissions, and external costs, along with an initial investment cost (IIC) of euro35.480, a net present value (NPV) of euro184.322,6, a benefit-to-cost (B/C) ratio of 3.7, and a discounted payback period (DPP) of 2.1 years. However, the proposed daylighting system was found to provide excessive and non-uniform illuminance in the workspaces during the summer days. On the other hand, LED technology satisfied the requirements for illuminance levels and uniformity. The LED application offered a 60.6\% reduction in the entire plant's lighting energy use, with an IIC of around euro17.052, a NPV of euro153.375, a B/C of 3.5, and a DPP of 1.25 years. The plant's carbon emissions can be reduced by about 33 tons annually, while approximately euro108.111 in external health costs per year could be avoided. Additionally, around a 3.2\% reduction in overall energy consumption with associated benefits can be achieved through energy-efficient behaviour by the employees.

TI  - Optimization of Fuel Consumption for an Offshore Supply Tug Using a Backtracking Algorithm
AB  - This paper introduces a backtracking algorithm for the fuel optimization of an offshore supply tugboat. The aim is to determine the optimal cruising speed that minimizes fuel use under operational constraints. Many older vessels in local offshore regions face limitations in adopting new fuel efficient technologies due to financial constraints. Hence, alternative cost-effective methods are needed to improve energy use and reduce emissions from these older ships. We propose using a backtracking algorithm to systematically explore all potential speed solutions and find the optimal one. Operational constraints like time restrictions and weather factors are incorporated during the optimization. The algorithm branches out to potential solutions and backtracks when they violate constraints. This allows for the pruning of infeasible solutions to improve the computational efficiency. The study provides the basis for optimizing offshore voyages as a sustainable transportation activity. Further work could expand the technique by adding parameters and real-time data.

TI  - The Removal of CH4 and NOx from Marine LNG Engine Exhaust by NTP Combined with Catalyst: A Review
AB  - Compared to diesel, liquefied natural gas (LNG), often used as an alternative fuel for marine engines, comes with significant advantages in reducing emissions of particulate matter (PM), SOx, CO2, and other pollutants. Promoting the use of LNG is of great significance for achieving carbon peaking and neutrality worldwide, as well as improving the energy structure. However, compared to diesel engines, medium- and high-speed marine LNG engines may produce higher methane (CH4) emissions and also have nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission issues. For the removal of CH4 and NOx from the exhaust of marine LNG engines, the traditional technical route of combining a methane oxidation catalyst (MOC) and an HN3 selective catalytic reduction system (NH3-SCR) will face problems, such as low conversion efficiency and high operation cost. In view of this, the technology of non-thermal plasma (NTP) combined with CH4-SCR is proposed. However, the synergistic mechanism between NTP and catalysts is still unclear, which limits the optimization of an NTP-CH4-SCR system. This article summarizes the synergistic mechanism of NTP and catalysts in the integrated treatment process of CH4 and NOx, including experimental analysis and numerical simulation. And the relevant impact parameters (such as electrode diameter, electrode shape, electrode material, and barrier material, etc.) of NTP reactor energy optimization are discussed. The work of this paper is of great significance for guiding the high-efficiency removal of CH4 and NOx for an NTP-CH4-SCR system.

TI  - Warming and flooding have different effects on organic carbon stability in mangrove soils
AB  - PurposeMangrove ecosystems which play a critical role in global C sequestration have recently become threatened by global warming and sea level rise. This study aimed to explore the responses of SOC mineralization and C pool stability in mangrove ecosystems to warming and flooding conditions.MethodsLaboratory incubation and solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR) analysis were used to evaluated soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization and stability under warming (ST), flooding (SW), warming in coincidence with flooding (SWT), and soil under normal temperature taken from a subtropical mangrove ecosystem in southeastern China.ResultsThe cumulative SOC mineralization of ST increased by 24\%, while SWT and SW decreased by 59\% and 68\% relative to CK, respectively. Furthermore, the 13C-NMR analysis showed that O-alkyl C was the dominant SOC chemical composition in all treatments (37.1-43.1\%), followed by the aromatic C and alkyl C. The aromaticity index (AI) decreased, and the ratio of alkyl and O-alkyl to aromatic (Alip/Arom) increased in all treatments compared with CK, while the alkyl C/O-alkyl C ratio (A/O-A) and hydrophobicity index (HI) were higher for ST and SW but lower for SWT. Warming significantly facilitated SOC mineralization, and lowered SOC stability due to the high cumulative CO2-C production, while flooding had the opposite effects. However, warming in coincidence with flooding led to low SOC decomposition and a more recalcitrant substance.ConclusionThe theoretical elevated CO2 release from mangrove soils under warming in coastal zones might be partially offset by prolonged flooding. The different effects on the chemical fractions, chemical compositions, and stability of the SOC pool in mangrove soil under warming and flooding might further complicate the research on coastal carbon sinks.

TI  - Optimization of sustainable seawater desalination: Modeling renewable energy integration and energy storage concepts
AB  - Many arid and semi-arid regions of the world face growing freshwater scarcity, requiring increased utilization of seawater desalination to augment the existing freshwater resources. Seawater reverse osmosis (RO) is currently one of the most deployed technologies, due to its electrical energy efficiency and comparatively low costs. However, the required energy for desalination processes is often still converted from fossil sources. Given the growing demand for seawater desalination and the energy sector's parallel decarbonization, the substitution by renewable energy sources (RES) is a critical issue. The volatility, lower availability of renewable energy, and cost for required electrical energy storage (EES) are all obstacles to the decarbonization of large-scale desalination plants and may affect production volume and water production costs negatively. This paper presents a mathematical model to determine a cost-optimal energy conversion and EES mix for the design and operation of large-scale seawater RO desalination plants. The linear program ensures satisfaction of the plant's energetic demands. Furthermore, the model allows to investigate the general feasibility of integrating RES into large-scale desalination processes, which are examined by means of a case study while employing location-specific weather data. Different types of energy conversion technologies and the effect of EES on operating behavior, greenhouse gas emissions, and water unit costs are investigated. Specifically, the indirect storage of electrical energy via the smart management of a desalination plant's oversized RO membranes is examined and compared to battery energy storage (BES). Results indicate that RES cannot meet an RO desalination plant's full and constant electrical load demand without a high BES capacity, which is probably not feasible from a technical and economic point of view. The economic penalty from energy storage costs on one unit of desalinated water ranges from 3.10 \$/m3 up to 5.38 \$/m3. However, operating an oversized RO desalination plant intermittently could reduce the energy-related costs substantially and potentially provide a more appropriate way of adapting to a volatile supply of energy from renewable sources in order to decarbonize the desalination processes. Specific emissions of desalinated water can be reduced from 1.5 kg CO2 eq./m3 when relying mostly on combined cycle gas turbines down to 0.124 kg CO2 eq./m3 by intermittent operation and fully relying on renewable energy sources.

TI  - Review on recycling energy resources and sustainability
AB  - Shifting the production and disposal of renewable energy as well as energy storage systems to-ward recycling is vital for the future of society and the environment. The materials that make up the systems have an adverse effect on the environment. If no changes are made, the CO2 emissions will continue to increase while also impacting vital resources such as contaminating water sources and wildlife, manifesting in rising sea levels, and air pollution. The development of renewable energy storage systems (RESS) based on recycling utility and energy storage have been an important step in making renewable energy more readily available and more reliable. The emergence of RESS has revolutionized the way energy is obtained and stored for future uses. RESS such as those based on recycling utility and energy storage, provide a reliable and efficient means to harvest, store and provide energy from renewable sources on a large scale. The potential to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, increase energy security, and help protect the environment makes RESS an important tool in the fight against climate change. As the technology evolves, such systems will continue to play a vital role in the green energy revolution, providing access to a reliable, efficient, and cost-effective power source. This paper provides an overview of the current research on recycling utility based renewable energy storage systems, including their compo-nents, power sources, benefits, and challenges. Finally, it assesses potential methods to overcome the challenges and improve the efficiency and reliability of the recycling utility based renewable energy storage systems.

TI  - Conversion of natural coastal wetlands to mariculture ponds dramatically decreased methane production by reducing substrate availability
AB  - Coastal wetlands are increasingly being converted into aquaculture ponds to meet growing global demand for fish protein. Coastal wetlands conversion has been predicted to result in significant carbon (C) emissions; however, a mechanistic understanding of the effects of coastal wetland conversion on soil's capacity to produce greenhouse gases remains lacking. Here, integrated biogeochemical investigations on methanogenic substrates, community structures, and activities were conducted in a coastal Spartina alterniflora saltmarsh and three saltmarsh-converted mariculture ponds aged 6, 13, and 20 years. Saltmarsh conversion into mariculture ponds decreased CH4 production potential from 353 to 16.3-78.3 \& mu;g CH4 kg- 1 d-1. The concentrations of dissolved organic C and non-competitive methanogenic substrate, trimethylamine, were reduced by 84.8\% and 79.7\%, respectively, whereas methanogens abundance decreased by 43.7\%, probably due to the decreased C input following conversion. Among the ponds, CH4 production potential, methanogenic substrates (acetate and trimethylamine), and methanogen abundance decreased with conversion chronosequence. However, the dominant methanogen group did not shift after land conversion, and the potential methylamine-utilizing Methanosarcinaceae accounted for 86.5\% and 85.3-89.7\% of the total populations in the S. alterniflora saltmarsh and mariculture ponds, respectively, implying that methylotrophic methanogenesis was the predominant pathway of CH4 production in both ecosystems. The results indicated that the conversion of natural coastal saltmarsh to mariculture ponds decreased CH4 production by reducing substrate availability and methanogen abundance, and CH4 production potential in mariculture ponds was more efficiently suppressed with conversion chronosequence.

TI  - Utilizing Locally Available Bioresources for Powering Remote Indigenous Communities: A Framework and Case Study
AB  - We establish a framework to examine the feasibility of using local vegetation for bioenergy power systems in small-scale applications and remote settings. The framework has broad application, and we present a specific case here to demonstrate the process. Our case study is the Tiwi Islands in northern Australia, where a large Acacia mangium plantation is a potential source of biofuel feedstock. Two types of technology were considered: 1. Bio-oil from pyrolysis in diesel generators and 2. Direct combustion coupled with a steam turbine. The biomass was characterized and found to have adequate properties for an energy crop, with a lower heating value of about 18 MJ/kg and entire tree ash content of 2\%. Measurements from trees that were damaged from wildfires had similar results, showing potential value recovery for a plantation after unplanned fire. In comparison to a petroleum diesel-based generator, the bio-oil system was 12\% more expensive. The direct combustion system was found to be the most economical of those explored here, costing as low as 61\% of the bio-oil system. Additional social and environmental benefits were identified, including local employment opportunities, improved energy security and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Our findings of high techno-economic potential of bioenergy systems, especially through direct combustion, are widely applicable to on-demand renewable energy supply in remote communities.

TI  - Comparative environmental and economic life cycle assessment of phytoremediation of dredged sediment using Arundo Donax, integrated with biomass to bioenergy valorization chain
AB  - The economic and environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) was integrated into a laboratory-based experiment to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of phytoremediation of chloride-rich marine dredged sediment, using perennial reed Arundo Donax along with biomass valorization. As a prerequisite for life cycle assessments, a baseline mathematical model was developed to estimate the yields of biomass to bioenergy valorization chain including the estimation of biomass yield per m3 sediment, bioenergy yields from valorization schemes, expected green electricity yield, and the phytoremediation time frame. This mathematical model was applied to develop a parametric life cycle inventory for two scenarios of sediment phytoremediation separately or integrated with biomass valorization, for LCA and further sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Comparative LCA unveiled that the cost and environmental impacts of annual phytoremediation of 1m3 sediment alone or integrated with biomass valorization are much inferior to the corresponding sediment landfill as the inevitable alternative approach for sediment management. With the chloride bioaccumulation capacity of 9940 mg per kg dry biomass of A. donax, the phytoremediation of sediment with chloride concentration higher than 1650 mg/kg may not be achievable in a realistic time frame. Due to the importance of considering sediment depth and the effectiveness of the plant rooting system in estimating the performance of phytoremediation and the time frame, the volume of sediment (1m3) is a more appropriate functional unit than the surface area (ha) for LCA studies of phytoremediation. In addition, considering the volume of sediment as a functional unit retains comparability to other valorization scenarios such as sediment incorporation in cementitious matrices and management scenarios such as landfill, which are generally expressed on a volume or mass basis. Integrating biomass-derived bioenergy production into phytoremediation could offer local and global benefits in terms of economy and environment mainly due to carbon sequestration and avoiding fossil-based fuels.

TI  - Shifting to Sustainable Shipping: Actors and Power Shifts in Shipping Emissions in the IMO
AB  - Emissions from shipping have consequences for human health and climate change, yet achieving policy change to reduce these emissions remains challenging on a global scale. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN Agency tasked with formal international policy-making for the maritime sector, stands at the center of a complex maritime governance architecture. Yet, it is often criticized for heavy industry influence and power concentrated in the hands of a few actors. There has been recent research supporting this, while other research suggests that there are new actors influencing the agenda on shipping emissions. This article examines if the increasingly multi-actor and multi-layered governance architecture in shipping means that the actors and power in the IMO have shifted as well. The data were compiled from a selected sampling of the IMO documents from the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC) meetings between 1988 and 2021. The paper follows the agenda item of focus, `Air Pollution', as it evolves over time and identifies actors utilizing three indicators of influence, submissions to the MEPC, the ISWG-GHG, and the delegations at the MEPC meetings. The research shows that some of the early state actors on this issue are still highly active (Norway, Japan, US), while other actors emerge over time (China, Marshall Islands). The emergence of the NGO Clean Shipping Coalition is notable, as is the complex role of the European Commission. Industry associations and flag states maintain active roles, yet the changes noted suggest they do not have the same influence they once did over emissions issues in the IMO.

TI  - Faster accumulation and greater contribution of glomalin to the soil organic carbon pool than amino sugars do under tropical coastal forest restoration
AB  - Microbial metabolic products play a vital role in maintaining ecosystem multifunctionality, such as soil physical structure and soil organic carbon (SOC) preservation. Afforestation is an effective strategy to restore degraded land. Glomalin-related soil proteins (GRSP) and amino sugars are regarded as stable microbial-derived C, and their distribution within soil aggregates affects soil structure stability and SOC sequestration. However, the information about how afforestation affects the microbial contribution to SOC pools within aggregates is poorly understood. We assessed the accumulation and contribution of GRSP and amino sugars within soil aggregates along a restoration chronosequence (Bare land, Eucalyptus exserta plantation, native species mixed forest, and native forest) in tropical coastal terraces. Amino sugars and GRSP concentrations increased, whereas their contributions to the SOC pool decreased along the restoration chronosequence. Although microaggregates harbored greater microbial abundances, amino sugars and GRSP concentrations were not significantly affected by aggregate sizes. Interestingly, the contributions of amino sugars and GRSP to SOC pools decreased with decreasing aggregate size which might be associated with increased accumulation of plant-derived C. However, the relative change rate of GRSP was consistently greater in all restoration chronosequences than that of amino sugars. The accumulation of GRSP and amino sugars in SOC pools was closely associated with the dynamics of soil fertility and the microbial community. Our findings suggest that GRSP accumulates faster and contributes more to SOC pools during restoration than amino sugars did which was greatly affected by aggregate sizes. Afforestation substantially enhanced soil quality with native forest comprising species sequestering more SOC than the monoculture plantation did. Such information is invaluable for improving our mechanistic understanding of microbial control over SOC preservation during degraded ecosystem restoration. Our findings also show that plantations using arbuscular mycorrhizal plants can be an effective practice to sequester more soil carbon during restoration.

TI  - Ship voyage optimization based on fuel consumption under various operational conditions
AB  - Aiming at reducing ship emissions and lower operational cost, less fuel consumption is always pursued by shipping industry. Compared with other methods on reducing the fuel consumption, such as optimizing the design of hull lines or ship propulsion system, setting additional energy saving device, the voyage optimization is a way which is easier to implement and needs less investment cost. In this paper, an integrated simulation model of ship propulsion and maneuvering system is established and verified. Then, a benchmark 38800 t cargo ship and a 32n miles coastal service are selected for the case study. Based on the ship operating characteristic and voyage environments, 24 representative cases of combination about the voyage set up and ship control modes are proposed. The ship fuel consumptions under 24 cases are calculated using the integrated simulation model. Finally, fuel consumption change under different conditions are analyzed and the most reasonable case of saving fuel consumption is provided. This study tries to investigate the influence of multiple factors on the ship fuel consumption considering the realistic and representative operating conditions, and provides theoretical suggestions for ship propulsion and maneuvering control, voyage planning and engine management for reducing fuel consumption over ship voyages.

TI  - To what extent does renewable energy deployment reduce pollution indicators? the moderating role of research and development expenditure: Evidence from the top three ranked countries
AB  - Climate change, pollution, drought, and rising seas impede the achievement of the seventh sustainable development goal SDG\#7 ``affordable and clean energies ``. To counter these threats, the use of Renewable Energy (RE) as an alternative to conventional energy plays an important role in sustainable development. In this context, the purpose of our paper is to investigate the effect of Renewable Energy deployment on environmental protection in China, The United States of America (USA), and Germany: the top three ranked countries in terms of REs production, according to RENEWABLE 2021 GLOBAL STATUSREPORT. To achieve this objective, the paper adopts a Panel fully modified OLS (FMOLS) method. Results declare that renewable energy significantly reduce pollution indicators; furthermore, we find that Research and development fully moderate this relationship. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of increasing spending on Research and development activities in the RE sector. In addition, the countries studied and countries around the world should pay greater attention to investment in research and development to support the long-term plan for advancing sustainable energy sources for feasible energy and economic development.

TI  - A novel bi-level optimization model-based optimal energy scheduling for hybrid ship power system
AB  - With the rapid growth of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the application of traditional ships brings more and more serious pollution problems to the marine environment. For this reason, this paper aims at developing a novel optimal energy scheduling for hybrid ship power system based on bi-level optimization model to reduce fossil fuel consumption and protect the environment. Firstly, a hybrid ship power system model including the diesel generator system, energy storage system, propulsion system, service load system, and photovoltaic generation system is established. Taking the nonlinear and non-convex constraints in solving power generation scheduling and speed scheduling problems into account, an improved genetic algorithm-based bi-level energy optimization strategy is developed. Considering the mileage constraints in coupling constraints, an upper level model for ship energy scheduling is established with the objective of reducing fuel consumption; a lower level optimization model with the goal of minimizing mileage deviation is established through constraint decomposition and fed back to the upper level optimization model. Considering the normal and fault navigation conditions, simulation results verify that the proposed method can significantly minimize operating costs and greenhouse gas emissions by 5.33\% and 2.46\%, respectively.

TI  - State-of-the-Art Review on Shipboard Microgrids: Architecture, Control, Management, Protection, and Future Perspectives
AB  - Shipboard microgrids (SBMGs) are becoming increasingly popular in the power industry due to their potential for reducing fossil-fuel usage and increasing power production. However, operating SBMGs poses significant challenges due to operational and environmental constraints. To address these challenges, intelligent control, management, and protection strategies are necessary to ensure safe operation under complex and uncertain conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive review of SBMGs, including their classifications, control, management, and protection, as well as the most recent research statistics in these areas. The state-of-the-art SBMG types, propulsion systems, and power system architectures are discussed, along with a comparison of recent research contributions and issues related to control, uncertainties, management, and protection in SBMGs. In addition, a bibliometric analysis is performed to examine recent trends in SBMG research. This paper concludes with a discussion of research gaps and recommendations for further investigation in the field of SBMGs, highlighting the need for more research on the optimization of SBMGs in terms of efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness, as well as the development of advanced control and protection strategies to ensure safe and stable operation.

TI  - Effects of split diesel injection strategies on combustion, knocking, cyclic variations and emissions of a natural gas-diesel dual fuel medium speed engine
AB  - Accelerated by the harms and depletion risk of fossil fuels, transition to low-carbon or renewable fuels have become an urgent need for combustion engines to decarbonize transport sectors. Natural gas-diesel dual-fuel combustion is a promising method to achieve these goals by allowing the usage of natural gas in diesel engines. However, this concept has drawbacks of low combustion efficiency, high unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions and high cyclic variations at low engine loads. These drawbacks hinder the benefits of dual-fuel such as low NOx and soot emissions. To find solutions to these drawbacks, split diesel injections with variable injection timings and mass split ratios (ratio of first injection diesel mass to total diesel mass) were investigated experimentally and numerically on a medium speed marine engine at low load using constant natural gas and diesel amounts. Experimental results of the split injection were compared to single injection dual-fuel and conventional diesel operation. Single injection case resulted in slightly lower HC emissions and cyclic variations and higher NOx emissions than split cases in a narrow injection timing interval. Apart from that, split injections increased combustion efficiency and decreased cyclic variations in a broader timing interval. For split cases, early first injection timing prevented high premixed heat release peak, suppressed NOx emissions and knocking. Especially, using 70\% split ratio with retarded second injections increased combustion efficiency, decreased knocking level and provided simultaneous reduction of HC and NOx emissions compared to lower split ratio cases. In short, despite not giving the minimum values at all conditions, split injection showed potential to find a remedy to high HC emissions and cyclic variations issues by keeping robust operation in a wider injection timing interval. The numerical results support the experiments in which better combustion and decreased HC emissions are attained using sufficiently early diesel injections. Simulations show that, compared to late single injection, early single injection dual-fuel case enables more homogeneous temperature distribution and better oxidization of methane near the cylinder wall and central region above the piston crown. Besides, split injection shows improved methane oxidation near the cylinder wall and inside top-land crevice volume.

TI  - Techno-Economic Comparison of Dual-fuel Marine Engine Waste Energy Recovery Systems
AB  - Nowadays alternative and innovative energy recovery solutions are adopted on board ships to reduce fuel consumption and harmful emissions. According to this, the present work compares the engine exhaust gas waste heat recovery and hybrid turbocharger technologies, which are used to improve the efficiency of a dual-fuel four-stroke (DF) marine engine. Both solutions aim to satisfy partly or entirely the ship's electrical and/or thermal loads. For the engine exhaust gas waste heat recovery, two steam plant schemes are considered: the single steam pressure and the variable layout (single or dual steam pressure plant). In both cases, a heat recovery steam generator is used for the electric power energy generation through a steam turbine. The hybrid turbocharger is used to provide a part of the ship's electric loads as well. The thermodynamic mathematical models of DF engines, integrated with the energy recovery systems, are developed in a Matlab-Simulink environment, allowing the comparison in terms of performance at different engine loads and fuels, which are Natural Gas (NG) and High Fuel Oil (HFO). The use of NG always involves better efficiency of the system for all the engine working conditions. It results that the highest efficiency value achievable is 56\% at 50\% maximum continuous rating (MCR) engine load.

TI  - A Numerical Model Comparison of the Energy Conversion Process for an Offshore Hydro-Pneumatic Energy Storage System
AB  - Energy storage is essential if net zero emissions are to be achieved. In fact, energy storage is a leading solution for reducing curtailment in an energy system that relies heavily on intermittent renewables. This paper presents a comparison between two numerical models which simulate the energy conversion unit performance of a hydro-pneumatic energy storage system. Numerical modelling is performed in Python (TM) (Alpha Model) and Mathworks (R) Simulink (R) and Simscape (TM) (Beta Model). The modelling aims to compare the time-series predictions for the simplified model (Alpha Model) with the more physically representative model (Beta Model). The Alpha Model provides a quasi-steady-state solution, while the Beta Model accounts for machinery inertias and friction within hydraulic flow circuits. Results show that the energy conversion performance simulations between the two models compare well, with a notable difference during system start-up due to the inclusion of transients in the Beta Model. Given its simplicity, the Alpha Model has high computational efficiency, while the Beta Model requires more computational time due to its complexity. This study showed that, despite its simplicity, the Alpha Model is able to generate results that are very similar to those from the Beta Model (with the average RMSE being less than 5\%).

TI  - ``Cooling credits{''} are not a viable climate solution
AB  - As the world struggles to limit warming to 1.5 or 2 \& DEG;C below pre-industrial temperatures, research into solar climate interventions that could temporarily offset some amount of greenhouse gas-driven global warming by reflecting more sunlight back out to space has gained prominence. These solar climate intervention techniques would aim to cool the Earth by injecting aerosols (tiny liquid or solid particles suspended in the atmosphere) into the upper atmosphere or into low-altitude marine clouds. In a new development, ``cooling credits{'' are now being marketed that claim to offset a certain amount of greenhouse gas warming with aerosol-based cooling. The science of solar climate intervention is currently too uncertain and the quantification of effects insufficient for any such claims to be credible in the near term. More fundamentally, however, the environmental impacts of greenhouse gases and aerosols are too different for such credits to be an appropriate instrument for reducing climate risk even if scientific uncertainties were narrowed and robust monitoring systems put in place. While some form of commercial mechanism for solar climate intervention implementation, in the event it is used, is likely, ``cooling credits{''} are unlikely to be a viable climate solution, either now or in the future.

TI  - Seaweed supplementation to organic dairy cows may reduce climate impact of manure in pasture soils during a laboratory incubation
AB  - IntroductionEnteric methane (CH4) emissions are one of the largest components of the anthropogenic CH4 budget, and with accelerating climatic changes, there are calls to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Certain seaweeds fed as supplements can reduce enteric CH4 emissions from ruminant animals by as much as 80\%; however, these studies have yet to analyze downstream impacts that may arise from the deposit of affected manures on pastures or agricultural fields.Materials and MethodsHere we conducted a 28-day soil and manure incubation utilizing manures collected from dairy cows in a seaweed feeding trial to analyze the impacts of manure on greenhouse gas fluxes and nutrient cycling. Cows were fed different diets with a control group (no seaweed supplementation), and a 3\% and 6\% by dry-weight seaweed (Chondrus crispus) supplementation. Three soil moisture treatments were also tested, with a field moist capacity {[}67\% gravimetric water content (GWC)], a drier group (50\% GWC), and a saturated treatment (84\% GWC).ResultsWe found that manure from seaweed-fed cows reduced emissions of carbon dioxide and had similar emissions of methane and nitrous oxide to the control. Higher moisture levels increased CH4 emissions and nitrous oxide emissions with CH4 emissions trending higher in seaweed supplements trending higher in. Inorganic nitrogen turnover varied more based on moisture levels than seaweed supplements, as did the magnitude of methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Total carbon and nitrogen mostly decreased except in the 3\% seaweed supplementation, which increased carbon and nitrogen with a drop in C:N in the 50\% GWC group.ConclusionSeaweed supplements may partially reduce climate impacts of manures from cows fed seaweed supplements or at least not cause harm or impact manure quality. Given feeds may reduce enteric CH4 emissions, they may be a part of a successful strategy to reduce climate impacts of cattle.

TI  - How green desalination via SMRs is? A techno-environmental assessment of conceptual designs for MED-TVC and RO hybrid desalination
AB  - Desalination raises concerns about the highly saline brine left after the process and usually disposed of in the sea and oceans. Further, desalination is an energy intensive process and since most of the operational units are powered using conventional fossil fuel, they are continually affecting the environment. The concerns of ecosystem degradation have always restricted the growth of the desalination industry. Due to the strong features of small modular reactors, the SMR-based desalination plants could offer significant improvements in the area of desalination environmental impacts. In this regard, this study investigates the techno-environmental aspects of three state-of-art conceptual MED-RO hybrid desalination systems coupled with a single NuScale SMR power unit to reduce the adverse discharge brine impacts. Hybridization of desalination systems could achieve the comparative advantages of both thermal distillation and membrane desalination aiming to address the socio-economic impacts originating from desalination. For this purpose, several new introduced parameters, including exergetic efficiency, Power-to-Water ratio, specific discharge salinity, intake-seawater-to-brine ratio, discharge stream enthalpy, and net greenhouse gas emissions precluded by using NuScale for different hybrid desalination schemes are assessed. The analysis was completed with the aid of the MATLAB software and THERMOFLEX module using an Excel interface. The main finding of this study is that marine impacts are better justified in hybrid desalination schemes and that further use clean reactor energy source would decrease the environmental burdens. The results show that in case of fully integrated hybrid system 244,000 tons of CO2, 1012 tons of SO2 and 910 tons of NOx could be precluded annually from releasing into the atmosphere. However, hybrid systems generally have more significant marine effects which demonstrates the necessitated further studies and corrective actions.

TI  - Perceptions of practitioners on the importance and achievement of research and social implementation activities on marine and freshwater carbon
AB  - Research and social implementation related to carbon in marine and freshwater ecosystems are increasingly gaining emphasis in the global quest to achieve carbon neutrality. It is important not only to advance academic research, but also to solve practical problems for improved understanding, maintenance, and dissemination of information on carbon in marine or freshwater areas. In this study, we conducted a questionnaire survey of participants in activities related to carbon in marine or freshwater areas in Japan to clarify which issues were considered important and their understanding of the degree to which activities related to carbon in marine or freshwater areas had been achieved. Based on the responses to all questions, 77.9\% of respondents, on average, among the practitioners in marine areas recognized the importance of the program strongly, while 46.5\% recognized that the degree of achievement was insufficient. This tendency was more pronounced for carbon in freshwater than in marine areas(72.2\% and 48.6\%, respectively). The results, grouped by respondent attributes, revealed that the perception of importance and level of achievement varied depending on the organization of the activity, age, and years of knowledge of carbon in marine and/or freshwater areas. Practitioners with greater experience and those working on specific implementations perceived implementation-related aspects as more important and less accomplished than academic ones. This study provides valuable insights into the research aspects of carbon in marine and/or freshwater areas to achieve carbon neutrality.

TI  - Analysis of the Wave Attenuating and Dynamic Behaviour of a Floating Breakwater Integrating a Hydro-Pneumatic Energy Storage System
AB  - Floating breakwaters have recently been generating increasing interest as a vital means to provide shelter and protect the ever-increasing number of structures deployed at sea. Notwithstanding the novel ideas being put forward, to date, floating breakwater deployment has been limited to inshore and shallow water areas. The scale of such structures has been restricted to the smaller spectrum. Furthermore, whilst some concepts to integrate floating breakwaters with other offshore systems have been proposed to benefit from cost-sharing strategies, studies related to floating breakwaters integrating energy storage are lacking in the open literature. The present research investigates the wave attenuating and dynamic performance of a large-scale floating breakwater in deep seas with a hydro-pneumatic energy storage system also integrated within the structure. This article highlights the arising need for floating breakwaters and sheds light on the present-day technological status of floating wave breakers. It then lays the ground for the proposed, novel floating breakwater concept that aims to address the current knowledge gaps in this field of study. The simulation results generated from numerical modelling via the potential flow solver ANSYS (R) AQWA (TM) have been promising, connoting that the addition of hydro-pneumatic energy storage to a floating breakwater will not lead to a degradation in the dynamic performance or wave breaking efficiency of the floating structure.

TI  - Additional N Input May Alter the Species-Specific Blue Carbon Cycling Differently in Mangroves
AB  - Aquaculture is one of the fastest-growing economic activities in the world that results in a high amount of nitrogen-rich wastewater discharge into mangroves and affects the plant tissue's decomposition. However, a comprehensive analysis of above-and belowground litter affected by the nitrogen (N) input is rare. This study investigated the responses of above-and belowground litter decomposition to the different levels of N input in decomposition rates, chemical components, and the release of chemical compounds. Exogenous N input had stimulating, retarding, or even no effect on plants' litter decomposition and nutrient release in mangroves. The above-and belowground litter decompositions had different responses to anthropogenic N addition and varied among different mangrove species. The mechanism of the impacts of anthropogenic nitrogen input varies depending on species identity, litter composition, and additional N level. These results show that N enrichment in mangroves can be beneficial and detrimental to ecosystem function. For the native mangrove species, Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina, the belowground tissues that had a direct correlation with carbon accumulation were significantly influenced by the additional N input.

TI  - Review on Experimental Investigation into Formation Damage during Geologic Carbon Sequestration: Advances and Outlook
AB  - Carbon capture and storage has been identified as an important and viable technology for climate change mitigation. The technology allows CO2 generated from largescale sources, such as power plants and other heavy industries, to be captured and stored in deep geological formations. However, when CO2 is stored in geological formations, there are possibilities of formation damage, which may reduce injectivity and storage capacity. In this study, formation damage during CO2 injection and storage is reviewed through different experimental studies. The study has shown that the interaction between CO2, formation water, and rock minerals often results in mineral dissolution and precipitation, which affect reservoir permeability and porosity, which could possibly cause formation damage, compromising the reservoir storage capacity. This study also reveals that formation damage could be caused by the precipitation of sulfate scales, salt, and carbonate minerals. Additionally, in several studies, rock minerals were observed to dissolve and create free particles that were transported to occupy pore spaces along the fluid flow path, reducing permeability and impacting CO2 injectivity and storage. It is worth noting that the reviewed experiments present short-term effects of formation damage on geological formations, while in reality, CO2 storage is a long-term project, thus eliciting the need for more studies in that regard.

TI  - Sediment Properties and Benthic Fauna Associated with Stock Enhancement and Farming of Marine Bivalve Populations in Xiangshan Bay, China
AB  - This study was designed to examine the impacts of ark shell Scapharca subcrenata enhancement and suspended oyster Crassostrea sikamea farming on sediment properties and fauna communities in the benthic zone of Xiangshan Bay, China. Ark shell enhancement took place over 319 days, after which sediment samples were collected from each of the three treatment sites: the enhancement area, an oyster farm, and a control area. Sediments from the oyster farming area had significantly higher moisture and acid volatile sulfide content, and the highest Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd concentrations in all three treatment areas. The ark shell enhancement area has the lowest total organic carbon. No significant difference was found between the mean grain size in each of the three areas. Benthic fauna communities in the ark shell enhancement area were similar to those in the control area. Among the 16 faunal taxa identified, Ruditapes philippinarum was the most abundant species, followed by Glycera onomichiensis and Musculus senhousia. Suspension feeders were not found in the sediment beneath the oyster rafts. Cluster analysis showed a distinct separation between the benthic fauna communities in the oyster farming area and the other two treatment areas. Ark shell enhancement was thus shown to have minimal impact on the benthic environment, while the raft-farmed oysters had significant effects on the sediment structure and the benthic fauna after more than ten years of farming. The differences between the impacts of ark shell enhancement and oyster farming could be attributed to the slowing of water flow caused by oyster rafts.

TI  - Weather the storms? Resilience investment and production losses after hurricanes
AB  - This paper studies whether resilience investment mitigates damages from extreme weather events using data on offshore oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. We show that hurricanes which pass near rigs lower production and that stronger storms have larger impacts which persist for months. Regulatory changes that required rigs be designed to be resilient to major hurricanes only modestly mitigated the short-run production losses from hurricanes, reducing oil production losses by roughly 5\% at 1 month and 20\% 8 months after impact. They also only partly mitigated long-run losses, lowering the probability that a rig permanently exits production by 12-18 percentage points after a hurricane.

TI  - Short-term acidification promotes diverse iron acquisition and conservation mechanisms in upwelling-associated phytoplankton
AB  - Coastal upwelling regions are among the most productive marine ecosystems but may be threatened by amplified ocean acidification. Increased acidification is hypothesized to reduce iron bioavailability for phytoplankton thereby expanding iron limitation and impacting primary production. Here we show from community to molecular levels that phytoplankton in an upwelling region respond to short-term acidification exposure with iron uptake pathways and strategies that reduce cellular iron demand. A combined physiological and multi-omics approach was applied to trace metal clean incubations that introduced 1200 ppm CO2 for up to four days. Although variable, molecular-level responses indicate a prioritization of iron uptake pathways that are less hindered by acidification and reductions in iron utilization. Growth, nutrient uptake, and community compositions remained largely unaffected suggesting that these mechanisms may confer short-term resistance to acidification; however, we speculate that cellular iron demand is only temporarily satisfied, and longer-term acidification exposure without increased iron inputs may result in increased iron stress. Coastal upwelling regions are among the most productive marine ecosystems but may be threatened by amplified ocean acidification. Here the authors show from community to molecular levels that phytoplankton in an upwelling region respond to short-term acidification exposure with iron uptake pathways and strategies that reduce cellular iron demand.

TI  - Systems approaches for sustainable fisheries: A comprehensive review and future perspectives
AB  - Recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs) have been identified as having high potential for aquaculture development, attributed to their significant advantages, such as higher productivity, reduced water consumption, and improved sustainability. However, increased energy requirements due to the high amount of water recycling and temperature control leads to high operational costs and added environmental impacts from the use of fossil fuels, causing a barrier to their widespread deployment. This study examines the potential for renewable energy integration with RASs to improve their financial and environmental feasibility, while also presenting an overview of its potential and challenges for system optimisation modelling, which is presently absent in the existing literature. Renewable energy coupled with more efficient practices through process integration and advanced monitoring has the potential to make the system more sustainable and profitable. This study offers a compre-hensive understanding of the sustainability challenges concerning energy demands in RASs, the significant po-tential for growth by adopting renewable energy and wider dynamic systems optimisation modelling, and directions for problem-solving using energy optimisation models. To address the challenges of intermittency and instability that arise in the development of renewable energy for RAS, more research on economic and energy optimisation is needed to meet the requirements of design, planning, scheduling, operation, and control of aquaculture. Systematic decision-making guidelines for greater energy efficiency in aquaculture based on system optimisation modelling can improve the sustainability of aquaculture and help to address UN Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs). With new technological advances in renewable energy, artificial intelligence and water treatment, system-based optimisation models may help identifying which renewable energy types, tech-nology options and energy efficiency improvements should be integrated into different aquaculture systems to transform the economic competitiveness and sustainability of the industry.

Herein, Fe2+/PMS achieved a significantly higher reduction of negative charge of algae-laden seawater as compared to conventional coagulation (i.e., coagulant is Fe3+), which thereby facilitated improved flocculation to remove algal cells, turbidity and algal organics matters (AOMs), and marine Ca2+ (similar to 430 mg/L) could partially contribute to the enhanced coagulation performance. A new understanding of the improved coagulation efficiency achieved with Fe2+/PMS in seawater has been proposed as compared to freshwater: seawater matrix (e.g., 504 mM Cl-) was demonstrated to significantly enhance the generation of high-valent iron (FeO2+) as the main reactive intermediate instead of the long-recognized Fe3+ and free radicals, as revealed by methyl phenyl sulfoxide (PMSO) probe, radicals scavenging analysis and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra. This new mechanism is expected to provide valuable insights for the development of more novel oxidative seawater treatment technologies. Of note, while trade-off between particles and AOMs played an important role in membrane fouling reduction by different dosages of Fe2+/PMS, Fe2+/PMS with an optimal dosage of 0.1 mM/0.05 mM achieved an unprecedentedly higher reduction (95.26\%) of modified fouling index (MFI) as compared to conventional coagulation (13.28\%-42.36\% with 0.1-0.2 mM of Fe3+). Optical-photothermal infrared spectromicroscopy with sub-micron spatial resolution was employed to analyze membrane foulants for the first time, and Fe2+/PMS was found to mainly cause reduced cake layer resistance, which was attributed to the collectively reduced concentration of algae cells, micro-particles with sizes from 2 to 10 mu m, humic substances and biopolymers. Moreover, Fe2+/PMS resulted in lower dissolved Fe3+ (<0.027 mg/L) in ultrafiltration (UF) permeate, which would make it more reliable for SWRO operation as compared to conventional coagulation. When energy-intensive dissolved air flotation (DAF) was employed to withstand HAB, Fe2+/PMS outperformed it and was instrumental in achieving reduced MFI with 56.4\% lower operational cost. In this context, Fe2+/PMS would facilitate a high-performance and low-cost pretreatment technology for seawater desalination plants under HAB.

TI  - New Research of Borehole Wall Protection Technology in Ocean Scientific Drilling
AB  - In the process of ocean scientific drilling, borehole accidents (e.g., borehole collapse, burying of drill tools, and sticking of drill tools) are often caused by borehole wall instability in loose and broken strata. It is very difficult to deal with such accidents, and the drill pipe in the borehole has to be discarded in serious cases. Therefore, the stability of the borehole wall seriously affects the drilling quality and efficiency. At present, there are three effective methods of ensuring wellbore stability: casing, drilling fluid, and agent plugging technology. Casing can effectively prevent instability of all types of unstable formations and can isolate different pressure zones. Using the proper drilling fluid can control drilling fluid loss, reduce free water infiltration into the borehole wall, and form a thin and dense mud skin, which is conducive to the stability of the borehole wall. Agent plugging technology, especially chemical gels, is mainly aimed at the broken zone. After entering the formation, it makes the entire broken zone form a single high strength unit, improves the cementation ability of the lost formation, and improves the sealing and bearing capacity in order to achieve the purpose of sealing and plugging of leaks. In this paper, the present situation, technical principles, and technological processes of wall protection technology in ocean scientific drilling are summarized, and the different types of wall protection technology were researched and tested. The results of this study provide a reference for international ocean scientific drilling in the future.

TI  - Experimental study of dispersed flow in the thermopressor of the intercooling system for marine and stationary power plants compressors
AB  - This study investigates the use of a thermopressor to achieve highly dispersed liquid atomization, with a primary focus on its application in enhancing contact cooling systems of the cyclic air for gas turbines. The use of a thermopressor results in a substantial reduction in the average droplet diameter, specifically to less than 25 mu m, within the dispersed flow. Due to practically instantaneous evaporation of highly atomized liquid droplets in accelerated superheated air the pressure drop is reduced to minimum. A further increase of the air pressure takes place in diffuser. In its turn, this allows for the compensation of hydraulic pressure losses in the air path, thereby reducing compressive work. Experimental data uncover a significant decrease in the average droplet diameter, with reductions ranging from 20 to 30 mu m within the thermopressor due to increased flow turbulence and intense evaporation. The minimum achievable droplet diameter is as low as 15 mu m and accompanied by a notable increase in the fraction of small droplets (less than 25 mu m) to 40-60\%. Furthermore, the droplet distribution becomes more uniform, with the absence of large droplets exceeding 70 mu m in diameter. Increasing the water flow during injection has a positive impact on the number of smaller droplets, particularly those around 25 mu m, which is advantageous for contact cooling. The use of the thermopressor method for cooling cyclic air provides maximum protection to blade surfaces against drop-impact erosion, primarily due to the larger number of droplets with diameters below 25 mu m. These findings underline the potential of a properly configured thermopressor to improve the efficiency of contact cooling systems in gas turbines, resulting in improved performance and reliability in power generation applications. The hydrodynamic principles explored in this study may have wide applications in marine and stationary power plants based on gas and steam turbines, gas and internal combustion engines.

TI  - Omnidirectional Energy Harvesting Fleeces
AB  - Underwater mechanical energy harvesters are of risinginterestdue to their potential for various applications, such as self-poweredocean energy harvesters, monitoring devices, and wave sensors. Pressure-responsivefilms and stretch-responsive fibers, which provide high electricalpower in electrolytes and have simple structures that do not requirepacking systems, are promising as harvesters in the ocean environment.One drawback of underwater mechanical energy harvesters is that theyare highly dependent on the direction of receiving external forces,which is unfavorable in environments where the direction of the suppliedforce is constantly changing. Here, we report spherical fleece, consistingof wool fibers and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), whichexhibit repetitive electrical currents in all directions. No matterwhich direction the fleece is deformed, it changes the surface areaavailable for ions to access SWCNTs electrochemically, causing a piezoionicphenomenon. The current per input mechanical stress of the fabricatedSWCNT/wool energy harvester is up to 33.476 mA/MPa, which is the highestamong underwater mechanical energy harvesters reported to date. Inparticular, it is suitable for low-frequency (<1 Hz) environments,making it ideal for utilizing natural forces such as wind and wavesas harvesting sources. The operating mechanism in the nanoscale regionof the proposed fleece harvester has been theoretically elucidatedthrough all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.

TI  - Recording the Magnetic Field Produced by an Undersea Energy Generating Device: A Low-Cost Alternative
AB  - This work describes the characteristics of a device capable of detecting the magnetic field generated by a submerged electrical conductor. This low-cost apparatus is based on the open-source Arduino platform and offers the possibility of monitoring magnetic fields generated by undersea cables. Measuring magnetic fields generated by undersea cables facilitates the development of technologies that will harness marine energy potential. The research is based on published parameters of magnetic field values generated by existing submarine cables. A coil was built to simulate an approximate magnetic field at 10 mT. The magnetic field generated by the coil was used as a reference standard. The device developed has a measurement probe built with an array of SS49E Hall effect sensors placed in a straight line and separated 5 cm from each other. A DS18B20 temperature sensor was added to make the necessary corrections and cancel the influence of temperature during the measurements. A microSD card module was attached to store continuous magnetic field measurements. The device was adjusted under strict laboratory conditions. The functionality of the device developed was confirmed by two samplings in the sea. In these samples, the magnetic field generated by the coil was measured in the entire water column from a depth of 3 m to 150 m. Results indicate that the prototype can successfully perform the necessary functions to quantify the underwater magnetic field accurately with about 10 \& mu;T accuracy.

TI  - Offshore Fish Farms: A Review of Standards and Guidelines for Design and Analysis
AB  - While moving fish farms to offshore sites can be a more sustainable way to expand farmed fish production, the fish pens have to contend with a harsher environment. Thus, it is necessary to draw on offshore engineering competences for designing and analysing the offshore fish farming infrastructure. This paper reviews existing design and analysis guidance from maritime classification and national/international authorities that can be applicable for offshore fish farms. Based on the existing design guidelines, a review of design criteria for offshore fish farms under the following subtopics is provided: design life, design environmental loads, combining environmental loads, and miscellaneous load conditions. This review on the global performance analysis procedures and methods is presented based on practices used for neighbouring industries, such as offshore oil and gas and wind energy production, under the following subtopics: hydrostatic analysis, hydrodynamic analysis, and mooring system analysis with introducing theoretical background and modelling techniques. This paper also highlights limitations and cautions when using these design and analysis methods. Providing this comprehensive information, as well as commentary on their applications, will help engineers and designers to develop offshore fish farming infrastructure with confidence.

TI  - Effects of anthropogenic magnetic fields on the behavior of a major predator of the intertidal and subtidal zones, the velvet crab Necora puber
AB  - With the progress of the offshore renewable energy sector and electrical interconnection projects, a substantial rise in the number of submarine power cables is expected soon. Such cables emit either alternating or direct current magnetic fields whose impact on marine invertebrates is currently unknown and hardly studied. In this context, this study aimed to assess potential short-term exposure (30 min) effects of both alternating and direct magnetic fields of increasing intensity (72-304 \& mu;T) on the behavior of the high-ecological value velvet crab (Necora puber). Three experiments were designed to evaluate whether the strongest magnetic field intensities induce crabs' attraction or repulsion responses, and whether foraging and sheltering behaviors may be modified. We extracted from video analyses several variables as the time budgets crabs spent immobile, moving, feeding, or sheltering as well as total and maximal distance reached in the magnetic field (MF) gradient. The crabs exposed to artificial MF did not exhibit significant behavioral changes compared with those exposed to the ``natural{''} MF. Overall, our results suggest that, at such intensities, artificial magnetic fields do not significantly alter behaviors of N. puber. Nevertheless, future studies should be conducted to examine the effects of longer exposure periods and to detect potential habituation or resilience processes.

TI  - Design of the Organic Rankine Cycle for High-Efficiency Diesel Engines in Marine Applications
AB  - Over the past few years, fuel prices have increased dramatically, and emissions regulations have become stricter in maritime applications. In order to take these factors into consideration, improvements in fuel consumption have become a mandatory factor and a main task of research and development departments in this area. Internal combustion engines (ICEs) can exploit only about 15-40\% of chemical energy to produce work effectively, while most of the fuel energy is wasted through exhaust gases and coolant. Although there is a significant amount of wasted energy in thermal processes, the quality of that energy is low owing to its low temperature and provides limited potential for power generation consequently. Waste heat recovery (WHR) systems take advantage of the available waste heat for producing power by utilizing heat energy lost to the surroundings at no additional fuel costs. Among all available waste heat sources in the engine, exhaust gas is the most potent candidate for WHR due to its high level of exergy. Regarding WHR technologies, the well-known Rankine cycles are considered the most promising candidate for improving ICE thermal efficiency. This study is carried out for a six-cylinder marine diesel engine model operating with a WHR organic Rankine cycle (ORC) model that utilizes engine exhaust energy as input. Using expander inlet conditions in the ORC model, preliminary turbine design characteristics are calculated. For this mean-line model, a MATLAB code has been developed. In off-design expander analysis, performance maps are created for different speed and pressure ratios. Results are produced by integrating the polynomial correlations between all of these parameters into the ORC model. ORC efficiency varies in design and off-design conditions which are due to changes in expander input conditions and, consequently, net power output. In this study, ORC efficiency varies from a minimum of 6\% to a maximum of 12.7\%. ORC efficiency performance is also affected by certain variables such as the coolant flow rate, heat exchanger's performance etc. It is calculated that with the increase of coolant flow rate, ORC efficiency increases due to the higher turbine work output that is made possible, and the condensing pressure decreases. It is calculated that ORC can improve engine Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) from a minimum of 2.9\% to a maximum of 5.1\%, corresponding to different engine operating points. Thus, decreasing overall fuel consumption shows a positive effect on engine performance. It can also increase engine power output by up to 5.42\% if so required for applications where this may be deemed necessary and where an appropriate mechanical connection is made between the engine shaft and the expander shaft. The ORC analysis uses a bespoke expander design methodology and couples it to an ORC design architecture method to provide an important methodology for high-efficiency marine diesel engine systems that can extend well beyond the marine sector and into the broader ORC WHR field and are applicable to many industries (as detailed in the Introduction section of this paper).

TI  - Autonomous control of a prototype solar-powered offshore autonomous underwater vehicle servicing platform via a low-cost embedded architecture
AB  - This paper describes the design, implementation, and field-testing of a low-cost autonomous control system on the Platform for Expanding Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) exploRation to Longer ranges (PEARL). PEARL is a floating, solar-powered platform designed as a servicing station for AUVs. This paper describes the field testing of a prototype system currently without the ability to dock and recharge AUVs. In this prototype, autonomous operations are realized through the open-source MOOS-IvP marine robotics software running on an embedded architecture including a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, Arduino microcontroller, and onboard inertial measurement unit and GPS sensors. A solar charge controller monitors energy system statistics in real-time. Field tests included station-keeping and waypoint missions in a freshwater pond in Orleans, MA. An RMS tracking error of 0.9-2.2 m was achieved during waypoint pattern executions, with an average battery usage of 13\% per hour. Net power consumption rate will change due to variations in currents and winds, as well as variations in solar irradiance. The implementation of an autonomous sun-tracking mode to maximize solar panel flux while station-keeping is also evaluated. The field testing results will inform the design of a full-scale PEARL capable of docking with AUVs. This research helps pave the way for autonomous solar-powered service stations in the ocean that can connect the underwater world with space.

TI  - Solar-powered simultaneous highly efficient seawater desalination and highly specific target extraction with smart DNA hydrogels
AB  - Obtaining freshwater and important minerals from seawater with solar power facilitates the sustainable development of human society. Hydrogels have demonstrated great solar-powered water evaporation potential, but highly efficient and specific target extraction remains to be expanded. Here, we report the simultaneous highly efficient seawater desalination and specific extraction of uranium with smart DNA hydrogels. The DNA hydrogel greatly promoted the evaporation of water, with the water evaporation rate reached a high level of 3.54 kilograms per square meter per hour (1 kilowatt per square meter). Simultaneously, uranyl-specific DNA hydrogel exhibited a high capture capacity of 5.7 milligrams per gram for uranium from natural seawater due to the rapid ion transport driven by the solar powered interfacial evaporation and the high selectivity (10.4 times over vanadium). With programmable functions and easy-to-use devices, the system is expected to play a role in future seawater treatment.

TI  - Towards a Concept for Digitalized Yard Logistics-Outlining the Next-Generation Features
AB  - Yards are industrial sites for production and servicing of ships and offshore maritime installations, such as oil and gas platforms and modules, offshore windmills, and fish farms-all essential products in the maritime industry. Although many yards are performing highly complex and technically advanced production, there is still a need to bring the internal logistics of yards to a corresponding level of advancement. Industry 4.0 technologies may answer this need, and this paper presents a concept for digitalized yard logistics. The concept is developed through a concept development activity inspired by design science research, based on a multiple case study of 8 Norwegian yards, including shipyards and offshore construction yards. By mapping these yards, in particular their current level of digitalization, we propose a concept grounded in practice. The concept is built upon four main features of digitalized yard logistics: i) seamless, digitalized information flow, ii) identification and interconnectivity of objects, iii) digitalized operator support, and iv) automated and autonomous material flow. The paper describes and visualize how currently available digital technologies can be applied in the yard logistics context, to achieve those four main features. The concept may be used as inspiration for moving towards the next generation of yard logistics. The paper also addresses qualitatively the potential effects of digitalized yard logistics on yard logistics performance. In this way, the paper may serve as a starting point for more advanced and specific developments, as well as possible realizations, of digitalized yard logistics systems.

TI  - Environmental implications of offshore oil and gas decommissioning options: an eco-efficiency assessment approach
AB  - With the tremendous rise of aged offshore oil and gas (O&G) facilities, the world is on the horizon of a decommissioning dilemma. In addition to higher cost consumption, decommissioning offshore O&G platforms is an energy-intensive process and results in the production of huge waste on dry land. Few studies have been undertaken to assess and compare the environmental impacts of various decommissioning options, but economic barriers and data gaps have confronted the virtue of these studies. A holistic framework to assess the environmental and economic implications and identify the best decommissioning option is the need of the hour which can give clarity of selection to stakeholders of the offshore O&G decommissioning industry. This study aims to develop an eco-efficiency framework, by integrating environmental life cycle assessment and life cycle costing, to assess the environmental and economic impacts of the decommissioning process of offshore O&G platforms. A comparative study of four decommissioning options is carried out to determine the best decommissioning option for a specific offshore O&G platform. The study indicated that the use of vessels in the decommissioning process is the major contributor to the environmental impacts and costs. This framework helps the decision-makers to select cost-effective options which can reduce the environmental impacts and result in the reduction in resource exploitation.

TI  - POWER AUTOMATION ON A FLOATING PRODUCTION SYSTEM
AB  - One of the most critical aspects of power generation and distribution for an offshore production facility is reliability. Safety for those onboard the vessel and the ability to deliver maximum production are dependent on the availability of electrical power. Due to its critical nature, keeping power available should not be prone to delays or human errors, and thus requires an effective Power Management System (PMS) that is automated to control electrical equipment during real-time unexpected events. Power automation should be implemented in the PMS to maximize stability and availability, as well as to avoid any mis-operations or over-operations. Examples of this automation are fast power-based load shedding, automatic transformer and tie selection, automated restoration of the power system, and automated backup power transfer schemes. It is important to recognize that critical facility operations should only be enhanced by an integrated PMS and should not be dependent on such equipment. To this point, the Power System should still include the necessary hardwired interlocks to ensure the safety of personnel. Another important point regarding personnel safety is that the PMS allows for remote switching, using the graphical interface allows for reliable and common sense switching without the need for an individual to stand in front of the energized equipment. This paper will elaborate, using a real-world project, on how a power management system can automate the electrical system of an offshore platform to keep it safe, reliable, and stable.

TI  - Improvement in surface performance of stainless steel by nitride and carbon-based coatings prepared via physical vapor deposition for marine application
AB  - To meet the escalating energy demands, marine resources have assumed a significant role in the field of renewable energy. High performance and extended lifespan of offshore equipment provide robust underpinnings for marine resource exploration. Stainless steel, as one of the most widely used marine materials, its friction and corrosion problems in extreme marine environments have become critical factors influencing the service life of marine equipment. Physical vapor deposition (PVD) technology is a compelling method for current and future applications due to the advantages of simple process, no pollution, few consumables, and uniform film formation. The preparation of suitable strengthening coatings by PVD provides a promising approach for enhancing the surface properties of stainless steel. Here, we review the current status of research on the preparation of wear resistance and anti-corrosion coatings on stainless steel surfaces by PVD in marine environments. First, an overview of PVD technology is given. Second, the influence of nitride and carbon-based coatings prepared by PVD technology on the tribological and corrosion properties of stainless steel in the marine environment is discussed, and the strengthening mechanisms of the two coatings are compared and analyzed from the aspects of elemental doping and multilayer structure design. Finally, the challenges and future directions in the develop-ment of nitride and carbon-based coatings for marine environments are prospected. The goal is to propose the design ideas of a new generation of anti-wear and corrosion-resistant coatings.

TI  - PERFORMANCE FEASIBILITY OF A MULTI-SOURCE OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY PLATFORM FOR AQUACULTURE
AB  - The global aquaculture industry is facing new challenges as it strives to satisfy the continually growing demand for seafood products. The expanding industry brings with it challenges such as the diminishing availability of suitable coastal zones due to increased competition for marine-use areas, and a responsibility to limit negative impacts to the environment. As a potential solution to the negate environmental impact and continue industry expansion, operations are expected to transition further offshore. Moving aquaculture operations offshore presents several challenges, foremost of which is the provision of energy. This paper explores the feasibility of using a novel multi-source renewable energy platform to overcome the reliance on diesel in the offshore aquaculture industry. Through the development of a numerical model, this solution proposes a scalable renewable energy platform located off the coast of Tasmania utilising solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines and wave energy conversion. The feasibility is assessed through a numerical model based on factors such as resource availability, energy demand and conversion system efficiencies to determine how different design and resource variable influence the ability of the platform to meet the energy requirements.

TI  - An investment decision framework for offshore wind-solar-seawater pumped storage power project under interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy environment
AB  - Offshore wind-solar-seawater pumped storage (wind-PV-SPS) power system will be a very competitive offshore new energy project in the future because it can realize the complementarities of wind and photovoltaic resources in the dimensions of time and space, and reduce the waste of resources caused by voltage instability. In order to promote the sustainable development of offshore wind-PV-SPS system, it is particularly important to construct a scientific and reasonable investment decision-making framework. Firstly, a comprehensive criteria system is established in this paper, which includes economy, resource, environment, supporting conditions and market. Secondly, the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy set (IVPFS) is introduced to describe the uncertainty and fuzziness of information in the process of investment decision, and the expert weight correction model is established based on the similarity of IVPFSs. At the same time, IVPF-DEMATEL method is utilized to determine the weight of criteria, which takes the interaction between criteria into account. In addition, considering the decision-maker's risk preference psychology, we introduce the GOWUA-HARA operator into the PROMETHEE II method, and extend it to the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy environment to choose the optimal investment alternative. Finally, the proposed framework is applied to a case study. Then sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis are carried out to verify its feasibility and robustness.

TI  - Salinity gradient power using in the Black Sea regions (in frame of the blue growth development)
AB  - Problem Statement. Today, humanity is in search of new sources of energy to make the economy more sustainable, as well as the need for a transition to energy that works on the principles of Carbon-Free Technology. For the Black Sea, this is expressed in the desire for successful implementation of the program Blue Growth Accelerator, which is aimed at the introduction of innovative tech-nologies and alternative energy sources in the energy sector of the Black Sea countries, for the development of the ``Blue Economy{''} and the achievement of its healthy, productive and sustainable state. Salinity gradient power (SGP) is one of the new renewable energy sources. The most studied methods for obtaining SGP energy are technologies based on: Reverse Electrodialysis and Pressure Retarded Osmosis. The interaction of fresh and salt water can provide, in fact, unlimited, free and clean energy. The basis for the generation of such energy is the so-called salinity gradient that occurs when two types of water are mixed. After decades of work and numerous experiments, scientists have developed a way to use the energy of the salinity gradient to generate electricity. This type of electricity is also called ``Blue Energy{''} by association with the color of mixing freshwater and salt water when rivers flow into the ocean. Places (estuaries or deltas), where rivers flow into the oceans and seas, have a truly enormous energy potential. The aim of this study is to identify sites in the northwestern Black Sea region with the necessary conditions for the development of Salinity Gradient Power energy, as well as to assess their potential using the example of estimating the maximum theoretical power of the Pressure Retarded Osmosis process.Research Methodology. In a PRO system, the less concentrated solution flows towards the more concentrated solution due to the positive osmotic pressure difference as long as this difference remains greater than the hydrostatic pressure difference. It is by this principle that osmotic power is produced. Theoretically available amount of energy released when mixing 1 m3 of saturated brine (5 mol/l NaCl solution) and 1 m3 of sea water (0.5 mol/l NaCl) at 293 K is 10 MJ. In the northwestern Black Sea region, along the coast between the Danube and Dnieper rivers, there are 21 limans (lagoons) of which some can be used to generate of Salinity Gradient Power.Results. The results of calculating the maximum net power showed that highest values obtained in the summer months, when the salinity in limans reaches its maximum and, consequently, its difference with the salinity of sea (river) water increases. Proceeding from maximum net power, obtained for the Western Sivash, where the salinity is maintained artificially at certain values, it can be seen that the annual amplitude has a smaller value, which provides more stable conditions. There are objects in the northwestern Black Sea region, in the waters of which, as soon as technologies become available, it will be possible to implement SGP projects. The Kuialnyk Liman, Sasyk-Sivash lake and Western Sivash have the most favorable conditions, where the highest power indicators are shown when using the sea water - hypersaline solution scheme, in which freshwater is not consumed.

TI  - Performance assessment of buoyancy work energy storage system with various buoy materials, coatings, and gasses
AB  - This study investigates the performance of a buoyancy work energy storage system. The sought operational and efficiency enhancements were examined by coupling various permutations of buoy material, working gasses, buoy surface coatings, and applied loads. A plastic buoy and a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) float are used as they are common materials for buoy construction. Both buoys are filled with different gasses, namely air and helium and examined with and without a lubricating exterior silicon coating. The air and helium-filled PVC floats exhibited the best energy output performance across the different loads, whereas the original plastic buoy performed the poorest. The inclusion of the silicon coating on the external surface of the PVC floats resulted in an energy output performance enhancement of 15.44 \% and 5.01 \% for air and helium-filled PVC floats, respectively, and a 4 \% efficiency enhancement overall. However, the greater required input energy to descend (system charge) the silicon coated helium-filled PVC floats caused efficiency losses, with peak efficiency reaching 24.18 \%. However, the silicon coated air-filled PVC float reached a higher maximum of 29.61 \%. Moreover, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was carried out to investigate the system performance dependence on the presented variables. Consequently, a scaled-up version of the proposed buoyancy energy storage system was presented to be utilized in the London Array offshore wind turbine farm, with a LCOE of 0.978 Â¢/kWh.

TI  - A Study on Grid-Cell-Type Maritime Traffic Distribution Analysis Based on AIS Data for Establishing a Coastal Maritime Transportation Network
AB  - Recently, marine development plans such as offshore wind farms and marina port facilities have been established to use Korean coastal waters, and research on the development of operational ships such as autonomous ships and water-surface flying ships is being rapidly promoted. Since the marine traffic in Korean coastal waters is expected to increase, the government intends to construct a coastal maritime transportation network that connects Korean coastal waters to guarantee safe ship navigation. Therefore, this study used automatic-identification-system data analysis to obtain quantitative evaluation results on maritime traffic distribution characteristics and utilization levels for the entire Korean coastal waters in grid cell for greater consistency and compatibility. The characteristics of marine traffic distribution at a certain site in coastal Korean waters can be quantitatively examined using the findings of this study, and they may be used as grid-cell-type data-based information. Moreover, the vessel traffic index allows for extensive research while quickly understanding the present level of use of the passing ships by the sea area. In this regard, the findings of this study are expected to be useful for the future development of maritime transportation networks in Korean coastal waters.

TI  - Effects of compressive damage on the corrosion protection performance of offshore wind power coating systems
AB  - Damage to multilayer organic coating systems due to compressive loads can deteriorate the corrosion protection performance of the coatings under offshore exposure. The contribution is concerned with statistical investigations into the effects of load-based and coating-based factors on the protection performance of different coating systems. Accelerated cyclic laboratory tests (ISO 12944-9) were performed on four multilayer coating systems, and the results were statistically analyzed. Results of analysis of variance investigations revealed that the effects on the anticorrosive performance of the coatings (anticorrosive effect {[}AE]) were dominated by coating-based factors, namely coating system and total dry film thickness. These factors could explain 86\% of all effects. Coating system was the only extremely significant factor. Load-based factors did not deliver notable effects (5\%). Except for the contact stiffness, these factors were insignificant. The load intensity was insignificant for all target parameters (blistering, delamination, AE). Coating regions, plastically deformed during the compression tests, did not lead to a reduction in the protection performance. Statistical investigations revealed that effects on the anticorrosive performance of compressively damaged multilayer organic coatings were dominated by coating-based factors. Except for the contact stiffness, load-based factors were insignificant. Coating regions, plastically deformed during compression, did not lead to a reduction in the protection performance.image

TI  - Using Multi-Criteria Decision Making in Quality Function Deployment for Offshore Renewable Energies
AB  - Quality function deployment (QFD) is now used in various fields, such as product development, design, manufacturing, planning, and quality management services, as a planning tool to achieve customer requirements and needs while improving performance and sustainability concerns. This paper presents a systematic literature review of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodologies integrated into QFD over the last year. In 2022, 56 research papers on planning strategies, the supply chain, and product development using QFD were published. Other fields such as energy, academia, and environment have also shown considerable interest in the integration of MCDM methodologies in QFD to improve decision-making processes. This research shows that the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS) methodologies are mainly used to rank customer requirements and weigh their importance in the house of quality (HoQ) structure. The use of fuzzy logic has been incorporated into the correlation matrix to evaluate the relationships between customer requirements and technical requirements. Methodologies such as decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and fuzzy cognitive maps are implemented to deal with contradictions, and they have also been used to rank engineering characteristics. In the field of energy and renewable technologies, only few studies related to the integration of MCDM methodologies in QFD were found, but it is forecasted that their use will be used more often as they offer improvements and benefits in the ocean energy sector.

TI  - Design concepts of hydrogen supply chain to bring consumers offshore green hydrogen
AB  - This study presents design concepts for hydrogen supply chains as a way to investigate how to transport green hydrogen from offshore sites to onshore sites where it would be available to consumers. The six concepts suggested are based on compressed hydrogen, a pipeline, liquefied hydrogen, liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC), ammonia, and a subsea cable. Most of the concepts transported the hydrogen from production to con-sumption sites, but in the case of the subsea cable transferred electricity from the offshore wind farm. All the design concept were created to satisfy the same specific case study. For this case study, the East Sea was selected as the hydrogen production site, Busan port was chosen as the hydrogen consumption site. The six concepts were applied to the suggested case study before being compared from the viewpoint of each system's complexity. The results show that the pipeline-and subsea cable-based hydrogen supply chains are rela-tively simple relative to the other concepts, the LOHC-and ammonia-based hydrogen supply chains are inherently more complex because they require de-hydrogenation and cracking processes to extract hydrogen from the LOHC and ammonia. On the other hand, ammonia and liquefied hydrogen have advantages in terms of ship transportation because they both provide high volumetric densities. In the case of ammonia, the infrastructure required would be significantly reduced if it could be directly used as a fuel without the cracking and purification processes. This study proposes and compares various hydrogen supply chain concepts with the goal that the results will prove helpful to those attempting to create an offshore hydrogen supply chain by providing fundamental data to decision -makers in the early design stages.

TI  - Multi-Objective Decision-Making for an Island Microgrid in the Gulf of Maine
AB  - Microgrid implementation often lacks economic and environmental efficiencies due to sub-optimal configuration and operation. The current study aims to explore the optimal configuration and operational strategies for a microgrid system with maximum life cycle economic and environmental co-benefits. This study was inspired by a real microgrid optimization need for Shoals Marine Laboratory, a seasonal marine teaching and research field station on Appledore Island, Maine. A system dynamic model was developed to simulate the microgrid operation, and a multi-criteria analysis was performed based on diesel electricity generation, equivalent annual costs, and carbon footprint under various system sizing and operation scenarios. This study found that an effective battery capacity of 120-165 kWh (400-550 kWh actual with 30\% depth of discharge) and a solar capacity of 85-105 kW can effectively minimize all three objectives under an average daily demand of 265 kWh during the study period. Additionally, implementing an alternative system operation strategy can lead to a 12\% reduction in diesel electricity generation.

TI  - Projected Reductions in CO2 Emissions by Using Alternative Methanol Fuel to Power a Service Operation Vessel
AB  - Due to increasingly stringent IMO and European Commission requirements for greenhouse gas emissions, the present study analysed the projected reductions in CO2 emissions achieved by using methanol as an alternative fuel to power custom service operation vessels (SOVs) serving wind platforms in the Baltic Sea. Methanol is a relatively new fuel, approved for use as a safe marine fuel in the late 2020s. In these analyses, reference was made to the current interim guidelines, supplementing the IGF Code in the form of MSC.1/Circ.1621. The SOV type was chosen because of the current growing demand for these ships (the dynamic development of offshore wind power) and the lack of analyses of this type of small craft. The importance of assessing CO2 emissions in this case is due to the specifics of the vesselâ€™s operation in different modes, and thus the variable load on the propulsion system and the area of operation close to the coastline. A computational research method was used to evaluate CO2 emissions, as well as the cost of methanol fuel, using current regulations and technical data. A comparison was also made between conventional MDO and LNG fuels. The first results of the analysis showed that methanol fuel is only competitive with MDO (a few-percent advantage) in terms of the average estimated index value EIV. Economically, it will require a higher investment, despite the favourable unit price of methanol compared to LNG and MDO. Â© 2023 by the author.

TI  - The Practice and Development of T-Bar Penetrometer Tests in Offshore Engineering Investigation: A Comprehensive Review
AB  - In recent years, the development of marine hydrocarbon resources has led to an increased demand for research on the marine soil bearing capacity and cyclic loading effect in marine engineering design. Because of the difficulties and high costs involved in obtaining high-quality soil samples from offshore sites, in situ testing techniques have become the preferred method of determining design parameters in offshore geotechnical engineering projects. This paper provides a review of the current state of marine penetrometer deployment technology used in offshore engineering investigations and presents a summary of the T-bar penetrometer test for measuring marine soft clay. The existing literature research on penetration mechanisms, numerical simulations, laboratory experiments, and field tests of the T-bar penetrometer in the field of marine geotechnical engineering are analyzed. Finally, the potential difficulties, challenges, and prospects of the T-bar penetrometer tests are discussed.

TI  - Use of high salinity water in a power plant by connecting a direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) to a steam-injected gas turbine (STIG)
AB  - Unlike steam turbines, electricity production in gas turbines is inherently independent of freshwater consumption. However, the thermal efficiency of gas turbines decreases as the temperature of input air increases. As a result, many methods of cooling the inlet air require the use of fresh water. Moreover, when it comes to humid gas turbine technology, the practice of injecting steam or humid air into the turbine to improve its thermal efficiency and output power consumes a substantial amount of freshwater. Therefore, reducing the use of fresh water to enhance the output power and thermal efficiency of gas turbines can be a necessary option, especially in hot and dry regions. Alternatively, considering the significant amounts of waste heat in gas turbines, one solution to reduce fresh water consumption is to connect them to thermal desalination units. However, conventional thermal desalination is only practical for seawater desalination in coastal areas. Therefore, this study explores the possibility of linking a direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) unit to a Steam-injected gas turbine (STIG), which can use high salinity water sources like reverse osmosis (RO) brine in inland regions. The freshwater generated by the DCMD is used to chill the input air to the compressor and produce steam injected within the turbine. Simulation results show that this connection can raise the net output power by {[}9 to 17.2] MW and thermal efficiency by {[}3.3 to 15.6] \% for compressor pressure ratios between {[}5 to 30], when compared to a simple gas turbine.

TI  - Optimal Energy Storage System and Smart Switch Placement in Dynamic Microgrids With Applications to Marine Energy Integration
AB  - This paper studies a dynamic microgrid (DMG) planning problem that places energy storage systems (ESSs) and smart switches (SSWs) optimally in the system. We apply the proposed methodology to applications concerning marine renewable energy (MRE). MRE is an emerging clean energy resource with enormous capacity but volatile and intermittent energy output profiles. Innovative grid-integration technologies designed to enhance the reliability of an MRE-integrated system are needed. However, there are still limited studies in this regard. Existing works have shown the promising prospect of using a dynamic microgrid (DMG) operational concept to accommodate renewable resources in distribution systems, but they usually assume fixed ESS and SSW installations. To further improve the operational flexibility of DMGs, we propose a DMG planning methodology that optimally places ESSs and SSWs so that a DMG with MRE is warranted with proper resource adequacy and topological flexibility in both the contingency and normal operations. We use realistic case studies based on a real-world distribution network and the U.S. Department of Energy's MRE dataset to verify the value and validity of the proposed work.

TI  - Review of Offshore Chemical Flooding Field Applications and Key Lessons Learned
AB  - This paper presents an overview of both current advancements and field applications of offshore chemical flooding technologies. Along with offshore oilfield development strategies that require the maximization of oil production in a short development cycle, chemical flooding can become a potential avenue to accelerate oil production in secondary oil recovery mode. This makes it different from onshore chemical flooding processes that mostly focus on enhanced oil recovery in mature or maturing reservoirs. The advancements in offshore chemical flooding field applications are reviewed and analyzed. By summarizing offshore application cases, the presented analysis also assesses the chemical formulations applied or studied and injection/production facilities required in offshore environments. The main technical challenges are also discussed for scaling up the applications on offshore platforms or floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) systems. The chemical flooding technologies reviewed include polymer flooding, surfactant-polymer (SP) flooding, and alkaline-surfactant- polymer (ASP) flooding. By assessing the technology readiness level of these technologies, this study presents their perspectives and practical relevance for offshore chemical flooding applications. It has been long realized that chemical flooding, especially polymer flooding, can improve oil recovery in offshore oil fields. The applications in Bohai Bay (China), Dalia (Angola), and Captain (North Sea) provide the know-how workflows for offshore polymer flooding from laboratory to full-field applications. It is feasible to implement offshore polymer injection either on a platform or in an FPSO system. It is recommended to implement polymer flooding at an early stage of reservoir development to maximize the investment in offshore facilities. By tuning the chemistry of polymer products, they can present very good compatibility with seawaters. Therefore, choosing a proper polymer is no longer a big issue for offshore polymer flooding. There are also some interesting findings reported on the development of novel surfactant chemistries for offshore applications. The outcome from a number of small-scale trials, including the single-well chemical tracer tests on surfactant, alkaline-surfactant (AS), and SP in offshore Malaysia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and South China Sea, provided valuable insights for the feasibility of chemical flooding in offshore environments. However, the technology readiness levels of surfactant-based chemical flooding processes are still low, partially due to their complex interactions with subsurface fluids and the lack of interest in producing residual oil from matured offshore reservoirs. Based on the lessons learned from offshore applications, it can be concluded that several major challenges still need to be overcome in terms of large well spacing, reservoir voidage, produced fluid treatment, and high operational expense to successfully scale up surfactant-based chemical flooding processes for offshore applications.

TI  - Ships without crews: IMO and UK responses to cybersecurity, technology, law and regulation of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS)
AB  - This article considers the current technological developments in uncrewed Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS), examines the legal and regulatory challenges that they raise, and describes the ways in which an international body (the International Maritime Organization, IMO) and a national agency (UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency, MCA) are engaging with the massive task of regulating this new development in shipping. To achieve the research aim, the article combines primary data from interviews with industry, government and international regulators, a survey completed by practitioners, experts and academics working in the field, and relevant secondary sources. The article makes an original contribution by noting and analyzing the approaches of the IMO and the UK government-bodies which are highly influential in shaping global attitudes, preparation, adoption and responses to such innovative technologies like MASS-and how they have engaged with the difficult question of regulating the various legal, technical and cybersecurity challenges that they raise. It concludes that for the MASS technology to fulfill its potential and gradually see the integration of such vessels in international shipping in a safe, secure and sustainable way, the international community needs to work together, and update by consensus the key legal instruments and policy documents. In this major task, the UK approach and IMO's leading role can play a protagonist role in developing best practice and implementing respectively.

TI  - Aquaculture in an Offshore Ship: An On-Site Test of Large Yellow Croaker (Larimichthys crocea)
AB  - Ship aquaculture platforms are expected to become a meaningful way to expand offshore farming. The growth performance and nutritional composition of the large yellow croaker reared in an offshore ship aquaculture system and nearshore traditional cage system was evaluated in this study. The results showed that the aquaculture ship could effectively avoid the harsh environment such as typhoons and red tides. The test large yellow croaker adapted to the ship culture system in a short time. No serious stress events occurred during the whole rearing process. During the culture experimental period, the fish fed normally, and disease was controlled. The aquaculture ship has good environment conditions during breeding with a water temperature of 21.5-28.5 degrees C, salinity 20.7-31.8 parts per thousand, pH 7.6-8.4, dissolved oxygen 7.2-12.8 mg/L, ammonia nitrogen < 0.08 mg/L, and the number of bacteria and vibrio in water were 1.2 {*} 10(3)-1.6 {*} 10(3) CFU/mL and 1.2 {* 10(2)-1.8 {*} 10(2) CFU/mL, respectively. The survival, weight gain rate, and monthly weight gain of the large yellow croaker in the ship were 99.02\%, 41.48\%, and 67.52 g, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of cage culture. The crude protein content of the large yellow croaker raised in the ship was significantly higher than that in the cage group, and the crude fat content was significantly lower than that in the cage group. These results indicated that the growth performance and nutritional composition of the large yellow croaker reared in offshore ship were better than those of the fish in the cage. These findings enhanced our understanding of an offshore ship aquaculture model of large yellow croaker.

TI  - Meta-analysis of the thermal pollution caused by coastal nuclear power plants and its effects on marine biodiversity
AB  - The rise in seawater temperature due to industrial activities is one of the main threats to marine biodiversity. In nuclear power plants, large volumes of water are used for their operation, returning to the ecosystem at higher temperatures. A global meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the thermal effects caused by coastal nuclear power plants on marine organisms. We found 853 articles of which, 99 were included in the qualitative analysis and 75 in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed an increase of 4.38 degrees C in water temperature near the outfall, and the temperature variation of each study was found to be associated with the power plant latitudes. The main effects on organisms were related to changes in the structure and composition of aquatic communities, with species abundance, distribution, dominance, and density being the most cited ones. Among the affected groups, photosynthesizing microorganisms were the most cited, potentially contributing to shifts in ecosystem dynamics.

TI  - Repair and strengthening of offshore platforms topside girders using externally bonded fibre reinforced polymers
AB  - Offshore structures play an important role in the current economy, from oil and gas to facilitating offshore renewable energies. It is inevitable that steel structures residing in an offshore environment will corrode over time due to salt accumulation. Such structures, often utilizing plate girders as structural members, frequently require repair to operate safely and efficiently. The conventional method of repair involves entire sections being replaced and welded underwater. This method has proven to be a costly approach due to the operational losses of a shutdown during repair. In this study, the practicability of an alternative repair method using fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites along with an associated adhesive is investigated. Various studies have been con-ducted on this topic, however this project aims to fill the gaps in the understanding of FRP repaired steel beams which have been stiffened with transverse web stiffeners located at loading points. This is a very applicable scenario to the offshore industry and prevents supporting beams from undergoing lateral torsional buckling. Three compact plate girders are tested under four-point bending; an intact section, a damaged section and a damaged section repaired with FRP. Testing was undertaken on the Amsler machine in the UWA Structures Laboratory. For the purpose of this study, corrosion is imitated through cutting a section of web and both flanges in the midspan. A strength regain ratio (SRR) is utilised to compare the extent of capacity regained through repair.

TI  - Ship carbon dioxide emission estimation in coastal domestic emission control areas using high spatial-temporal resolution data: A China case
AB  - It is necessary to accurately calculate ship carbon emissions for shipping suitability. The state-of-the-art ap-proaches could arguably not be able to estimate ship carbon emissions accurately due to the uncertainties of Ship Technical Specification Database (STSD) and the geographical and temporal breakpoints in Automatic Identi-fication System (AIS) data, hence requiring a new methodology to be developed to address such defects and further improve the accuracy of emission estimation. Firstly, a novel STSD iterative repair model is proposed based on the random forest algorithm by the incorporation of13 ship technical parameters. The repair model is scalable and can substantially improve the quality of STSD. Secondly, a new ship AIS trajectory segmentation algorithm based on ST-DBSCAN is developed, which effectively eliminates the impact of geographical and temporal AIS breakpoints on emission estimation. It can accurately identify the ships' berthing and anchoring trajectories and reasonably segment the trajectories. Finally, based on this proposed framework, the ship carbon dioxide emissions within the scope of domestic emission control areas (DECA) along the coast of China are estimated. The experiment results indicate that the proposed STSD repair model is highly credible due to the significant connections between ship technical parameters. In addition, the emission analysis shows that, within the scope of China's DECA, the berthing period of ships is longer owing to the joint effects of coastal operation features and the strict quarantine measures under the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlights the emissions produced by ship auxiliary engines and boilers. The carbon intensity of most coastal provinces in China is relatively high, reflecting the urgent demand for the transformation and updates of the economic development models. Based on the theoretical models and results, this study recommends a five-stage decarbonization scheme for China's DECA to advance its decarbonization process.

TI  - Synbiotics and aquamimicry as alternative microbial-based approaches in intensive shrimp farming and biofloc: Novel disruptive techniques or complementary management tools? A scientific-based overview
AB  - Globally, aquaculture, especially shrimp farming, plays an important economic role. However, it is known that traditional shrimp farming could negatively create environment impacts (e.g. due to water discharge into coastal areas and marine habitats), if good management practices are not followed. For these problems to be minimized, the industry needs to develop and implement technologies that promote sustainable aquaculture. Among different techniques, the biofloc technology (BFT) system and, more recently, the synbiotics and aquamimicry are considered alternatives microbial-based approaches that address high yields with certain level of biosecurity and better environmental practices. However, different from biofloc, both aquamimicry and synbiotics use fer-mented carbon sources in their routine practices. The present article aims to bring (i) the current status and research and development (R\&D) efforts, (ii) the basics principles around synbiotics and aquamimicry; (iii) compares their key characteristics and (iv) discuss whether these two systems would be considered novel disruptive techniques or more likely management tools. The manuscript evidenced both systems share several operational and microbial similarities, and operate under comparable conditions. Recent bibliometric analysis (Web of Science) showed 578 articles for BFT, and only 20 for synbiotics and 3 for aquamimicry, an evident lack of scientific background highlighting that more science-based R\&D efforts are needed in synbiotics and aquamimicry.

TI  - Alternative Gaseous Fuels for Marine Vessels towards Zero-Carbon Emissions
AB  - The maritime industry is recognized as a major pollution source to the environment. The use of low- or zero-carbon marine alternative fuel is a promising measure to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and toxic pollutants, leading to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Hydrogen (H2), fuel cells particularly proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), and ammonia (NH3) are screened out to be the feasible marine gaseous alternative fuels. Green hydrogen can reduce the highest carbon emission, which might amount to 100% among those 5 types of hydrogen. The main hurdles to the development of H2 as a marine alternative fuel include its robust and energy-consuming cryogenic storage system, highly explosive characteristics, economic transportation issues, etc. It is anticipated that fossil fuel used for 35% of vehicles such as marine vessels, automobiles, or airplanes will be replaced with hydrogen fuel in Europe by 2040. Combustible NH3 can be either burned directly or blended with H2 or CH4 to form fuel mixtures. In addition, ammonia is an excellent H2 carrier to facilitate its production, storage, transportation, and usage. The replacement of promising alternative fuels can move the marine industry toward decarbonization emissions by 2050. Â© 2023 by the authors.

TI  - Response to Gallagher (2022)â€”the Australian Tidal Restoration for Blue Carbon method 2022â€”conservative, robust, and practical
AB  - The Blue Carbon Accounting Model (BlueCAM) is a tool for tidal restoration projects established under the Tidal Restoration for Blue Carbon method (2022) of the Australian voluntary carbon market. The commentary of Gallagher discussed that BlueCAM did not subtract allochthonous carbon, which is carbon in wetland soils from external sources, either terrestrial or marine sources, from estimated net abatement. This approach was used because all organic carbon preserved in a restored wetland soil, irrespective of its source, is deposited because the wetland was restored, and thus all carbon preserved above the baseline is â€œadditional.â€ As restoration projects develop, further characterization of different soil carbon fractions as suggested by Gallagher may improve BlueCAM. BlueCAM is transparent, conservative, and importantly is feasible for implementation, as well as being consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the Australian legislative offsets integrity standards.

TI  - Modern development of ship wind systems within the new rating of Top-7 projects
AB  - The problem of decarbonization of human activity is one of the most important in the conditions of the ever-increasing threat of global warming. It is solved differently in all areas of modern society, primarily in the fields of engineering and technology. The transport fleet could not be aloof from solving this problem, as it consumes about 6% of the total volume of oil fuel, and the share of greenhouse gases generated during its combustion in shipâ€™s internal combustion engines (ICE) is â‰ˆ 3% of their total amount. Therefore, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in Appendix VI of the Convention â€MARPOL 73/78â€ introduced restrictions on emissions of harmful substances by sea transport. Among the main technical ways to reduce them, the IMO recommends the use of wind and solar energy. Since solar energy systems have small specific power, it is unable to replace shipâ€™s ICE. Sailing energy was the main energy on the weasels 150 years ago, so it is potentially able to replace ship diesel engines. A new revival of sailboats began in the 60s of the XX century. At the same time, it is important to choose the right ways and the best options for sailing systems, which allows you to avoid wasting time and money on the development of unproductive options. Therefore, the selection of the TOP-7 best options is an urgent and important task and constitutes the main goal of the work being performed. Its scientific novelty is the substantiation of the best options for modern ships sailing systems and ways of their evolution for the development of recommendations for their design and use. Research methods are based on the comparison of technical and economic indicators of the best ship wind systems of world. Work results. In 2019, Captain Paul Watson highlighted the TOP-7 projects of ship wind systems. In 2022, based on criticism of its shortcomings, a new TOP-7 rating was developed. Its further justification based on the development of new projects of ship wind systems in recent years is given in this work. Conclusions. Modern projects of ship wind systems and their development paths confirm the validity of the new TOP-7 rating, therefore it is recommended for further research and development of ship wind systems.

TI  - Estimation of aboveground biomass of mangrove forest using UAV-LiDAR
AB  - As one of the vegetation types with the highest carbon storage in tropical regions, the area of mangrove forest shows a trend of fragmentation and reduction. The spatial distribution and dynamic information of mangrove biomass are crucial to the estimation of greenhouse gas flux and carbon storage, as well as policy formulation and implementation. However, both optical data and SAR data commonly used for biomass estimation have signal saturation phenomenon, and traditional estimation algorithms for mangrove biomass estimation have high data requirements and relatively low estimation accuracy. In order to solve this problem, this study compared the accuracy of four gradient enhanced decision tree algorithms for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) of invasive mangrove species Sonneria apetala used UAV-LiDAR data, and discussed the importance of variables in the modeling process. The results indicate that: (1) XGBR had a high fitting ability for the estimation of mangrove AGB, reaching R2=0.833 8, RMSE=1.55 Mg/hm2. (2) The predicted AGB in the study area ranged from 73.10 Mg/hm2 to 190.00 Mg/hm2, with an average of 109.10 Mg/hm2. (3) LiDAR index describing canopy height characteristics is an important variable for estimating mangrove AGB. Conclusion: This study proved the feasibility of UAV-LiDAR data and XGBR model for estimating the AGB of mangrove forests, in order to provide data support for the blue carbon research of mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Blue carbon stock of aquasilviculture-based agroforestry system in Infanta, Quezon, Philippines
AB  - Blue carbon stock of the four aquasilviculture (AQS) systems within a Community-based Mangrove Forest Management area in Infanta, Quezon was assessed. Results demonstrated that the aboveground biomass and root carbon stock of the four AQS differed significantly (p<0.05). AQS 4, adopted the peripheral/separate model type of AQS and dominated by Rhizophora sp., possessed significantly greater aboveground C stock (101.12 Mg ha-1) and root C stock (48.05 Mg ha-1). While the Aegiceras sp.-dominated AQS 3, which adopted the mixed model type, and with semi-intensive grow-out polyculture, had the highest total C sediment stock at 1,023 Mg ha-1. Overall, AQS 4 had the highest total carbon stock, calculated at 1,141.47 Mg ha-1. A large portion of the C stock potential of each AQS is derived from the sediment carbon pool which accounted for up to 87.5% of the total C pool, according to the results. Findings indicated that AQS contributes a substantial amount of total carbon stock comparable to that of a pure mangrove ecosystem. If valued, the blue carbon stock of the aquasilviculture systems ranged between Php 901,491.86 (USD 16,510.84) and Php 983,540.38 (USD 18,013.56). This can provide the People's Organization with additional income in addition to the income generated from their cultivation of aquatic species. Therefore, aquasilviculture system is a good climate mitigation strategy with socio-economic advantages. Â© 2023 Association of Agricultural Technology in Southeast Asia. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mangrove restoration built soil organic carbon stocks over six decades: a chronosequence study
AB  - Purpose: Mangrove restoration has been suggested to have a great potential for global change mitigation due to the large carbon sequestration capacity of mangroves. However, the temporal and spatial dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage following mangrove restoration remains less examined and reported. To fill the knowledge gap, this study examined the SOC stocks and soil physicochemical properties among bare mudflats and adjacent mangroves at different stand ages. Methods: We collected soil cores from bare mudflats and adjacent 7-, 10-, 15-, and 60-year-old mangroves on Ximen Island, Zhejiang Province, China. SOC, pH, salinity, particle size, and dry bulk density were determined. The analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences in above parameters among mangroves with different ages and mudflats. Pearsonâ€™s correlation was conducted to assess the relationship of SOC contents and other soil physicochemical properties. Results: Our results showed that SOC stock increased exponentially following restoration, reaching an asymptotic trend after 15-year mangrove restoration. The 60-year-old mangrove forests had significantly higher SOC stocks (94.31 Â± 4.99Â Mg OC haâˆ’1) compared to the unvegetated mudflat (76.25 Â± 1.65Â Mg SOC haâˆ’1) and the 7-year-old transplanted sites (79.04 Â± 5.30Â Mg OC haâˆ’1). Soil salinity, pH, and bulk density increased significantly within the whole depth, except decreasing trend of salinity in lower depth (> 25Â cm). Soil texture was finer in mudflats and early stages of mangrove plantations than that in other sites. Conclusion: This study indicated that mangrove transplantation can substantially enhance SOC stocks within 15Â years after afforestation. These results provide key data on the effectiveness of mangrove afforestation on carbon sequestration to inform blue carbon policies.

TI  - Investigations of the thermodynamic efficiency limits of a novel subsea energy storage concept
AB  - In light of the energy transition and the need to reduce emissions, efficient and capable energy storage devices are needed. Different concepts will have their individual pros and cons, an energy storage device placed subsea would provide high energy densities, long lifetime, and high efficiencies given that the unit could be designed so that it takes advantage of the cooling effects of the ocean. To fully evaluate a conceptual subsea energy storage device based on PHS (Pumped Hydro Storage), the theoretical efficiency limits were derived. Although several different subsea PHS concepts have been presented in various papers, a study outlining the basic thermodynamic limits has not been widely published, the intention of this paper is to fill this gap. Different standard thermodynamic cycles such as the Otto and Joule cycles have been analyzed. The best possible efficiency for an adiabatic process is achieved by compressing/expanding the gas in a combined Otto-Joule cycle which for a compression ratio of 50 would give a maximum possible efficiency of 93.2%. If enough time for heat transfer is given during the compression/expansion process an isothermal process would be achievable which would result in an isothermal process with a theoretical efficiency of 100%. It is interesting to note the difference between CAES (Compressed Air Energy Storage) and the subsea-PHS where in the former case the energy that is utilized is the expansion energy of the gas and for the PHS system the energy of the water flowing into the tank is the energy that is converted into electrical power where the compression energy of the gas reduces the available energy. The main criteria for the ideal cycle are low compression energy and high expansion energy. In addition, the heat generated in the compression process is not utilized so a very slow compression process where there are no finite heat transfers and thus very small entropy generation is desired. If a slow process is not possible, the entropy generation could be lowered by splitting the compression process into smaller steps. A case where an adiabatic compression process is split into several steps was investigated and it was found that splitting an adiabatic compression process into two steps with enough time for heat transfer in between would lower the amount of compression energy needed by 15% for an adiabatic case with a compression ratio of 100. The theoretical study provided in this paper will form the basis for detailed parameter studies and subsequent publications. Â© 2022

TI  - Application of Nanotechnology in Bioenergy Production from Algae and Cyanobacteria
AB  - Energy impacts significantly the sustainable â€œsocio-economic developmentâ€ of a country. At present, more than half the energy of any country is derived from non-renewable fossil fuels releasing excess of hydrocarbons, NOx, and SOx into the environment. Biofuels derived from algae/cyanobacterial feedstock are quite promising owing to their high growth rate compared to higher plants, large accumulation of required macromolecules like lipids, carbohydrates, proteins of their dry weights (often >50%), carbon sequestration, low emission of pollutants, and ease of cultivation (waste water, sea water, barren land) in open/closed photo bioreactors. Also, many value-added products like nutraceuticals, food, feed, pig ments, cosmetics, antimicrobials, and biolubricants can be derived in an algal/cyanobacterial energy industry through biorefinery approach. Although transesteri fication (biodiesel), fermentation (bioalcohol), pyrolysis (biocrude/biochar/syngas), anaerobic digestion (biogas), and hydrothermal liquefaction (biocrude) are the pro cesses used for bioenergy production, often the product yield is low in such conven tional processes with more waste generation requiring disposal. Intervention of relatively new nanotechnology would be useful for efficiency in processing, product generation, and minimizing the wastes generated in a conventional industrial pro cess. Green synthesis of nanoparticles mediated by algae/cyanobacteria, namely, Oscillatoria willei NTDM01, Spirulina platensis, Coelastrella sp., Phormidium tenue, Prasiola crispa, and Lemanea manipurensis is on record. Besides being use ful as catalyst, nanoparticles are readily dispersible due to their small size with higher surface to volume ratio, catalytic efficiency, and recyclability. A few algae/cyanobacteria are tested through nanotechnological intervention for effective pro duction of biofuels, e.g., Chlorella vulgaris, C. salina, C. pyrenoidosa, Nannochloropsis sp., Ulva prolifera, Isochrysis sp.. The nanoparticles of gold (Au), silver (Ag), palladium (Pd), copper (Cu), zerovalent iron (ZVI), magnetite (Fe3O4), titanium (Ti), nickel oxide (NiO), calcium oxide (CaO), and silica (SiO2) have been documented for bioenergy production. Therefore, it is worthwhile to study the nanotechnology applied in an algal/cyanobacterial biorefinery along with the physicochemical characterization to enhance its cost-effectiveness, yield, and sustainability. The safety aspects of nanoparticles due to their persistency in environment and future prospects are emphasized. Â© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

TI  - Energy reduction actions to meet International Maritime Organisation (IMO) 2030 and impacts from introduction of electrical systems changes and considerations for power quality and harmonics.
AB  - This paper will look at the steps towards a greener future for the shipping industry, including grey ships, commercial vessels and ports, and why the IMO 2030 and 2050 targets have been established. As operators of maritime platforms and port facilities move to meet lower emission standards, required by IMO2030, a number of solutions are being implemented or considered to meet these targets. The IMO initial strategy for reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is challenging ships and port operators alike and it is these end users who need to find, develop and integrate more energy-efficient solutions to meet GHG targets for both 2030 and 2050 targets These solutions include the greater use of LED technology to reduce lighting loads as well as the increased use of Variable Frequency Drives (WD) and variable speed drives (VSD) to reduce motor loads on-board vessels. Port facilities likewise are building additional electrical power systems to allow for increased use of shore connections and HV cold ironing facilities for IEP vessels. This presentation will identify some of the concerns that operators need to be aware of when implementing energy reduction solutions using WD's, LED's etc. and for operators with solutions already in place-how do they meet the requirements imposed by class societies such as LR, DNV etc.To keep Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) under control and meeting practical applications on vessels.

TI  - OPTIMAL DESIGN AND OPERATION OF LOW-HEAD OFFSHORE PUMPED HYDRO ENERGY STORAGE FOR THE PROVISION OF MARKET-BASED GRID SERVICES
AB  - According to the â€œEuropean Green Dealâ€, Europe should be climate neutral through the reduction in greenhouse gas emission and primary energy source use by 2050. Thus, one key aspect is the increased deployment of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy for power supply. However, the massive incorporation of variable renewable energies can lead to instabilities of the grid due to different reasons, for example uncertainties in prognosis, reduction of the share of synchronous generation. Low-head pumped hydro energy storages (LH-PHES) can be designed to stabilize the electric grid in lowland countries by the provision of grid balancing services. Therefore, simulations are conducted in this study to investigate the viability of providing Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR) and Automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve (aFRR) with a LH-PHES. The study is based on the European grid and energy market data from 2021. The results clearly demonstrate the general feasibility of FCR and aFRR provision from an offshore LH-PHES. The provision of aFRR results in a significantly higher profit compared to the provision of FCR for an equal balancing capacity. However, the provision of aFRR would require a greater water volume than the provision of FCR. In general, a smaller reservoir would require a smaller overall facility and thus, less investment costs. Therefore, the FCR provision by a smaller LH-PHES can also be a viable solution for grid balancing services. Â© The Institution of Engineering & Technology 2023.

TI  - Methane Recovery with Carbon Dioxide Sequestration as Hydrates in Deep Marine Environments: An Extensive Examination of Potential, Technical Advancements, and Economic Feasibility
AB  - In this study we aim to evaluate carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrate sequestration in ultradeep marine settings, focusing on the Indian deepwater context. Major scientific issues and opportunities are highlighted, including methane (CH4) production through hydrate formation. Economic, regulatory, and technical aspects are explored comprehensively, considering Indian offshore zones. The research involves comparing deposition and potential reserves with CO2 hydrate formation characteristics, kinetic promoters, and potential factors for optimal design criteria. Factors affecting hydrate development, like porosity, salinity, and CO2 interactions, are discussed. Technological and environmental feasibility of hydrate-based carbon sequestration in subsea basins are established. Challenges include kinetics, diffusion, and economics for large-scale Indian basin testing. Chemical interactions, pore water saturation, and depositional environment effects are summarized. We also outline the research necessary for commercial CO2 hydrate storage in Indian basins, building upon previous work. This research contributes to CO2 sequestration and substantial CH4 production in deep marine environments. Â© 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Technology Demonstration of Multi-Species (CO2, SO2, NO2, & PM) Capture
AB  - Post-combustion capture of carbon dioxide usually requires other upstream pollutant capture systems such as selective catalytic reduction for NOx, flue gas desulfurization, electrostatic precipitators, etc (Dziejarski et al. (2023)). Traditional carbon capture technologies cannot be deployed at point emission sources that do not have these systems and use fuels containing sulfur (e.g., heavy fuel oil, sour gas, etc.). A novel pollutant capture system is being developed at KAUST that eliminates this limitation. A Cryogenic Carbon and Sulfur Capture (CCSC) technology is developed in partnership with Sustainable Energy Solutions (SES, part of Chart Industries). This technology focuses on post-combustion CO2 capture along with SO2, NO2, and other Particulate Matter (PM) pollutants. CCSC is modular in design and mounted on a 15-meter-long trailer. The multi-species co-capture system is mounted in the central section of the trailer and includes a separate control room and gas storage room on either end of the trailer. This trailer-mounted CCSC system has a nominal capacity of capturing 0.25 ton of CO2/day. This CCSC process cools exhaust flue gases below the desublimating temperatures of CO2 (~âˆ’130Â°C) where CO2 solidifies out of the flue gas. This separation process is done by spraying isopentane as a contact liquid into an upward-moving flue gas. CO2 freezes into the contact liquid and ultimately flows out as a slurry. The contact liquid is regenerated via screwpress, and then the interstitial liquid is recovered via distillation. An additional column is necessary for the separation of a third species SO2. The main objective of this trailer rig is to serve as a technology and IP development platform to cocapture multiple pollutants all using a single technology. The trailer rig is designed to be flue gas agnostic and finds applications in many facilities. Even though the system is currently optimized for the most probable site which is a heavy fuel oil (HFO) fired steam power plant, it can easily be adapted to shipboard carbon capture and co-capture of other pollutants more prominent from marine applications. A wetted-wire patented technology from KAUST (Wagstaff et al. (2022)) already shows promise for shipboard heat and mass transfer. Â© 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Hydrological Potential Mapping to Generate Micro-Hydro Power in Code River
AB  - Fossil fuel energy utilization in Indonesia is consider high consisting of 65% coal sources and 20% fuel, while only 15% are generate from new and renewable energy sources. This number is critical due to the commitment to reduce greenhouse gases by 29% or 41% as declared Glasgow in 2021. Alternatives source of energy could be obtained from solar, wind, and water. The energy generate from those sources are consider intermittent, however, water utilization can be optimized by construct several weirs (small-scale reservoirs) to accumulate the rain water as a kinetic energy source to generate electricity. Only some part of the world, especially tropical Indonesia archipelago, has enough rain to generate energy. This research intends to measure the potency of Code River, representing small river in generating micro-hydro power. The Code River is representing a small river on the island of Java as part of the archipelago in Indonesia which has the characteristics of a river, a small water catchment area, and has high discharge input from rainfall because it is in the tropics. The weir is equipped with a penstock pipe, as water intake to the generator. The pipe inner diameter made of high-density polyethylene material can be 200, 300, 400, 500, 700, 800, 1,000 and 1,600 mm. Each pipe size can produce discharges of 0.42, 0.75, 1.62, 2.1, 3.1, 3.5, 6.0 and 24.0 m3/s respectively. The combination of discharge and head height will produce electrical energy (in watts). Based on hydrological modelling consisting of 52 sub-watersheds, the highest electricity production in 2021 is 8,359,218.3 kWh with 800 mm pipe size (3.5 m3/sec discharge). The electricity production is based on reliable discharge between 7-96% which is different for each weir location. In conclusion, the electricity supply for the whole year (100%) is inadequate Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Evaluation of Carbon Footprint Reduction for a CO2 EOR Injection Scheme Field Pilot
AB  - Enhance oil recovery using CO2 as a solvent is posed to be a major technology in producing energy with a lower carbon footprint. It is therefore important to operate such technologies in an efficient manner. Foam-assisted technologies in which a surfactant aids conformance of the CO2 in-situ, allowing it to produce oil more effectively. This CO2 foam assisted EOR may be a critical technology if the CO2 utilized is of anthropogenic origin and is eventually sequestered underground. As such, having a framework where the potential benefits of foam-assisted technology are calculated is relevant. A calculation framework is introduced in this work with a life cycle thinking approach. To showcase the calculation methodology, a field trial is taken as an example of a successful EOR intervention technology. A field pilot from a trial between The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) and ConocoPhillips (Now Maverick, SPE 201199) is used. Injection and production data, together with industry averages on electricity generation, gas compression, and water treatment, were utilized to calculate energy input into the process prior, during, and post-trial. With this, a reduction of carbon footprint of 17% was realized together with a 30% reduction of freshwater use. Â© Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Change in the community structure and organic carbon content of meio-and macrobenthos between tidal flat and salt marsh areas colonized by Spartina alterniflora in the BahÃ­a Blanca estuary (SW Atlantic); [Cambios en la estructura de la comunidad y contenido de carbono orgÃ¡nico del meio-y macrobentos entre las Ã¡reas de planicies de marea y marismas colonizadas por Spartina alterniflora en el Estuario de BahÃ­a Blanca (AtlÃ¡ntico SO)]
AB  - Salt marshes are regarded as among the most productive coastal ecosystems, important â€œblue carbonâ€ sinks and a support for benthic communities with large abundances, whose structure may be strongly influenced by salt marsh vegetation. During the last few decades, Spartina alterniflora has been colonizing bare mudflats in the BahÃ­a Blanca estuary, and a large increase in the area covered by salt marshes has been reported. This colonization can strongly influence the structure of benthic fauna and its role in the carbon cycle. The hypothesis of this study was that the community structure and the organic carbon contained in the meio-and macrobenthos change between tidal flats and salt marshes recently colonized by S. alterniflora. Response variables studied to compare the tidal flat and salt marsh were density, biomass and production to biomass (P/B) ratio of macro-and meiobenthos. Density and biomass of Gastropoda and P/B ratio of Nematoda were higher on the salt marsh than on the tidal flat. By contrast, density and biomass of Polychaeta were higher on the tidal flat. These results suggest that the expansion of S. alterniflora marshes on tidal flats produces changes in the structure of the macro-and meiobenthos community (taxonomic composition and biomass) that have an influence on carbon cycling.

TI  - On how the ECT fuels the fossil fuel economy: Rockhopper v Italy as a case study
AB  - The central thesis of this article is that the Energy Charter Treaty can be deployed to expand the fossil fuel industryâ€™s rights and contextually counter democratic forces that animate the ecological transition. More specifically, the article shows the entanglement between the suppression of ecological democracy and the expansion of fossil rights. To offer a more granular understanding of how the Energy Charter Treaty empowers the fossil industry, this article zooms in on the case of Rockhopper v Italy. The case was launched in 2017 by the UK company Rockhopper against the Italian Republic because the latter denied a production concession for offshore oil drilling off the coast of Italy. After a long process of resistance from local communities, in 2016, the Italian government adopted a law of general applicability banning offshore drilling within 12 nautical miles of the coast. Drawing on political theory, this article conceptualises peopleâ€™s successful forms of resistance to the oil extractivist project as ecological democracy. By unpacking the main facts underpinning this case and the legal reasoning in the award, the article shows how the Rockhopper award has bestowed new property rights on the fossil fuel investor while contextually compressing democratic spaces vital for the ecological transition..

TI  - CO2 Storage Potential Evaluation of Restricted Saline Aquifers in Peninsular Malaysia Offshore
AB  - Deep saline aquifers offer significant potential for CO2 storage, with successful small-scale projects worldwide and major initiatives such as Gorgon in their early stages. In Peninsular Malaysia (PM) the daily CO2 production rate is expected to reach to the tune of âˆ¼480 to 570 MMscf once the high contaminant gas fields are put on development. Several depleted hydrocarbon fields in PM region have been studied in the past for potential storage of the CO2 to be produced. Previously studies have been conducted on various depleted hydrocarbon fields within the PM region to assess their suitability for storing the anticipated CO2 volume. Nevertheless, the limited storage capacity and availability of these depleted reservoirs necessitate the exploration of alternative solutions. The deep saline aquifers in Peninsular Malaysia emerge as a viable option, as they can address the existing storage capacity limitations and facilitate the efficient development of high contaminant gas fields in the region, thereby enabling expedited monetization efforts. A comprehensive screening matrix was devised to identify strategic saline aquifers, considering various factors such as fault density, presence of top seals, reservoir depth, thickness, extension, pressure, temperature, porosity, number of wells drilled, and data availability. This holistic approach enabled the identification of structures that met the screening criteria. Further analysis was conducted on these selected structures to determine their theoretical CO2 storage capacity. Based on the evaluated capacities and their potential for cluster development, the structures were ranked accordingly. This systematic process allowed for the identification and prioritization of saline aquifers with the greatest potential for CO2 storage and cluster development. This study involves the feasibility study of one such identified clusters comprising three drilled dry structures that were analyzed for their containment and capacity through extensive 3D data interpretation for generation of structural maps, mapping of major and minor faults, and attribute extraction, trap & seal analysis, faults & wells integrity analysis, 1D caprock integrity analysis, and effective storage capacity estimation through dynamic simulation. The study concluded that two out of the three studied structures are associated with high trap risks and may not be suitable for injection & long-term storage of CO2. Further their close proximity to the regional fault would limit their viability for being potential open aquifer systems. The third structure which has well defined trap, seal & reservoir was found to be associated with relatively low effective CO2 storage capacity as based on the current analysis the storage capacity estimation was restricted to only one of the stratigraphic intervals only. The adapted workflow and lessons learnt during this study can be applied to future saline aquifer screening studies involving dry wells in the region. This study further unfolds the necessity of adequate data availability to derisk the critical CO2 storage elements. Â© OE 2023. All rights reserved.

TI  - Designing Pipeline Networks forÂ Carbon Capture andÂ Storage ofÂ CO $$:2$$ -Sources inÂ Germany: An Industry Perspective
AB  - In order to reach the two-degree target set by the Paris Agreement and to avoid rising costs due to $$\mathrm {CO_2}$$ allowances and taxes, $$\mathrm {CO_2}$$ intensive industry sectors like cement, steel and chemicals may opt for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) solutions. CCS involves capturing $$\mathrm {CO_2}$$ emissions at the source points, transporting it to geological storage sites and storing it their permanently. In this context, our study investigates how to design CCS-pipeline networks that connect German cement, steel and organic chemical industries to the geological storage formations provided by the Longship project, Norway. We propose a mixed-integer programming model for the design of a corresponding on- and offshore pipeline network, where seaports serve as intermediate compressor stations for the offshore pipelines. Our results show that the supply chain costs vary significantly across industries due to differences in capture costs, $$\mathrm {CO_2}$$ volumes and the spatial distribution of the point sources. The supply chain costs range from 49.3 Euro per tonne for the organic chemical industry to 83.0 Euro for the steel industry and 108.7 Euro for the cement industry, respectively. With the anticipated increase in the carbon prices in the coming years, CCS might soon become economically desirable for all these industry sectors.

TI  - Impact Assessment of Eco-Friendly Cooling System Implementation on Sea Transportation: A GTAP-E-Power Model Application
AB  - Climate change and global warming have significantly threatened food security and the global supply chain. As the trade volume of bulk commodity grains has been growing steadily, ensuring quality while minimizing losses during long-distance shipping between warm and cold seawater has become a critical issue. An evidence-based approach to provide quantified implications is needed to illustrate a roadmap toward a net-zero-carbon society. This study applied the GTAP-E-Power model to examine the economic and welfare impacts of eco-friendly cooling system implementation on sea transportation in Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. By creating scenarios of Japanâ€™s technology change calibrated from SPIAS-e and capital-use subsidy on sectors of electronics, solar power, and sea transportation as cooling system implementation, the simulation results showed a GDP growth of 0.09% in Japan and 0.11% in Australia and New Zealand. Moreover, Japan's welfare could improve by USD 4,219 million, while greenhouse gas emissions might be reduced to 8.4 million tons, equivalent to 0.9% of the total emission of Japanâ€™s sea transportation sector.

TI  - Comparison of Decarbonization Pathways for Offshore Platforms: Technology Solutions to Address Key Implementation Challenges
AB  - Most companies to date have adopted GHG emission targets in an effort to limit global warming well below 2 Â°C above pre-industrial levels, and 2020 estimations forecast a decrease of about 1/3 of emissions from O&G activities by 2050. It is also foreseen that regulations with economic impact on emissions from hydrocarbon production will be progressively adopted. This is triggering oil and gas (O&G) attention to find faster and economic ways to decarbonize while maintaining operational performance. Several types of initiatives are being considered including the reduction of flaring and venting, mitigation of methane leaks, increasing efficiency in energy use, use of renewable energy, and electrification of processes, in combination with the use of digital tools, and advanced monitoring to optimize performance. In this work we focus on a comparison of different decarbonization pathways for an offshore platform. It is assumed that the platform is already in place and in operation, and that the industry is already taking the required actions to reduce flaring and venting and mitigating methane leaks. The analysis starts by identifying the major contributors to the GHG emissions from the platform, which in this case is the power system, followed by fluid related processes like compression, separation, heating for transportation, and other associated operations. Public data from international energy agencies indicates that approximately 16 TWh/year is used to power offshore oil and gas platforms globally. We analyze the following five decarbonization pathways: a) improved energy use-decreasing the energy demand of the processes running on the platform and associated operations, b) increasing the efficiency of the power generation source, c) changing the nature of power source (renewable â€“ wind, solar, wave, hybrid systems), d) implementing carbon capture units, and e) electrifying the facility (partial/full electrification cases). The analysis includes a comparison of promising concepts under each of the proposed pathways and summarize the challenges and opportunities offshore O&G operators have to implement them. Some of the alternatives are based on technology already used in the oil and gas industry, or in other industries, while in some others the technology is still under development. Reference is made to novel technology with potential to address the identified challenges for the different pathway options. We use a simplified metric system to highlight the most effective solutions according to location of the platform and its distance to shore. A discussion of what we will be needed for such pathways to be feasible is also presented. Â© 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - How an Autonomous Offshore Power System Can Transform the Ocean Economy-A Hypothetical Case Study Utilizing an Autonomous Offshore Power System in Northern Lights Carbon Capture and Storage Project
AB  - An Autonomous Offshore Power System (AOPS) provides in-situ power, energy storage, real-time data and communications support, asset management, and other capabilities at sea. It has applications for all offshore industries: energy, defense and security, aquaculture, science and research, and communications. This paper highlights how an AOPS can reduce cost, complexity, and carbon-intensity for existing offshore operations and enable new capabilities for offshore industry leaders. This new AOPS technology has two primary advantages. First, it unlocks the autonomous, electric future of the ocean economy via â€˜localâ€™ power generation and energy storage, in addition to real-time connection to the data cloud. Second, it helps enable a material change in the global energy mix through cost-effective, reliable generation and storage technology for use cases including mobile/static data-gathering and reporting systems, operating equipment, and charging networks for uncrewed surface vessels. AOPS technology will help transform the ocean economy, and thus has implications for offshore industry leaders as they push to reduce costs today and make an autonomous and decarbonized future possible. A SeaRAY AOPS, which is the focus of this paper, consists of three primary components: â€¢ C-Powerâ€™s SeaRAY surface wave power system â€¢ â€¢ A non-complex, combined mooring, data communications, and power system Verlumeâ€™s Halo seafloor energy storage and intelligent energy management system The following paper highlights both a real-world and hypothetical deployment of a SeaRAY AOPS, demonstrating its ability to benefit a diverse array of activity in the ocean economy. First, the paper details the work of C-Power and Verlume, in partnership with the U.S. Navy, U.S. Department of Energy, Saab, R2Sonic, Hibbard Inshore, and other industry leaders, to deploy an AOPS at the Wave Energy Test Site in Hawaii for six months, beginning in the first half of 2023. The Hawaii AOPS will power multiple mobile and static assets capable of delivering persistent, self-contained, and self-powered intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and reporting capabilities for 24x7x52 maritime defense and border security. The ability to support this use case demonstrates AOPS applicability across a wide variety of offshore Lights greenfield opportunity using an AOPS in lieu of a power and data umbilical, brownfield upgrades or replacements of failed/failing umbilicals are equally applicable scenarios.

AB  - In the global effort to reach near-term reductions in Green-House Gas (GHG) emissions, all Energy Companies have set an integrated strategy for a low-carbon future. The decarbonization target makes evident the need to also quantify the carbon footprint of well construction activities. The major direct emission source in Drilling and Completion (D&C) is represented by the fuel burnt by diesel generators at rig site to feed tools, machinery, and auxiliary systems. Therefore, data related to fuel consumption are fundamental to have a clear understanding of rig carbon footprint. In this framework, a dedicated GHG module was introduced within an existing real-time advanced analytic tool to unlock the possibility to track and map the CO2 equivalent emissions associated to the fuel consumption of Eni's rigs. This tool has been designed to collect and analyze the different data sources available at the rig site, typically sensor data, recorded at high frequency (1-5 sec), and reporting data, recorded at low frequency (1-2 hrs). The data are combined, with a specific algorithm, to automatically identify the activity ongoing and its related emissions. After that, data are gathered and consolidated to make them available in headquarters in near real-time. Furthermore, the tool was also applied to a case study by comparing its outcomes with the data directly provided by a rig contractor, showing a good level of reliability and consistency. The capability to monitor GHG emissions during D&C activities allows a better understanding of their related impact. It provides useful insights to implement corrective action and tackle them promptly. Finally, operation monitoring is directly linked with its related GHG emissions allowing new types of analysis and considerations. This integrated tool, able to recognize the most carbon-demanding activities, optimizes the process of targeting suitable solutions for GHG abatements during the well construction process. Having CO2 emissions reduction become crucial, this approach will certainly be the backbone of the transformation that Oil & Gas sector will have to undergo to reach its carbon neutrality commitments.

TI  - The Importance of Secondary Traps and Sinks in Offshore CO2 Sequestration
AB  - Geologic carbon sequestration currently focuses on injection of supercritical CO2 into reservoirs, often in a depleted hydrocarbon field. Seal integrity above these reservoirs is therefore critical for safe long-term storage of CO2. It is generally assumed that if a reservoir was able to contain hydrocarbons for millions of years, it should be suitable for CO2 storage. However, many hydrocarbon reservoirs leak, probably best documented by the ubiquitous natural gas and oil seeps observed e.g., in the Gulf of Mexico. With integration of seismic and geochemical data and fate-transport modeling there is capability to select efficient storage locations in the deep coastal sediment and provide accurate assessment of CO2 residence time. We propose that even if reservoirs leak CO2, abiotic and biogeochemical reactions from the injection point to the ocean floor surface provide diverse traps that result in efficient sediment CO2 sequestration. First, during the migration concentration in porewater becoming supersaturated can result in a carbonate formation. This carbonate formation may cause a trap and with the CO2 build up there can be pressurization that results in horizontal migration to a new vertical path or pressurization that results in fractures of carbonate or clay layers. This transport can occur at multiple intervals during migration to the surface sediment and this step-by-step trapping slows down long-term vertical migration.

TI  - Development of a Screening Framework for Re-Use of Existing Wells for CCUS Projects Considering Regulatory, Experimental and Technical Aspects
AB  - Oil and gas fields that have reached their end of economic life provide a potential option for geologic CO2 storage in support of the energy transition and efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. Re-use of these existing wells can potentially result in significant cost savings compared to drilling new wells, but also presents a challenge for CCUS (Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage) development. Prior to conversion, evaluation of the feasibility of re-using existing oil and gas wells will be required, including consideration of operational and safety requirements. Currently, there are no standard approaches or public tools available to aid in the technical evaluation and to support decision making on well re-use potential for CO2 storage. The REX-CO2 (Re-using EXisting wells for CO2 storage operations) project, funded by the ACT (Accelerating CCUS Technologies) program has developed a first-of-its-kind assessment framework and evaluation tool based on state-of-the-art practices, standards, guidelines and international reference projects. The tool is designed to utilize available data on well construction, subsurface geology, well operational and integrity history to screen the re-usability of wells for CO2 storage operations. The tool provides a thorough qualitative evaluation of the current re-usability potential of existing wells and highlights the most important issues requiring further detailed analysis. The results can be used to design and select mitigation options, ultimately identifying the most promising candidate wells. The tool has been applied to multiple international case studies with tens of wells, both onshore and offshore, covering a wide range of well designs and subsurface settings. The overall goal was to test and demonstrate the evaluation process, identify remediation activities and providing a high-level cost benefit analysis. The tool has recently been applied successfully in the Middle East region for one of the national oil companies, showcasing the assessment framework and identifying potential remediation activities to safely convert a selection of wells into CO2 injectors. The tool development is supplemented by experimental research focused on well cement integrity due to its role as a well barrier element. The emphasis is on mechanical and chemical degradations and damage processes on well barrier elements, including investigation of novel self-healing and active remediation measures. In addition, state-of-the-art research on the conditions of well materials expected in CO2 injection wells have been described, providing recommendations for material selection in a CO2 CCUS storage setting. Lastly, the project evaluated the regulatory and environmental frameworks, permit requirements and social perspectives related to re-using existing oil and gas wells for CO2 storage. All aspects (technical & non-technical) have been integrated in a final set of recommendations to provide insights into the factors that need to be addressed when considering existing wells for re-use in CO2 storage operations.

TI  - Dynamic Characteristics of Supercritical CO2 Injection in Depleted Carbonate Oil Reservoir for its Sequestration Potential: An Experimental Study
AB  - To reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and mitigate the severe consequences of climate change, capturing, utilizing, and storing CO2 has become very important for human survival. For utilization of CO2 in reservoir engineering practice, CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2EOR) as a mature technology has been widely applied in several types of reservoirs such as sandstone, carbonate, and shale gas/oil reservoirs, and the focus of concern is to study oil recovery efficiency and its influencing factors over the past few decades. Recently, more and more researchers are paying great attention to the geological storage of carbon dioxide in depleted oil reservoirs where scCO2 is injected as a displacing agent for secondary and tertiary oil recovery. Unfortunately, there is a lack of laboratory research on scCO2 sequestration in such reservoirs in terms of capacity, two-phase flow (the mixture of scCO2 and residual oil and water), injectivity of scCO2, and permeability loss of rocks. In this study, we evaluate the dynamic characteristics mentioned above subjective is based on laboratory results. Several experiments, including different injection modes such as horizontal and vertical injections, and their effects on displacing residual oil and water by scCO2 after water flooding has been performed using reservoir carbonate rock, live crude oil, and seawater under reservoir conditions. As a result of this study, the experimental methodology to obtain the scCO2 storage capacity of the depleted oil reservoir was proposed for the first time, and the calculation of scCO2 storage capacity assumes that the scCO2 dissolves into residual water and oil after scCO2 injection. This study found that the main scCO2 storage mechanism is pore space storage (structural trapping) for depleted oil reservoirs. Based on experimental results, the storage efficiency is found to be closely related to the permeability of rocks. In addition, the scCO2 injectivity and permeability loss of the rock were evaluated for a depleted carbonate reservoir, which was displaced by scCO2 injection at the final stage of the oil recovery process. The experimental results show that the scCO2 injectivity is not strongly affected, although the relative permeability to scCO2 slightly decreased after the scCO2EOR process. The experimental results can be applied directly for the evaluation and strategy of scCO2 storage and can be used to simulate the performance of the injection process of scCO2 storage.

TI  - Feasibility study of hydrogen jet flame ignition of ammonia fuel in marine low speed engine
AB  - As the global carbon emission reduction actions become more serious, the development of alternative fuel combustion solutions on engines has good prospect. Ammonia and hydrogen fuels have their own advantages and disadvantages, but the mixture of the two has good compatibility. However, in the current ammonia-hydrogen mixture combustion, spark ignition or compression ignition has certain limitations on large-bore marine engines. The development of a jet flame pilot scheme similar to pilot oil can effectively reduce the demand for hydrogen fuel and high ignition energy. A scheme of igniting ammonia fuel with a hydrogen jet flame was proposed, which realized the normal full-load power output of the marine low-speed engine. The temperature and reactivity atmosphere required for combustion brought by the jet flame to the cylinder, especially the high concentration of H radicals, helped to establish the OH and O radicals conditions required for combustion, and effectively promoted ammonia early combustion. In addition, NOx emission can meet the tier III standard by optimizing the ignition timing of the hydrogen jet flame in some case. This scheme has good potential in emissions, while relatively better power output and engine performance. Â© 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC

TI  - Microbial degradation of lignocellulosic biomass for bioenergy production: A metagenomic-based approach
AB  - Biofuels are obtained from various renewable biological sources and considered suitable alternatives to conventional energy sources in the coming future. Biofuel is deemed essential to bioenergy, which can help achieve the 2030 agenda of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs). Lignocellulosic materials convert into fermentable sugars by several pre-treatment methods. Several microbial lignocellulolytic enzymes play a significant role in degrading pre-treated lignocellulosic biomass into biofuels. These biomass-degrading enzymes have been screened only from a few cultured microorganisms. These problems related to biomass-degrading enzymes can be solved by screening novel microbial enzymes using metagenomic approaches. Â© 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Research on in-situ remote offshore wind-power consumption based on ice-slurry cold storage; [åŸºäºŽæµæ€å†°æµ†è“„å†·çš„æ·±è¿œæµ·é£Žç”µå°±åœ°æ¶ˆçº³]
AB  - Considering the high cost and limitations of long-distance offshore wind-power transmission in far-reaching sea, a technical route is proposed herein using ice slurry as a cold storage medium for wind-power elimination in remote offshore spots. Considering a single wind-driven generator in the South China Sea as the research object, performance and economic evaluation models were developed to analyze the cycle coefficient of performance, ice-making speed, unit power consumption, annual cost, and unit ice-making cost. The generator unit was also compared with ice-making machines in shipboard scenarios. The results showed that in the case of water extraction from below the sea surface and replenishing freshwater for ice making, the ice-making speed of the ice-slurry generator unit based on wind power reached 57.18 t/h and the unit power consumption was 39.47 kWh/t. Compared with seawater flake ice-making machines operating at the same power, the ice-making speed was increased by 80.4% and the unit power consumption was reduced by 51.1%. The unit exhibited high production capacity and energy efficiency; the ratio of annual cooling capacity loss from the ice storage tank did not exceed 2.7% of the refrigeration capacity, and it did not exceed 5% when all cooling capacity losses were combined. Moreover, it remained almost unaffected by changes in the seawater flow velocity. The insulation capability of the unit was also excellent. Considering the cooling capacity loss, the annual ice production of the unit reached 951700 tons, which can refrigerate at least 475850 tons of seafood and supply ice to more than 1100 1000-ton fishing ships, indicating that it could meet large-scale ice requirements. The unit's annual cost was 17587000 CNY, and the cost of producing ice slurry was as low as 36.96 CNY per ton, which was 47.3% less than that of a seawater flake ice-making machine in a shipboard scenario. These findings indicate the strong competitiveness and good economic feasibility of the unit. Â© 2023 Editorial office of Energy Storage Science and Technology. All rights reserved.

TI  - Solar photovoltaic systems for the Short Sea Shipping's compliance with decarbonization regulations in the European Union
AB  - Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) regulation came into force In January 2023 as one of the main International Maritime Organization's measures to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG). Short Sea Shipping (SSS) demand signifi-cant electricity supply by reaching up to 30\% of total on-board power. This paper addresses SSS-fleet compliance with CII regulation, Market and Goal-Based Measures imposed by the European Union (EU) through solar photovoltaic systems (PV) for on-board electricity production. The paper analyses the techno-economic feasi-bility of this solution from the shipowners' standpoint in the medium-term. To meet this aim, a SSS Car-carrier between Canary Islands and Iberian Peninsula is assessed by simulating PV performance, vessel's technical implications, and economic consequences of GHG mitigation in the context of the EU. The results reveal that PV reduces fuel consumption for electricity generation by 15.5\% by reducing the total CO2 emissions by 3.38\%. Although this improvement is not substantial enough to change the CII score of the vessel, the Internal Rate of Return of the PV investment achieved 55\% for 10 years with three years as payback period. This fact along with the robustness of the results achieved suggest PV system is a promising mitigation option for SSS vessels.

TI  - Feasibility of a self-powered movable seawall using microtidal energy in Japan
AB  - The technology for closing port entrances using movable gates as a tsunami countermeasure has recently garnered increasing attention in Japan. However, it is not possible to mechanically operate the gates if power is lost because of a disaster. Accordingly, this study proposes a self-powered movable seawall system that utilizes microtidal energy generated by port closure for operating the gates. As tidal ranges in Japan are not favorable for power generation, the feasibility of the proposed system was assessed at 56 ports throughout Japan. The self-powered system was found feasible at nine ports during both spring and neap tide and at 14 ports during spring tide, whereas the tidal range was too small to operate the system at the other 33 ports. Moreover, 20 feasible ports were located such that tsunamis are predicted to occur in the scenario of a megathrust earthquake, which has a 90 % occurrence probability in the next 40 years. Surplus electricity is expected to be generated on-site with the proposed system, even if a power outage occurs, which is especially valuable for urgent disaster response and business continuity in industrial areas. Our findings outline a synergistic system between disaster prevention and the use of renewable energy. Â© 2023 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Comparisons of Different Propulsion Topologies of Service Ships for Islands
AB  - Maritime transport is one of the main drivers of a country's economic growth. Up to 90% of world trade is carried out by sea. However, the high consumption of fossil fuels leads to significant greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants emissions, such as the nitrogen dioxide (NOx) and the sulfur oxides (SOx). Decarbonizing maritime transport, through the transition to electrified propulsion, is a major challenge for researchers and engineers in the naval construction sector. This paper studies electric, thermal and hybrid energy/propulsion solutions for ships serving the island of Ouessant, located near Brittany's coast in France. Using a simplified methodology based on power flows between the various components (batteries, generators, fuel cells), the most suitable type of energy is investigated according to the case study, for efficient and effective vessel use. The simulations show that the energy consumption of the fully electric solution is the best with 5.78 MWh consumed against, for example, 13.89 MWh equivalent of fuel for the classic diesel topology.

TI  - An innovative biomass-driven energy systems for green energy and freshwater production with less CO2 emission: Environmental and technical approaches
AB  - Considering the current crisis of fossil energies, the exploitation of renewables and green technologies is necessary and unavoidable. Additionally, the design and development of integrated energy systems with two or more output products and the maximum usage of thermal losses in order to improve efficiency can boost the yield and acceptability of the energy system. In this regard, this paper develops a comprehensive multi-aspect assessment of the operation of a new solar and biomass energies-driven multigeneration system (MGS). The main units installed in MGS are three electric energy generation units based on a gas turbine process, a solid oxide fuel cell unit (SOFCU) and an organic Rankine cycle unit (ORCU), a biomass energy conversion unit to useful thermal energy, a seawater conversion unit into useable freshwater, a unit for converting water and electricity into hydrogen energy and oxygen gas, a unit for converting solar energy into useful thermal energy (based on Fresnel collector), and a cooling load generation unit. The planned MGS has a novel configuration and layout that has not been considered by researchers recently. The current article is based on presenting a multi-aspect evaluation to study thermodynamic-conceptual, environmental and exergoeconomic analyzes. The outcomes indicated that the planned MGS can produce about 6.31 MW of electrical power and 0.49 MW of thermal power. Furthermore, MGS is able to produce various products such as potable water (âˆ¼0.977 kg/s), cooling load (âˆ¼0.16 MW), hydrogen energy (âˆ¼1.578 g/s) and sanitary water (âˆ¼0.957 kg/s). The total thermodynamic indexes were calculated as 78.13% and 47.72%, respectively. Also, the total investment and unit exergy costs were 47.16 USD per hour and 11.07 USD per GJ, respectively. Further, the content of CO2 emitted from the desgined system was equal to 10.59 kmol per MWh. A parametric study has been also developed to identify influencing parameters. Â© 2023

TI  - Clean energy for sustainable electric power generations
AB  - Fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas have been the primary fuels for power generation for the last 150 years in the world. The use of these resources is much more rapid than they are being formed. At present, fossil fuels as an energy source account for nearly 70% of the world's energy despite the efforts to transition away from a fossil fuel economy. Currently, there is a growing interest in zero-carbon energy sources. Nuclear energy is one such source of this effect, which is expensive. Moreover, radioactive waste disposal, which is long-lasting, is a significant hurdle as it is hazardous and costly. Only developed countries such as U.S, France, and Japan have installed nuclear reactors for electric power generation; even the share of nuclear power generation in these countries is less than 20%. Nowadays, renewable or clean energy sources, including solar, wind, tidal, ocean thermal, geothermal, and biomass, are emerging as alternatives to conventional fossil fuels for power generation. However, their share remains below 25% of global energy sources. There are numerous benefits to opting for renewable energy sources for power generation. Firstly, they are renewable, and thus there is no chance of their depletion. Secondly, the pollutants emitted by these resources are fewer and cause no harm to humans and the environment. However, harnessing some of these energy sources involves enormous capital costs. On the other hand, the intermittent and variable nature of these resources is another drawback. This chapter briefly introduces various clean energy sources and highlights their potential for sustainable power generation. Â© 2023 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Profile Autonomous Underwater Vehicle System for Offshore Surveys
AB  - Offshore marine engineering, offshore aquaculture, and offshore environmental protection require periodic offshore surveys. At present, the main means of offshore marine surveys are mooring buoys and marine survey ships. Anchored buoys are fixed in place for a long time, which affects the navigation of ships. Therefore, mooring buoys cannot be deployed over a large area with high density. The cost of marine survey ships is high, especially when multipoint synchronous marine surveys are needed, and marine survey ships cannot perform offshore surveys under bad sea conditions. A profile autonomous underwater vehicle system is developed to meet the requirements of multipoint short-term synchronous offshore surveys. It is a small, reusable, low-cost equipment designed to move up and down at a mooring position while measuring temperature, salinity, depth, and other quantities along a vertical water section. Profile autonomous underwater vehicles can be commanded remotely and report their measurements in near real-time via wireless telemetry. The time it takes for a profile AUV to move up and down can indicate the current velocity. Tests were carried out on a wharf and in offshore areas, and the results were satisfactory.

TI  - The Low Emission Oil and Gas Open reference platformâ€”An off-grid energy system for renewable integration studies
AB  - This article introduces and describes the integrated energy system of the Low Emission Oil and Gas Open reference platform. It is a hypothetical case meant to represent a typical oil and gas installation in the North Sea. The aim of this detailed specification is to serve as an open reference case where all the information about it can be publicly shared, facilitating benchmarking and collaboration. The relevance of this reference case of an off-grid energy system is not limited to the oil and gas industry, since it can also be seen as a special kind of electrical micro grid. The remote offshore location makes it especially relevant for studying offshore wind power and ocean energy sources like wave power. The specification has an emphasis on the energy system and electrical configuration, but also includes a basic description of the oil field and processing system. The intention is that it will serve as a basis for energy system studies and relating power system stability analyses regarding the integration of renewable energy sources. This allows for comparisons of a base case with different design modifications, new operational planning methods, power management strategies and control concepts. Examples of possible modifications are the replacement of gas turbines by wind turbines, addition of energy storage systems, a more variable operation of loads etc. The last part of the article demonstrates the behaviour of the reference platform implemented in two software tools: one for operational planning and one for dynamic power system analyses.

TI  - Sustainable Energy Solution for Cold Storage Planning and Assessment
AB  - Energy is a prime commodity in the entire urbanization process across the globe. In the fabric of urbanization, Islands have major setback in energy generation, raw material transportation and grid integration due to their location constraints. Their dependencies on sea and sea products further adds storage unit issue i.e. cold storages for sustainable economic operation. Cold storages require energy supply round the clock. But, the fast pace denouement of Non-renewable energy resources across the globe leads to energy deficiency which is the major cause of concern. This work focuses on providing an optimal solution for providing continuous supply to cold storages. For case study, a location of Island has been selected and analyzed to meet continuous power demanded by the cold storages. Furthermore, there exists urge to integrate pre-existing elderly power plants with solar power plants for efficient supply. The outcome of the proposed solar power plant in terms of performance metrics like performance ratio (PR), annual energy (AE) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) shows the feasibility of the provided solution. Typically, PR (66.33%), AE (751195KWh) and LCOE (2.02Â¢/kWh) respectively, manifests that the proposed power plant is a viable solution to address the aforementioned problems.  Â© 2023 IEEE.

TI  - Numerical Analysis and Model Test of Dry Towing of Deep-water Semi-Submersible Platform
AB  - Deepwater semi-submersible platform is the mainstream production mode for offshore oil and gas field development at home and abroad. After the semi-submersible production platform is built, the platform transportation mode is determined according to the towing distance. If the semi-submersible platform is far away from the installation site, the semi-submersible platform shall be towed to the sea area suitable for loading by dry towing. The transportation vessel shall dry tow the semi-submersible to the predetermined sea area for unloading, and then wet tow the platform to the installation site. Taking Lingshui17-2 semi-submersible platform as an example, this paper conducts hydrodynamic analysis on dry towing of transportation vessel through 3D potential flow analysis software, studies the six degree of freedom motion response under the combined action of wind, wave and current, conducts time domain analysis, calculates the motion from time domain analysis for 10-year non-cyclone conditions of dry towing key points, and conducts comparative analysis in combination with model test. In addition, the water immergence analysis of FPU when dry tow under typical transport conditions is carried out to ensure transport safety, which provides a theoretical basis for the safety of dry towing of FPU. The calculation method can be used for reference by similar projects and is of great significance. Â© 2023 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

AB  - we know that, air pollution has increased tremendously due to growth in population. Since because of the everyday increase in power demand, there is always a gap observed between energy generated and energy consumed. Due to generation constraints and to match the required load demand, methods of non-conventional energy sources have been attracted more attention amongst winds, solar, biomass, and tidal sources of producing electricity. The study and development of solar-based energy generation and its different applications mainly in transportation for urban and rural sectors have been wide attention. Looking to this fact in this paper, an effort has been made to study fundamental design aspects for solar-based electric vehicles to develop a prototype to judge its suitability as an alternative to electrical vehicles operating in another field like petrol diesel CNG.

TI  - Renewable Energy Based Microgrid Scheme for Greener Ship: Evaluation through Techno-Economic Performance Analysis
AB  - To address the growing energy crisis and environmental pollution, it's crucial to explore new energy sources for ships. The current study describes the feasibility of a renewable energy based microgrid system i.e., photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine with battery storage system for maritime transportation. An economic and technical evaluation of renewable energy-based configurations is evaluated through Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software tool. The study reveals that the Wind/battery/PV system is the most optimum among the studied microgrid system for the designed loading demands as it offers less net present cost (NPC) and breakeven cost of energy (COE).

TI  - A Model-Based Evaluation of Wave Collision Effects on the Multi-Objective Optimization of Hybrid Ships Sizing
AB  - Ship hybridization has increasingly attracted attention to accomplish the 2050 emission goals. However, despite the recent benefits of utilizing a hybrid ship power system, additional power fluctuation sources in an All-Electric Ship (AES) power system have evolved. These variations must be thoroughly examined at the vessel design and control level. Otherwise, the optimum performance of the ship power system in various sea situations cannot be theoretically guaranteed. One of the crucial circumstances under which propellers generate power variations in the AES's power system is wave collision. This paper focuses on the effect of ship motions on the sizing and control optimization of hybrid ship propulsion systems at the design level. First, a model-based approach is proposed for integrating the in-and-out-of-water effect into an existing load profile from a specific journey. By utilizing the proposed strategy, a load profile can be modified to represent the power fluctuation of the extreme conditions. Then, a nested double-layer multi-objective optimization problem for sizing and controlling hybrid vessels is presented. The influence of incorporating wave collision on the sizing optimization of hybrid vessels is investigated using the presented optimization approach and model-based load profile adjustment. It is shown that the in-and-out-of-water effect resulting from ship movements in extreme conditions can substantially impact the sizing of the all-electric ship's components. In addition, it can significantly increase the diesel fuel consumption of the vessel. Therefore, the ship motions should be considered to ensure an optimum design and control in various operation conditions during the ship's lifespan. Â© 2023 IEEE.

TI  - Halsafjorden Suspension bridge on floating foundation. Design and CO2 emission
AB  - Halsafjorden is an about 2100m wide and 490m deep fjord part of the Ferry free E-39 project in Norway. A two-span suspension bridge supported by a Tension Leg Platform is proposed for the crossing. Reducing the span compared to an ordinary long span suspension bridge opens for use of a conventional single box aerodynamic bridge deck, instead of a twin box deck needed for long span suspension bridges. Thus, the overall weight of the superstructure is reduced, while the complexity and material use increase for the substructure due to the floater system. The proposed design covers all relevant loads, including ship impact. Metocean loads were derived from a long-term analysis based on the extensive wind and wave measurement campaign started in 2017 and still ongoing. Wind tunnel test of the deck were performed to obtain aerodynamic input for the analysis. Local FEM analysis was used to verify complex areas of design. The design was done in close collaboration with the architect to secure a visually attractive structure. Offshore foundation design was challenging, but a reliable design was possible due to performing offshore ground investigations. Based on proposed design and construction method and EPD material data, C02 emission was calculated and compared to reference projects. Â© 2023 IABSE. Published by American Chemical Society.

TI  - A Decade of Multilateral Technology Installation Improvements Down Under
AB  - Multilateral completions increase reservoir exposure while reducing the investment by minimizing the equipment and the installation time compared to two individual wells. multilaterals (MLT) wells in the Northwest shelf of Australia have been installed for over a decade now. An overview of these operations, well architectures, technology evolution, reliability and efficiency are discussed in the paper. This paper reviews the custom solutions developed throughout the past decade illustrating not only the industry maturity, but also specific advancements in multilateral completion technology that were pioneered in the region. The study is focused on subsea multilateral campaigns, where multiple global and regional first installations took place in mature fields. Operational and technological advancements were implemented throughout the campaigns based on lessons learned. Inaugural deployments featured pre-milled windows, inner-string based liner orientation methods, and a dedicated cleanout trip. Operational modifications and new technologies were introduced to significantly reduce installation time and costs. The first multilateral installation completed in Australia by the service company was in 2006. Over several different projects with different operators in Australia, one particular system was the basis for successfully deployed variants, delivering over thirty productive laterals where mechanical and hydraulic integrity was achieved at each junction. The study demonstrates how the continual advancement of technologies and efficiencies resulted in a reduction of MLT installation time by nearly half since the first system was installed. This encompasses not only new installations, but also infill re-entry applications as well. Additional cost reductions were realized with the introduction of trilateral well construction. This was accomplished by addressing and mitigating risks inherent to adding more junctions to the configuration. This case study focuses on the offshore MLT well construction techniques and demonstrates how introducing both technology and efficiency changes can drive optimized time and costs amid oil price uncertainty. This paper also provides insight as to methodology for continually improving reliability of MLT installations, even while well complexity increases. Â© Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - FPSO Longitudinal Cargo Tank Arrangement
AB  - The use of floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessels for offshore oil production has been deemed the most effective solution, mainly for deep waters applications where they eliminate the need to lay an expensive long-distance pipeline to an onshore terminal. Another advantage is its storage capacity of up to fourteen days of total oil production. The cargo tanks are arranged below the ship deck in the hull to store this production. So far, the arrangement of the tanks is the same as used in oil tankers from which the FPSO design came. This paper presents a longitudinal cargo tank arrangement that aims to reduce the amount of equipment and piping on the FPSO deck. This longitudinal arrangement saves topside weight and space and reduces FPSO construction and commission time. Further benefits are achieved by reducing the cost of operating and maintaining the storage and offloading systems due to reducing the number of cargo pumps and piping.

TI  - Subsea 3D Video Survey of Mooring Chains - Improving Safety, Effectiveness and Efficiency
AB  - Production of oil & gas using moored Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) units has been experiencing a significant growth. As of July 2022, there were 209 FPSOs in use around the world. In addition, there are many moored FSOs and CALM buoys. Moored facilities are located in many different operating areas, environments and water depths. This growth has resulted in a major challenge to operators, mooring component suppliers, regulators, and Class Societies to assure the integrity of these facilities. Mooring chains are safety-critical systems for FPSO and moored facilities in general. They are subject to significant environmental and structural loads as currents, waves, drag forces but also impacts, abrasion with the seabed or the fairlead. Failures in a mooring line can result in dramatic consequences for the safety, the environment, and the productions. Periodic inspections are mandatory and can be performed in air or in situ. Several techniques are available, with their advantages and limitations. This paper discusses the motivation and business driver for developing and implementing a new and cost-effective in situ inspection methodology. The approach is based on 3D video survey performed by inspection class ROVs and robotic crawlers that allows to gather critical integrity information in a safer, effective Due to the conditions and the geometrical configuration, the Subsea 3D Survey of Mooring Chains is challenging. However, by using advanced photogrammetry, and laser triangulation techniques (Video Laser Scanâ„¢ or VLSâ„¢), it is possible to solve such a challenge from simple ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicles) flights and robotic crawler runs when it comes to tiny spaces (Fairlead). The VLSâ„¢ sensor (HD camera and Laser Line Projector) is mounted on the ROV that flies along the chain: the laser line scans the links' surface, and four linear paths along the chain ensure 360 degrees of coverage. The ROV is in flying mode and needs to follow the chain at an average distance of about 1m. The output is a high-accuracy Point Cloud from which dimensions of the links can be computed, as well as the 3D mapping of anomalies such as corrosion pits. Examples are presented, and comparison is made between traditional and new inspection methodologies based on recent mooring chains' inspection campaigns to demonstrate the improvement of inspection effectiveness and efficiency.

TI  - Normally Unattended FPSO Design
AB  - Considering the last 50 years of offshore activity experience and the evolution of the technology, unattended installation designs started to be proposed for application. The focus is to reduce the O&M cost keeping operational reliability and safety. Although some of the low-complex process platforms have been unattended and operated on for many years, especially for small or marginal fields with OPEX/CAPEX restraints, nowadays, unattended platforms for new oil discoveries requiring more complex installations are being considered. A new approach to design, O&M, and logistics is being adopted to enable more complex processing platforms to operate as unattended installations. The unattended platform will be operated remotely by the operational team onshore, and the maintenance team will be aboard only when required for corrective maintenance or during planned preventive maintenance. Unattended platform design philosophy should prioritize the simplicity and the reduction of systems and equipment on board, focusing on maintainability and keeping high operational efficiency. This paper presents a functional analysis of the usual systems that compound a manned FPSO design aiming at its suitability for an unattended FPSO (Floating, Production, Storage, and Offloading) design with remote operation. This system functional analysis defines each system as not required, required with optimization, required with a new concept, and required with no significant changes. As a result, new system concepts are proposed focusing on moving away maintenance and operational personnel. Â© Copyright 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Optimization of Development Technology Policy for Offshore Heavy Oil Reservoirs
AB  - One of offshore heavy oil reservoirs was put into production in 2018. At present, the area is in the early stage of development. The liquid production level is rising, the productivity level is stable, the water cut is gradually increasing. The whole reservoir is in the stage of low liquid production, medium and low water cut and low recovery ratio. The remaining reserves are rich, the abundance of the remaining reserves in main production layers is high, and the tapping potential of remaining oil is large. Due to the influence of edge water and reservoir heterogeneity, the regularity of water cut rise in different layers varies greatly. It is necessary to carry out development technical policy research, stabilizes the amount of liquid and control water cut, produce and develop efficiently, and improve stage recovery ratio. The research shows that now is just the opportunity to adjust the liquid production structure reasonably, and the liquid volume and water injection volume should be calculated according to the prediction chart of injection and production, reasonable adjustment of liquid production structure will be implemented. During the process of production and development, the formation pressure should not be less than 0.8 times the original formation pressure. The injected water temperature should not be lower than the original reservoir temperature. Compared with the current development technology policy, after 15 years, the case of optimized constant pressure gradient extraction increased 532,000 tons of oil, and improved the stage recovery by 2.5%. After the application of the case, the natural decline rate decreases, water cut increase rate slows down, and better development effect is achieved.

TI  - Offshore Exploration in the Argentine Sea
AB  - The Argentine Sea is one of the largest and less explored regions of the planet. It has a potential of billions of barrels of oil to be investigated. The country's great challenge is to verify and develop this potential in the framework of narrow transitions to alternative energies and decarbonization. For unlocking this hydrocarbon potential, a Play Analysis methodology was applied to the entire Argentinian margin. The large volume of resources detected (+30.000 MBOE) is now being associated with scientific evidence related to the opening of the south Atlantic and recent discoveries on the conjugate south African margin. Besides, a series of actions such as intensive 2D seismic acquisition in deep waters, oceanographic surveys, and the extension of the limit of the continental platform, allowed the country to launch in 2019 its first exploration bidding round since the 1960's. The bidding round was a success in terms of Major energy companiesâ€™ interest and investment, ending with the granting of 18 exploration permits. Commitments assumed by companies in these exploration areas are mainly the acquisition of seismic data during a first exploration period. Then, a drill or drop decision must be made to pass to a second period. However, recent changes in Regulations for environmental permits, together with a greater social environmental awareness, led YPF as the National Oil Company, to develop diffusion activities to get the social license to operate. One of the requirements that new regulations introduced, are mandatory public hearings to find out the opinion of the society for each offshore activity. In the first offshore public hearing, only 3% of participants supported the activity but, after strong diffusion effort, the following public hearing registered a 63% of approval. This new context shows that environmental and social demands are a new challenge for the offshore oil & gas activities within the framework of energy transitions and carbon neutrality. It is a priority to respond the concerns of society and demonstrate that the activity could fit in the transition while generating and developing jobs, industries, technical and scientific knowledge, and favorably impacting the economic and social fabric of the country.

TI  - Elevating Offshore Operation Frontliner Critical Position Competency Through Customize Capability Framework
AB  - This paper describes the Competency Development Framework developed by an Upstream Organization to provide assurance that its critical frontline positions, including Operations Installation Managers (OIMs) and Production/Maintenance Supervisors (PSMS), acquire essential technical, functional, and leadership competencies. The framework outlines a comprehensive career progression path from technician/technical executive to PS/MS and then OIM, with three key components: pre-requisites prior to appointment into position, structured competency development and assurance programs while in position, and sustainment and standardization. To ensure the effectiveness of the framework, pre-requisites filter candidates to ensure they meet competency requirements and possess the right behavior and mindset. For instance, candidates must have relevant technical and industry experience, high HSE standards, and a leadership mindset to excel in their roles. The structured competency development programs are fit for purpose, focusing on hands-on experiential learning, and certified by internationally recognized bodies. They involve close guidance from experienced seniors, who provide feedback and mentorship to develop leadership competencies, among other technical and functional competencies. To ensure the competencies acquired are sustained post-certification, the sustainment and standardization component of the framework ensures standard practices across fields. This component involves ensuring that the best practices learned during the competency development programs are shared, cascaded, and sustained across different fields. The competency development framework is reviewed and continuously enhanced to address evolving business requirements. Since the implementation of the OIM and PSMS Framework in 2018, Upstream has provided a sufficient pool of certified and highly capable OIM successors, allowing senior OIMs to be promoted to other senior positions within the organization or to replace retiring OIMs. The OIM BTEC program has produced over a hundred graduates, while the PSMS BTEC program has produced over three hundred graduates. Among these graduates, approximately one-third have advanced to senior positions within the Upstream Organization, while the others continue to excel in OIM and PSMS positions in Upstream. The organization is assured of a talent funneling ratio of 1:3, ensuring that there are prepared individuals to assume OIM and PSMS positions in the event of mobility or attrition within the organization. In conclusion, the Competency Development Framework has provided assurance that critical frontline positions acquire essential competencies, ensuring high standards in HSE and technical capabilities, commercial savviness, and strong leadership values. The framework has ensured the development of a sufficient pool of OIMs for the industry, thereby addressing the potential shortage of skilled personnel in the field. The framework is a valuable guide for the O&G industry to develop similar structured frameworks for developing OIM capabilities, ensuring standard practice and leadership across the industry.

TI  - Integrated Solution to Tackle Sand Production Using Inhouse Sand Agglomeration Technology: A Pilot in Offshore Malaysian Oilfield
AB  - Several oil fields in the Malaysian oilfields have experienced sand production issues, which caused a reduction in production. Moreover, if artificial lift systems such as ESP is installed, it can lead to frequent failures, which will have a significant impact on cost due to pump downtime. Mechanical solutions that are commonly used, such as sand screen and gravel packs, are suboptimal because they decrease inflow area and make optimization activities difficult. This paper describes an integrated solution that employs inhouse sand agglomeration chemical (SAC) technology and mechanical solution to address the sand production problem from laboratory to pilot in an offshore oil well. Extensive laboratory tests confirmed the SAC viability for sand production in Field-S. A pilot well candidate was selected based on a history of frequent well interventions due to sand production in the past, as well as the completeness of core samples, mineralogy data, and fluid samples. The test was conducted with an actual downhole sand sample and a sand screen, while flowrate and pressure were monitored. Produced sand was collected for particle size distribution measurement and scanning electron microscope, static and dynamic thermal stability tests, chemical and agglomerated sand particles were aged at downhole temperature and pressure. During pilot, the SAC was injected near the wellbore, and then a sand screen was installed, with post-injection monitoring. A novel multipolymers chemical concept SAC was proposed, which provides larger agglomerates of grains sands and stronger bond strength between particles, resulting in longer agglomerated sand particle longevity. Meanwhile, the sand screen was installed, and injection was done simply with a bullhead and no squeeze required. After applying SAC in the laboratory, a strong sand agglomeration was observed on the produced sand sample. The SAC can reduce the non-uniformity of agglomerated sand particles, lowering the risk of screen plugging and improving permeability. It also reduces the risk of sand screen plugging and opens more flow channels for hydrocarbon to flow through. This first pilot was successfully executed in a well at Field-S. The knowledge and experience gathered during this first pilot will be utilized as a reference for future replication to other candidates in the Malaysian oilfields with similar issue.

TI  - Unlocking Stranded Marginal Gas Fields in Malaysia with Low CAPEX Approach
AB  - Vestigo Petroleum Sdn. Bhd. (VPSB) has been awarded the right to develop and produce gas fields via a Petroleum Sharing Contract in offshore Peninsular Malaysia. The contract area consists of undeveloped Field T, Field I and Field B integrated late life asset. The undeveloped Field T and Field I marginal gas fields lie within 60km from existing Field B production hub. The production comes from gas dominant Field B, a producing field that is in decline and of which VPSB assumed operatorship in 2017. The immediate business driver is rapid monetization of the asset via tapping into nearby potential marginal gas fields. To enable this, low CAPEX and rapid development with fast investment return are required. Among the undeveloped gas fields, Field T was identified to anchor the development as it carries significant discovered gas volume. However, majority of the gas volume comes with H2S, and CO2 content which is beyond sales gas specification. Therefore, inter and intra fields blending were considered. Owing to the complexity of Field T that is dependent on other fields to provide blending medium, it is crucial to outline sequencing, timing of the other gas fields appraisal and development to optimize the development. To start with, Field T development from a wellhead platform tied back to existing VPSB processing facilities via a 60km long pipeline was the identified concept. A standardized wellhead platform, batch drilling and fit purpose well design in conjunction with application of Zap-Lok, mechanical connection technology in pipeline and sharing of operation cost with existing facilities led to cost effective development. This is the first application of Zap-Lok technology offshore Malaysia. The deployment of VPSB standard wellhead platform enabled rapid field development, with platform installed in less than eleven (11) months after project approval. All five (5) development wells were batch drilled to penetrate multiple stacked reservoirs and completed monobore to accommodate selective bottom-up perforation. These monobore wells either commingled minor reservoirs within similar pressure regime or selectively perforated at major reservoirs only for production to meet committed gas rate. This also ensures not to jeopardize major reservoirs gas reserves and reservoir management plan. Future developments are being planned to duplicate the success of Field T development to other identified marginal fields to drive cost reductions over time with higher efficiency.

TI  - Drilling Offshore Wells with High-Performance Water-Based Mud (HPWBM) in Extreme High-Pressure/High-Temperature (HP/HT) Conditions
AB  - During drilling of three exploration wells challenging conditions were encountered including temperatures up to 180Â°C, interbedded highly reactive shales/silts, formation pressures which required Mud Weights (MW) up to 2.35 SG and narrow margin between pore and fracture gradients, posing a host of technical, logistical, and cost challenges to Eni activities. These conditions required an accurate drilling fluids design to maximize operational efficiency and to minimize the risks related to such an extreme environment. Technical demands were particularly critical since the reactive shale formations had historically proved to be difficult to inhibit when drilled with Water Based Mud (WBM) exhibiting swelling, tight hole, sticky wireline runs, bit-balling and accretion that could have resulted, among other issues, in low penetration rates (ROP). The formation nature coupled with Equivalent Circulation Density (ECD) constraints due to the high mud weight required to cope with high pore pressure, which also caused high mud rheology readings were therefore the main limits to be overcome to achieve the well objectives. A tailored drilling fluid program was thus proposed which consisted of an inhibitive High-Performance Water Based Mud (HPWBM) that could be converted to a High Temperature-High Performances Water Based Mud (HT-HPWBM) while drilling, to cross the deeper and hotter sections of the well. This fluid was specifically engineered and optimized after each well in order to contain high concentration of a combination of monovalent salts to guarantee inhibition and reduce solids loading, dedicated polyamine shale inhibitor and fluid loss additives to minimize API/High-Pressure High-Temperature (HP/HT) filtrate and filter cake thickness with the aim to reduce shale water invasion throughout the drilling campaign, graphite to minimizes fluid invasion and fracture propagation and Rate Of Penetration (ROP) enhancer continuously injected using dedicated pumps to act as anti-balling and anti-accretion additive. In addition to lab testing campaign and mud formulations optimization several drilling operations practices and equipment were introduced on the project taking in account the lessons learned gained by previous wells and experience on similar HP/HT fields contributing on the optimization of drilling performance achieved well by well. The drilling targets were achieved safely, on time and with good overall fluid performance which either reduced or eliminated many of the challenges seen in offset wells, including: no barite sag, rheology stability, and stable long-term mud properties and wellbore conditions even during extended formation logs acquisitions. This paper covers the design, execution and accomplishments of the water-based drilling fluids employed on three HP/HT wells drilled, together with all the lessons learned captured, highlighting the evolution of these systems to reach a step-change in terms of performances in such a harsh environment.

TI  - Corrugation-like Triboelectric Nanogenerators Integrated Buoys for Wave Energy Harvesting
AB  - Marine buoys, as the nodes of the marine monitoring system, play a vital role in monitoring marine activities, which can collect hydro-meteorological information for marine scientific research, offshore oil development, and construction of marine ports. However, sustainable and cost-effective power supply for marine buoys equipped with electrical devices is still a challenge. In this paper, the corrugation-like triboelectric nanogenerator (C-TENG) integrated with marine buoys was proposed, aiming at harvesting wave energy and powering marine buoys. The C-TENG consisting of corrugated plates, corrugation-like channels, aluminum electrodes, barrier sheets, flat plates, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) pellets, was capable of effectively converting the energy harnessed from waves into electricity. As a result of the ocean wave's excitement, the sliding contact between the PTFE pellets and the aluminum electrode produced electron transfer via the triboelectrification effect and electrostatic induction. With the unique corrugation-like channels, the output of the devices was in the same phase, avoiding the electrical loss resulting from rectification. Furthermore, the power density of the 5 layers parallel-connected C-TENG units reached 21.95 W/m3, which was approximately 300% higher than the previous tower-like TENG. The experimental results prove that the proposed C-TENG may provide a possible solution for wave energy harvesting and marine buoy powering.  Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Co-operative Control of BESS and Wind Turbines for Heavy Motor Starting on Industrial Isolated Grids
AB  - Sustainable low emission offshore oil and gas platforms (OOGPs) are expected to comprise a lower number of gas turbine generators (GTGs) and offshore wind turbines integrated with battery energy storage systems (BESS). This combination faces challenges with the traditional platform loads, i.e. heavy induction motors (IMs), that are started directly on-line. They draw high inrush currents resulting in voltage sags affecting other loads connected to the common bus. These sags could activate a Low-voltage ride-through control scheme on wind turbines (WTs) and dissipate the generated wind power into a dynamic brake resistor (DBR) while regulating the grid voltage. Improper control coordination of the GTGs, WTs, and BESS could either fail or delay the motor start-up, with a detrimental impact on the industrial process. Considering the above, this paper proposes a Cooperative Control (CoC) strategy of BESS, WTs, and GTGs for the efficient starting of heavy motors with reduced loss of generated wind power. The proposed control strategy is simulated utilizing MATLAB for a real industrial scenario, and the results are discussed. Â© 2023 The Korean Institute of Power Electronics.

TI  - An Underwater AUV Charging Platform Based on a Novel Hybrid Energy System and Its Energy Scheduling Strategy
AB  - To meet the automatic energy replenishment requirements of underwater AUVs, This paper presents a novel underwater self-service charging platform for AUVs. The platform adopts a new integrated architecture of power generation, energy storage, and power charging. For the requirements of the underwater environment, a closed hydrogen oxygen fuel cell system is used on the power generation side. Furthermore, to improve the power generation capacity of the platform, the ocean current power generation system is introduced into the system. On the energy storage side, high specific energy lithium-ion batteries are used. In the power charging subsystem, two sets of charging devices are designed to provide energy for two AUVs simultaneously. And wireless energy transmission method are adopted into the charging devices which can effectively improve charging reliability. DC power supply network is designed to improve platform charging efficiency, and master slave control strategy is utilized to achieve DC bus stability, while each power generation source connecting to the DC bus. For the proposed new charging platform, a new energy scheduling strategy is proposed. The proposed scheduling strategy effectively improves the energy utilization efficiency of the platform while maintaining DC bus voltage stability. The new platform is introduced and modeled in the paper while the energy scheduling algorithm is derived. The simulation of the platform and the energy scheduling strategy is carried out which verifies the effectiveness of the underwater charging platform and scheduling strategy.  Â© 2023 IEEE.

TI  - Preliminary Investigation of a Multi-MW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Power Plant to be Installed on Board a Cruise Ship
AB  - As the use of both clean energy technologies and alternative fuels in the maritime sector is spreading, studies dealing with the installation of multi-MW power generation plants on board ships have been increasing. Considering this, the present work proposes a 12 MW Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) to be installed on board a cruise ship of about 175000 gross tonnes, 345 m length, and powered by Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). It is supposed that the SOFC generates electrical energy and provides part of the thermal power demand by integrating a heat recovery system. A zero-dimensional (0D) Aspen Plus model has been developed to optimize the onboard layout and to predict the performance of the integrated power plant. Specific parameters, such as the fuel utilisation factor, the pre-heated air temperature, the anodic recycle flow rate, and the exhaust gas temperature, have been manipulated to evaluate the overall efficiency of the integrated power plant under different operating conditions. The model has been validated by comparing the results obtained with data from literature and commercial SOFC modules. A layout configuration of the SOFC plant is suggested and the performances are investigated by varying the efficiency in the range of 60-40%. Â© 2023, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

TI  - PORT INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES FOR OFFSHORE WIND AND COMMERCIAL FISHING
AB  - For the past 21 years and counting, the Port of New Bedford has been Americaâ€™s highest grossing commercial fishing port and the epicenter of the industry on the East Coast. According to one recent study, the Port generates â€“ largely through fishing, seafood processing, and related businesses â€“ over $11 billion in economic output and supports nearly 7,000 jobs. The Port is the primary economic engine of Southeastern Massachusetts. As a means of diversifying the regionâ€™s economic base, New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell and his Administration have worked for nearly a decade to position New Bedford to become the leader in offshore wind. New Bedford is now in a highly advantageous position to support the emergence of the American offshore wind industry. It is the closest industrial port to the Massachusetts and Rhode Island Wind Energy Areas, the largest cluster of wind energy areas on the East Coast with the acreage to support development of 14 GW of offshore wind power. As a result, the Port of New Bedford has the distinction of being the first U.S. port to host the marshalling and construction of a commercial-scale offshore wind development project. This effort requires a great deal of preparation, investment, and planning, much of which is well underway. The goal of the New Bedford Port Authority is to promote development that allows both commercial fishing and offshore wind industries to thrive. This paper discusses the various public and private infrastructure investments in the Port. These investments are creating new bulkhead and terminal space as well as rehabilitating derelict waterfront properties. Because New Bedford Harbor is a Superfund site, most of these infrastructure developments are permitted through the State Enhanced Remedy (SER) process. This process enables projects that meet specific criteria through the Record of Decision to be permitted within weeks rather than months. Several public and private projects permitted through the SER process are, by necessity, interdependent. Copyright 2023, The Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers.

TI  - An Innovative Set of Tools for a Sustainable and Safe Offshore Pipelaying
AB  - Offshore pipelay is a complex activity that is subject to some risks due to the challenging operating scenario. The risks may concern the workers during pipes handling, the subsea environment that may be subject to huge seabed rectification works and the integrity of the pipeline. This paper will present the technological roadmap developed by Saipem to implement a more sustainable pipelay operation, focusing on the safety and integrity of the environment, personnel and pipeline. Four innovative tools will be described. The Hands Free Lifting Beam (HFLB) is a system for automatic offshore lifting of pipes, removing human intervention and keeping the workers away from the line of fire. The AFT (Anti Flooding Tool) is a remotely operated tool for pipeline protection from flooding in case of a wet buckle occurrence during lay. The I.A.U (Integrated Acoustic Unit) can perform a safe and nonintrusive, continuous piggability monitoring of the pipeline catenary during lay. The UCB (Underwater Cold Bending) is a solution for crossing sharp slope transition avoiding seabed preparation work and associated environmental impacts. The HFLB grabs and lifts the pipes from cargo barge to pipelay vessel under the control of the operator located in a safe area. The AFT runs inside the laid pipeline during the entire lay, remaining in the safe section already laid (free from possible buckling running effects); it automatically plugs the pipe in case of an accidental flooding event, keeping safe the portion of the pipeline already laid. The I.A.U exploits the acoustic reflectometry and can be integrated with the ILUC (Internal Line Up Clamp) on firing line. It is an alternative to Mechanical Buckle Detector (MBD) which is an intrusive system with associated risks for the pipeline like wire break and loss of the device inside the pipeline, device stacking and possible damage of internal coating during pulling. The UCB is a combination of a new installation method and new subsea bending machine ROV operated, to realize cold bends safely and effectively on the pipeline profile without interrupting the continuous pipelay operation. The UCB can realize the bends underwater, directly on the pipeline catenary when the pipe joint to be bent is landing or close to landing on the seabed, reducing the operational cost while increasing the sustainability. The presented tools can pave the way for safer worker operations during pipe handling (with HFLB); for de-risking the flooding of laid pipeline in case of wet buckle event avoiding the use of a dewatering spread and chemicals for seawater treating, reducing costs and environmental impact (with AFT); for de Â© 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - SIIBED: Subsea Ice Interaction Barriers to Energy Development â€“ Overview
AB  - The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the Subsea Ice Interaction Barriers to Energy Development (SIIBED) project including work on acceptance criteria used in finite element analysis (FEA), physical modelling and risk analysis activities. The overall structure of the SIIBED program and the relationship between the various tasks is presented. SIIBED is a continuation of two previous projects funded by Energy Research & Innovation Newfoundland and Labrador (ERINL): Alternatives to Flowline Trenching (AFT) and Alternatives to Weak Links (AWL). The SIIBED scope was expanded to include subsea cables, reflecting the interest in moving towards electrification of offshore operations. Numerical modelling of iceberg interaction with rigid pipelines, flexible flowlines and cables requires an understanding of elastic/plastic stiffness and stress/deformation limit states. This paper reviews existing technologies, industry standards and best practices. The behavior of rigid pipes in an ice grounding environment is fairly well understood and was reviewed in relation to applications supporting developments in the Beaufort Sea. In contrast, the construction of flexible flowlines is much more complex and variable, and firm guidelines on design strain limits are lacking for the application considered here. Subsea cables are even less well understood. When considering subsea cables and the adoption of limit state design criteria, the model of failure consequences was examined in the context of approximately a 15 second ice-pipe-soil interaction before the iceberg passes over-top. Under loading, the three conductors in an AC cable must maintain separation to prevent electrical arcing. Insulation around a single conductor DC cable must remain intact. It has been observed that, unlike steel pipes that ovalize when compressed restricting access for pigging as well as loss of strength integrity, the cables (particularly the insulation around conductors), bounce back to the original shape. The potential loss of conductivity could not be tested. If cables bounce back, then to prevent arcing, a cable could be de-energized for the short period ice keel interaction and re-energized after the iceberg passes over-top. While a considerable understanding for modeling rigid pipelines against iceberg keel interaction exists, analysis of subsea cables is much less understood. These are, however, now necessary as the oil and gas industry transitions to a net zero carbon footprint or alternative energy sources (e.g. offshore wind power) are developed in ice prone regions. While more testing and verification work is needed, this work suggests Â© 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Update on the Challenges to Offshore Facility Decommissioning on the California Coast
AB  - The authors have been working with the challenges related to decommissioning facilities offshore California since 1996. In a 2018 OTC paper (OTC-28844-MS) they reviewed the challenges for offshore facility decommissioning in this region. This paper reviews the oil and gas platform decommissioning projects being conducted on the federal Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) offshore California and the decommissioning outlook for OCS platforms through the end of this decade. There are a total of 23 oil and gas platforms on the federal OCS offshore California which are submerged lands located more than three nautical miles from the coastline. The authors project that one-third of the 23 OCS platforms and one state water platform are likely to be decommissioned by the end of the decade, and at least 50 percent of the OCS platforms are likely to be removed by the middle of the next decade. Three of the eight OCS platforms being decommissioned, if fully removed, would each establish world water depth records for removing conventional steel platform jackets from the seafloor. The paper also describes the major technical, logistical, environmental, and regulatory challenges operators face in planning and conducting decommissioning projects offshore California.

TI  - Carbon emission allowance allocation based on a bi-level multi-objective model in maritime shipping
AB  - To mitigate carbon emissions from maritime shipping, this study investigates the strategies and performance of allocating carbon emission allowances (CEAs) with the cap-and-trade mechanism among shipping companies. Using a bi-level model solved by the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm based on Pareto solution set, the interactions between decisions of the government and shipping companies are well character-ized. The results of the benchmark scenario indicate that all shipping companies' optimal carbon emissions decrease annually during the planning period, and a larger company usually exhibits a better emission reduction performance. However, economic benefits of shipping companies and the society display an annually declining trend due to additional carbon emission reduction costs. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the decreasing carbon prices lead to more emissions, while the optimal total carbon emissions decrease as carbon reduction costs increase. These findings create implications for multiple stakeholders to formulate their own carbon emissions mitigation strategies under the cap-and-trade mechanism.

TI  - Mitigating stochastic uncertainty from weather routing for ships with wind propulsion
AB  - Reducing the shipping sector's contribution to climate change requires urgent emission reductions this decade. Both weather routing and wind propulsion offer immediate solutions, where combining sails with efficient routing amplifies the performance of each technology. However, while large emission savings are theoretically available, the impact of stochastic uncertainty from wind forecasts is unknown. Here, we present a novel approach that exploits fuel consumption calculations from over a thousand departures across three routes to characterise stochastic uncertainty. We show that routes with ideal wind conditions and long voyage times are most sensitive to uncertain forecast inputs, reducing savings from Flettner rotors and weather routing by up to 44\% when a priori weather routing strategies are used. This paper further shows how an adaptive weather routing strategy can be used as an accurate prediction tool to reduce uncertainty on all routes investigated, reliably amplifying carbon savings from Flettner rotors by between 1.16 and 2.48 times typical great circle route savings. Overall, this paper provides greater assurance around the previously estimated carbon savings that serves to strengthen confidence in a wind-assisted decarbonisation strategy and its potential to provide essential emission reductions this decade.

TI  - Decarbonising the Shipping Industry: A Status Report
AB  - Against the background of an escalating climate crisis, this article provides an overview of the present status of international regulatory efforts addressing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships. It does so by tracing the evolution of mitigation policies and regulations and examining their adequacy, practicability as well as equity and fairness. Its principal focus is on reducing GHG emissions from ships themselves as the most direct and effective approach to improving the shipping industry's climate profile. International shipping, as an intrinsically globally operating industry, ultimately requires consistency, if not uniformity, in regulation which only a global regime can provide. The article therefore focuses primarily on efforts by the international community at large, specifically by the International Maritime Organization, to respond to the climate crisis and to ensure that the shipping industry decarbonises in a timely as well just and fair manner.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon Sequestration after 20-Year Afforestation of Mangrove Plantations on Qi'ao Island, Southern China
AB  - Mangrove afforestation is considered an important measure in the ``natural-based solution{''} for mitigating climate warming through sequestering massive carbon (C) into vegetation biomass, yet how the planted mangrove species facilitate soil C sequestration remains unclear. Here, we investigated the stock, source, and fraction of soil organic carbon (SOC) over 1 m depth after 20-year afforestation of five mangrove pure plantations (Acrostichum aureum, Acanthus ilicifolius, Aegiceras corniculatum, Kandelia obovate, and Excoecaria agallocha) on Qi'ao Island, South China. The results showed that SOC stocks did not significantly differ among the five plantations, with an average value of 16.7 kg C m-2. Based on the two-end-member mixing model with plant-soil C stable isotope signatures, the autochthonous (mangrove-derived) C source accounted for 20.2-34.1\% of SOC but varied significantly among the plantations. The SOC stock in particulate fraction (1.2-2.0 g C kg-1) and mineral-associated fraction (14.3-16.0 g C kg-1) also significantly differed among the plantations. The similar SOC stock but different source contributions and C fractions among the plantations observed here may have important implications for mangrove afforestation to optimize stand structure and maximize C sequestration.

TI  - Legal pathways for China's blue carbon conservation: a perspective of synergizing ocean and climate rule of law
AB  - Blue carbon serves as a significant natural carbon sink and presents substantial opportunities for greenhouse gas mitigation actions. This study first elucidates the importance of blue carbon conservation and its basis in international law, and then analyzes the progress and shortcomings of China's efforts in blue carbon protection in the areas of legislation, enforcement, and judicial practices related to ocean governance and climate change mitigation. Finally, from the perspective of coordinating ocean and climate governance, this paper proposes legal pathways to improve blue carbon conservation. In terms of legislation, it advocates for the explicit inclusion of the legal concept of ``blue carbon{''} in the legal frameworks governing ocean and climate governance, and for the clarification of the legal status of ``blue carbon credits{''}. In terms of regulatory enforcement, it recommends developing a detailed implementation plan to integrate blue carbon into the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) system, designating a regulatory body for blue carbon trading, and establishing a multi-stakeholder governance mechanism involving government, market, and society. In the judicial realm, the paper suggests issuing judicial interpretations to clarify the scope, prerequisites, and implementation of ``purchasing blue carbon credit{''} to prevent such purchases from becoming a ``free pass{''} that could damage marine ecosystems

TI  - A standardized protocol for assessing the performance of automatic detection systems used in onshore wind power plants to reduce avian mortality
AB  - While wind power plants are an important contribution to the production of renewable energy to limit climate change, collision mortality from turbines is a danger for birds, including many protected species. To try to mitigate collision risks, automatic detection systems (ADSs) can be deployed on wind power plants; these work by detecting incoming birds using a detection/classification process and triggering a specific reaction (scaring off the bird or shutting down the turbine). Nonetheless, bird fatalities still occur at ADS-equipped wind power plants, which raises the question of the performance of these tools. To date, the lack of a transparent, peerreviewed experimental process to compare the performance of types of ADS has meant there is no robust protocol to assess these systems. With the aim of filling this gap, we developed two standardized protocols that provide objective and unbiased assessments of the performance of different types of ADS, based on their probability of detecting/classifying birds at risk of collision. Both protocols rely on precise 3D tracking of wild birds by human observers using a laser rangefinder, and the comparison of these tracks with those detected and recorded by an ADS. The first protocol evaluates a system's general performance, generating comparable data for all types of ADS. In this protocol, detection/classification probability is estimated conditional on several abiotic and biotic environmental factors such as bird size, distance from the target, the flight angle and azimuth of the bird, as well as weather conditions. The second protocol aims to verify that the performance of an ADS installed on a given wind power plant complies with its regulatory requirements. In this protocol, detection/classification probability is specifically estimated for a given target species at a given regulatory detection distance. This protocol also estimates the proportion of time an ADS is functional on site over a year, and the proportion of reaction orders successfully operated by wind turbines. These protocols have been field-tested and made publicly available for use by government agencies and wind power plant operators.

TI  - Effects of vortex rope formation in draft tube of reversible pump-turbine - A review
AB  - Reversible pump-turbines need to operate often at off-design operating conditions to stabilize the electric grid. These operating conditions cause hydraulic instabilities due to the development of vortex rope in the draft tube. The research and design communities of reversible pump-turbines are paying attention to this hydraulic instability being important in ensuring the stability and safety of the functioning of a pumped hydro storage plant. The objective of the study is to synthesise the existing research and to enhance the understanding of the mechanism of vortex rope formation, its associated pressure fluctuations and its mitigation strategies in reversible pump-turbines under different operating conditions. Such understanding is important for enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and lifespan of reversible pump-turbines by improving the design and optimisation of future reversible pump-turbine systems. The study identifies that the intensity of the vortex rope is highly sensitive to the residual angular momentum of water leaving the runner. The flow decelerates with an adverse pressure gradient, resulting in a flow reversal; thus, a stagnation zone is formed, which leads to vortex breakdown and the development of vortex rope in the draft tube. The rotating vortex rope causes pressure fluctuations in the draft tube which can lead to vibrations and structural fatigue failure of the unit. Further, the vortex rope in the draft tube brings the power swings in the pumped hydro storage plants. The study recommends different mitigation techniques to overcome the adverse effects of vortex rope formation and its associated pressure fluctuations. The implementation of geometrical and fluid mitigation techniques is essential to avoid conditions that favour the development of vortex rope and to reduce the pressure fluctuations in the draft tube.

TI  - Evaluation of stratigraphic adaptability for hydrate-based CO2 sequestration in marine clay-containing reservoirs
AB  - Geological sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in solid hydrate state beneath seafloor is an attractive option for mitigating global warming. However, as a representative geological factor in marine sediment, clay mineral still plays an ambiguous role in hydrate depositional behaviors and reservoir structural evolution, which provides an obstacle to accurately assessing the potential and security of marine CO2 sequestration. In this work, spatiotemporal hydrate distribution and sedimentary structure evolution in the presence of two typical clay minerals with different structures and properties were investigated by low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LNMR) technique. There was an inextricable interaction between clay-fluid migration and hydrate phase transition in porous sediments. Pore plugging owing to migration, agglomeration, and redeposition of unstable kaolinite (KIT) particles weakened final CO2 storage capacity by 10.3\% and exacerbated heterogeneous hydrate distribution. CO2 storage capacity in montmorillonite (MMT) system was significantly improved with a water conversion of 82.7\% for the high interaction potential between clay particles and favorable mass transfer conditions within the reservoir. However, clay minerals accelerated CO2 hydrate destabilization and disrupted the initial water distribution and pore structure. Migration of MMT fluid with high viscosity and gel property during hydrate phase transition resulted in a complex pore evolution and irreversible sedimentary skeleton deformation, providing an effective warning for field implementation of geological carbon sequestration. The findings expand the understanding of pore-scale interaction between clay minerals and gas hydrates, and provide valuable support for stratigraphic adaptability evaluation of CO2 sequestration in marine sediments.

TI  - Coordinated intelligent control strategy and power management for marine gas turbine under pulsed load using optimized neural network
AB  - Faced with the challenges of potentially irreversible damage due to instantaneous large pulsed power loads onboard, considering all-electric ship's small power grid capacity and complex gas turbine system, this study proposes a coordinated intelligent control strategy. It utilizes multi-objective optimization neural network to control a validated 20 MW ship three-shaft gas turbine, ensuring global optimization tailored to pulsed load variations. Research findings reveal that the gas turbine efficiency at the design point is 32.3 \%, with a steadystate error within 2.8 \% and a maximum steady time error of 3.4 s, demonstrating acceptable accuracy. Under slope-type pulsed load of 20 MW change in 5s, the proposed control strategy effectively manages speed while utilizing the energy storage system to smooth load inputs. It is worth noting that, increasing the fuel flow rate to 1.28 kg/s and inlet guide vane to 5.8 degrees reduces overshoot by 0.7 \% and rotor steady time by 15.4 s. Under transient-type pulsed load of 10 MW back and forth change in 5s, the coordinated inlet guide vane control strategy mitigates surge margin and exhaust temperature issues. Adjusting the fuel flow to 1.17 kg/s and inlet guide vane to 9.96 degrees enables the gas turbine to operate within safety boundaries, reducing rotor speed overshoot by 0.4 \% and steady time by 6.1 s. Importantly, the optimized control strategy without energy storage system provides faster and safer dynamic regulation and power transmission for ship acceleration processes under radar load. However, considering only the coordinated strategy of the fuel sub-control loop, it is advisable to avoid compressor surge and over-temperature protection for electromagnetic ejection load scenarios. The research results will lay a valuable technical foundation for the intelligent control and smooth power transfer of the allelectric ship gas turbine power system with pulse loads in the extreme missions of ships in the future.

TI  - Promoting effects of aluminum addition on chlorophyll biosynthesis and growth of two cultured iron-limited marine diatoms
AB  - Aluminum (Al) may play a role in the ocean's capacity for absorbing atmospheric CO2 via influencing carbon fixation, export, and sequestration. Aluminum fertilization, especially in iron (Fe)-limited high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll ocean regions, has been proposed as a potential CO2 removal strategy to mitigate global warming. However, how Al addition would influence the solubility and bioavailability of Fe as well as the physiology of Fe-limited phytoplankton has not yet been examined. Here, we show that Al addition (20 and 100 nM) had little influence on the Fe solubility in surface seawater and decreased the Fe bio-uptake by 11-22\% in Fe-limited diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii in Fe-buffered media. On the other hand, the Al addition significantly increased the rate of chlorophyll biosynthesis by 45-60\% for Fe-limited T. weissflogii and 81-102\% for Fe-limited Thalassiosira pseudonana, as well as their cell size, cellular chlorophyll content, photosynthetic quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm) and growth rate. Under Fe-sufficient conditions, the Al addition still led to an increased growth rate, though the beneficial effects of Al addition on chlorophyll biosynthesis were no longer apparent. These results suggest that Al may facilitate chlorophyll biosynthesis and benefit the photosynthetic efficiency and growth of Fe-limited diatoms. We speculate that Al addition may enhance intracellular Fe use efficiency for chlorophyll biosynthesis by facilitating the superoxide-mediated intracellular reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II). Our study provides new evidence and support for the iron-aluminum hypothesis.

TI  - Model experimental studies on active heave compensation control strategy for electric-driven offshore cranes
AB  - Ship-mounted heave compensation offshore cranes are indispensable for isolating connected payloads from the support vessel during lifting operations under harsh sea conditions. In this paper, an innovative adaptive robust control strategy is presented for the electric-driven active heave compensation (EDAHC) system, combining an equivalent model predictive control (EMPC) method with a bias proportional integral derivative (BPID) framework to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of wave-induced heave motions from the support vessel on the suspended payload. Building upon the inherent field-oriented control in the permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), the BPID-based control structure is introduced, motivated by its prompt responsiveness and robust resistance against model discrepancies and irregular disturbances. Facilitated by a torque compensation mechanism, the EMPC-based control scheme, synthesized with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)-based heave motion prediction algorithm, is subsequently developed to achieve nonlinear friction deadzone correction and adaptive regulation of BPID parameters, thereby ensuring optimal performance of the EDAHC system within specified state and input constraints. Comparative experimental tests conducted on a scaled EDAHC testbed validate the superior capabilities of the proposal in station-keeping, position tracking, constraint satisfaction, and robustness against parametric uncertainties.

TI  - Turning the ships around: The Russia-Ukraine conflict reshapes the US LNG maritime transportation network
AB  - Energy exports are considered a form of power. Following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US, as an emerging natural gas exporter, has strengthened energy transport with its allies. However, quantitative analysis of how geopolitical events influence the US's exercise of energy power remains an underexplored area. In this study, we used Automatic Identification System data and US ally relationship data to explore the spatial impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on global liquefied natural gas (LNG) maritime transport and changes in US transport patterns before and after the conflict. The results show that the conflict has tightened US alliances. Transatlantic shipping activity increased the most during the time of soaring global LNG prices, with US treaty allies' coastal areas becoming the most active. Owing to the rerouting of transport ships, traffic through the Panama Canal decreased while Strait of Dover traffic increased, significantly enhancing the US' transport route coverage to core treaty allies. Our results highlight the potential for future conflict events and emphasize the need to enhance global energy security resilience; prevent LNG from becoming a political tool; and design secure, efficient, and resilient national energy policies.

TI  - Optimization of shipping freight forwarding services considering consumer rebates under the impact of carbon tax policy
AB  - Maritime carbon emissions, contributing to approximately 2.89% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, have prompted governments to actively promote a low-carbon shift in the freight forwarding sector. The effect of carbon tax implementation on guiding freight forwarders towards offering more eco-friendly freight forwarding services and facilitating a low-carbon transition remains unclear. This study categorizes freight forwarding services models based on delivery speed, ranging from fast to slow, and environmental friendliness, from low to high. It examines scenarios involving a singular carbon tax and consumer rebates, establishing a freight forwarder model without carbon tax constraints (N-T model), a singular carbon tax model for freight forwarders (C-T model), and a combined carbon tax-consumer rebate model (C-C model). The findings suggest that carbon tax pressures from regulatory bodies ultimately affect consumers; thus, under tax cost pressures, freight forwarders must adapt their shipping strategies. A shift towards more eco-friendly freight forwarding services occurs if the rate of demand growth is less than the increase in fixed delivery costs, and an optimal tax rate can drive this shift. Conversely, when the perceived rebate difference between any two services surpasses a certain threshold, eco-friendly freight forwarding services are consistently favored. In the absence of such conditions, a well-designed carbon tax policy is essential to steer freight forwarders toward reducing carbon emissions. Â© 2024 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Prediction and assessment of marine fisheries carbon sink in China based on a novel nonlinear grey Bernoulli model with multiple optimizations
AB  - The vigorous development of marine fisheries carbon sinks (MFCS) has become a momentous pathway to mitigate global warming and effectively cope with the climate crisis. Deservedly, based on clarifying mechanism of carbon sequestration, this paper designs a research paradigm for predicting and evaluating the potential of MFCS. Specifically, a novel nonlinear grey Bernoulli model, namely MFCSNGBM(1,1), is proposed by innovatively mining the original data law through adaptive cumulative series and introducing the compound Simpson formula to optimize background values. More precisely, we utilize a heuristic Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm to find the best power index, which enhances the adaptability. To prove usefulness and robustness of MFCSNGBM(1,1) model, yields of seven common shellfishes (oyster, clam, mussel, scallop, razor clam, bloody clam, and snail) and three main algae (kelp, pinnatifid undaria, and laver) are predicted and compared with six competing models. Based on prediction results, new model has the most accurate predictions, with all prediction errors being <10 \%, and thus can achieve effective prediction of shellfish and algae production from 2022 to 2025. Further, the capacity and potential of MFCS in China are scientifically evaluated using a removable carbon sink model, considering various yield levels and biological parameters of shellfish and algae. The assessment results show that during the sample period, China's marine fisheries carbon sinks steadily increased with an annual growth rate of 57,000 tons. From 2022 to 2025, with support of policy of MFCS and improvement of disaster prevention and mitigation capacity, the potential of MFCS will be further released. The growth rate of MFCS will be increased to 94,000 tons per year, and its overall scale is expected to reach 2,198,245 tons by 2025, equivalent to fixing 8.06 million tons of CO2. The carbon sink's economic value is significantly estimated to be over 400 billion yuan.

TI  - CO2 foam to enhance geological storage capacity in hydrocarbon reservoirs
AB  - Geological CO2 storage is an emerging topic in energy and environmental community, which is, as a commonly-accepted sense, considered a powerful approach to mitigate the global carbon emissions during the transition to net-zero. The geological media initially considered cover the saline aquifers, oil and gas reservoirs, coal beds, and potentially basalts. Up to now only the first two choices have been proven to be the most capable storage sites and successfully implemented at pilot/commercial scales. Here, novel strategies were proposed for the first time, by synthesizing and utilizing new high-dryness CO2 foam, to enhance geological CO2 storage capacity in oil and gas reservoirs. As a major storage site, the oil and gas reservoirs ranked only second to the saline aquifer, due to their huge underground spaces, and more importantly, spontaneous economic benefits by injecting CO2 for geological storage. However, at any development stage, particularly late stage with high water cut, CO2 injection usually tends to cause gas channeling and therefore result in low-efficient storage. In this paper, a series of dynamic evaluation experiments are carried out to investigate the effect of newly-synthesized high-dryness CO2 foam in oil and gas reservoirs. A comprehensive set of parameters, including the fluid production volume, rate, efficiency, pressure, porous media weight, water cut, mobility reduction factor, oil-gas-water ternary phase saturation, etc., are specifically analyzed. The lab results show that when the foam quality is 85 \%, the oil recovery performance and gas phase saturation reach their highest values, of 82.68 \% and 75.36 \%, respectively; meanwhile, the water consumption is at the lowest level, 43.88 g/mol, for the CO2 storage in oil and gas reservoirs. This indicates the synthesized high-dryness CO2 foam, attributed to its superb stability, modifies the mobility ratio, suppresses the viscous fingering, and finally results in higher oil recovery and more CO2 storage. Similar work has been done for the reservoirs with permeabilities from high to low levels. The study provides experimental evidences that suggest benefits from applying CO2 flooding in oil and gas reservoirs.

TI  - A robust investment decision to deploy bioenergy carbon capture and storage-exploring the case of Stockholm Exergi
AB  - The upscaling of novel carbon dioxide removal, such as bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS), to gigatonne scales is an urgent priority if global warming is to be limited to well below 2 degrees C. But political, economic, social, technological, environmental and regulatory uncertainty permeates BECCS projects and deters investors. To address this, we explore options to improve the robustness of BECCS deployment strategies in the face of multi-dimensional uncertainties. We apply Dynamic Adaptive Planning (DAP) through expert interviews and Robust Decision Making (RDM) through exploratory modelling, two decision making under deep uncertainty methods, to the case of Stockholm Exergi, an early mover aiming to deploy BECCS at a combined heat and power plant in the capital of Sweden. The main contributions of the research are to 1) illustrate how a quantification of robustness against uncertainty can support an investment decision to deploy BECCS 2) comprehensively cover uncertain vulnerabilities and opportunities of deploying BECCS, and 3) identify critical scenarios and adaptations to manage these uncertainties. The main conclusions are: investing in BECCS is relatively robust if assessing performance across many scenarios and if comparing the worst-cases of either investing, or not doing so. Not investing could miss out on up to euro 3.8 billion in terms of net present value. The critical uncertainties of BECCS can be managed by strengthening biomass sustainability strategies and by gaining support for negative emission trading regulation on carbon markets, e.g., voluntary or Paris Agreement Article 6. Even in vulnerable scenarios of average electricity prices above 82 euro/MWh, if trading regulation is implemented before 2030 and if negative emission prices exceed 151 euro/CO2, investing in BECCS performs better than not doing so in 96\% of cases. We suggest that facility-level parameters and cost-reductions are of little importance for BECCS investments and upscaling. It is regulatory certainty of operating revenues, e.g., through negative emission markets, that needs to be provided by policymakers.

TI  - Can coastal and marine carbon dioxide removal help to close the emissions gap? Scientific, legal, economic, and governance considerations
AB  - In this Policy Bridge, we present the key issues regarding the safety, efficacy, funding, and governance of coastal and marine systems in support of climate change mitigation. Novel insights into the likely potential of these systems for use in mitigating excess carbon dioxide emissions are presented. There may be potential for coastal blue carbon and marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) actions to impact climate change mitigation significantly over the rest of the 21st century, particularly post 2050. However, governance frameworks are needed urgently to ensure that the potential contribution from coastal and ocean systems to climate change mitigation can be evaluated properly and implemented safely. Ongoing research and monitoring efforts are essential to ensure that unforeseen side effects are identified and corrective action is taken. The co-creation of governance frameworks between academia, the private sector, and policymakers will be fundamental to the safe implementation of mCDR in the future. Furthermore, a radical acceleration in the pace of development of mCDR governance is needed immediately if it is to contribute significantly to the removal of excess carbon dioxide emissions by the latter half of this century. To what extent large-scale climate interventions should be pursued is a decision for policymakers and wider society, but adaptive legal, economic, policy, research, and monitoring frameworks are needed urgently to facilitate informed decision-making around any implementation of mCDR in the coming decades. Coastal and ocean systems cannot be relied upon to deliver significant carbon dioxide removal until further knowledge of specific management options is acquired and evaluated.

TI  - Experimental studies on CO2 sequestration via enhanced rock weathering in seawater: Insights for climate change mitigation strategies in coastal and open ocean environments
AB  - Enhanced weathering (EW) of ultramafic rocks from the Muslim Bagh Ophiolite, Pakistan, has been studied in laboratory experiments to explore carbon sequestration as a climate change mitigation strategy for coastal and open sea environments. The research focused on a cost-effective ex situ experiment to examine the effects of EW reaction pathways arising from the interactions among rock powder, seawater and CO2. The experimental filtrates from different milled peridotite samples exhibit a decrease in the Mg/Ca ratio as the specific surface area increases, which accelerates reaction rates. This suggests that the leached Mg from the original rock may have been consumed in the formation of brucite, serpentine and carbonates during EW. Similar reaction pathways are also responsible for the chemical alterations observed in amphibolite, albeit to varying degrees. On the other hand, the experimental residues showed an increase in loss on ignition compared to the original rock, indicating that EW has facilitated the incorporation of H2O and CO2 into secondary mineral structures through various reaction pathways, leading to the formation of brucite, serpentine and carbonates. Thermal gravimetric analysis of the experimental residues confirms the presence of these minerals based on their decomposition temperatures. Additionally, XRD analysis identified a range of carbonates in the residues of both peridotite and amphibolite samples, validating the occurrence of carbonation reactions. SEM images reveal textural changes in both samples, supporting the formation of secondary minerals through EW, consistent with observations from the petrographic study of untreated samples. Control experiments on CO2 absorption in seawater showed a decrease in pH, highlighting ocean acidification from increased CO2 emissions. However, when rock powder was added to the seawater-CO(2 )mixture, the pH increased. This suggests that the EW of ultramafic rock powders can sequester CO(2 )while raising seawater pH through the formation of secondary minerals. This research could serve as an analog for EW applications, considering the worldwide abundance of ultramafic rocks and the availability of coastal and open ocean environments. However, further research is required to understand the behavior of other elements and their impacts on ocean chemistry in EW processes before applying CO2 sequestration strategies.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions from rotating biological contactors combined with hybrid constructed wetlands treating polluted river
AB  - The rotating biological contactors combined with hybrid constructed wetlands (R-HCWs) has promising treatment performance, however, concerns persisted regarding greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. In this study, GHGs in the R-HCWs was evaluated, and results revealed that R-HCWs facilitated nitrogen conversion and provided alternating oxygen environments, thereby promoting the reduction of N2O and CH4 emissions. Therefore, the comprehensive global warming potential (8.7 +/- 2.7 g CO2-eq<middle dot>m(-3)<middle dot>d(-1)) for handling unit volume of river water was low, thus, greater ecological benefits were achieved. The relative abundance of functional microorganisms such as Bacillus, Acinetobacter, Nitrospira and norank\_f\_\_norank\_o\_\_SBR1031, increased due to warm season, which promoted the nitrogen cycle and N2O emission reduction. Anammox and denitrifying bacteria showed significantly correlated with N2O and CH4 emissions (p < 0.01). This study provides valuable insights for the potential adoption of biological and ecological integrated treatment approach optimized for improving water and mitigating GHGs emissions.

TI  - Research on subject behavior choice of marine carbon sink projects under risk conditions
AB  - Marine carbon sink projects are important carriers for the development and utilization of marine carbon sink resources. The risk factors existing in the development process of marine carbon sink projects will significantly affect the behavior of the project subject, and then affect whether or not the project development can be conducted smoothly. Based on the evolutionary game method, this paper analyzes the behavior choice of each project subject under the risk condition, and explores the influencing factors that promote the change of its action probability. The results show the following: (1) Government subsidies can promote the development of marine carbon sink projects, but when the subsidies are too large, the government's willingness decreases, which may lead to significant changes in the decisions of relevant practitioners. (2) The government pays more attention to image improvement, is not sensitive to risks, and always chooses active subsidies. In the case that the risk poses a great threat to the project, the behavior strategies of the relevant practitioners and investors will influence each other, and both sides will determine the behavior strategies that can obtain more returns according to the other side's behavior decision. (3) The behavior of relevant practitioners and investors has an impact on the strategy of the demander. When the risk increases, the former has a greater impact on the demander's choice not to buy marine carbon sink. Relevant policy suggestions are put forward: (1) the government should flexibly adjust the subsidy mechanism; (2) the government should enhance the influence and popularity of marine carbon sink projects; and (3) the government should reduce the risks faced by the practitioners.

TI  - Nutrient-sensitive blue carbon dynamics model: A stochastic model for climate changes mitigation strategies
AB  - In light of the pressing issue of climate change and escalating global carbon emissions, this study investigates the efficacy of blue carbon ecosystems - namely, mangroves, sea-grasses, and tidal marshes - in carbon sequestration and climate mitigation. Focused on formulating actionable strategies, we examine these ecosystems' capacity to serve as natural carbon sinks under nutrient stress conditions. Utilizing a sophisticated mathematical model that incorporates both deterministic and stochastic elements, we simulate the carbon and nitrogen cycling within these ecosystems to capture the complexity and variability of natural processes. Our equilibrium analysis identifies critical thresholds at which these ecosystems optimally function as carbon sinks. Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis highlights key parameters such as nutrient availability and hydrodynamic conditions that significantly influence these thresholds. Results indicate that management practices focusing on nutrient regulation could enhance the carbon sequestration potential of these ecosystems. The insights derived from this research not only deepen our understanding of the role of blue carbon in climate mitigation but also offer concrete recommendations for policymakers and conservationists to optimize these natural resources in combating global warming.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of toxicity risks in the operation of ammonia-fueled tugboats
AB  - As efforts to conserve energy and reduce emissions in the global shipping industry intensify, people are constantly looking for new types of energy to replace traditional fuels. Ammonia is considered a novel energy source due to its potential for carbon-neutral shipping when produced from renewable energy sources and is extremely promising for the shipping industry. In this study, the fuel toxicity risk of ammonia-fueled ships under operating conditions was quantified for the first time. The assessment process adopts the traditional quantitative risk assessment (QRA) framework with accident probability calculations based on Bayesian theory, and the process of partial quantification of consequences also guides the delineation of safety zones. The results of the study suggest that ammonia-powered tugboats are at a higher risk of toxic accidents during operation than accidents at sea, but both are within the acceptable limits of current international maritime safety and environmental standards. Finally, safety measures and risk mitigation strategies are proposed based on the study results. This provides important support in safety risk analysis for the design, production and operation of subsequent ammonia fueled vessels and is of great theoretical and practical importance.

TI  - Enhancing CO2 storage and marine carbon sink based on seawater mineral carbonation
AB  - Human activities emitting carbon dioxide (CO2) have caused severe greenhouse effects and accelerated climate change, making carbon neutrality urgent. Seawater mineral carbonation technology offers a promising negative emission strategy. This work investigates current advancements in proposed seawater mineral carbonation technologies, including CO2 storage and ocean chemical carbon sequestration. CO2 storage technology relies on indirect mineral carbonation to fix CO2, involving CO2 dissolution, Ca/Mg extraction, and carbonate precipitation, optimized by adding alkaline substances or using electrochemical methods. Ocean chemical carbon sequestration uses natural seawater for direct mineral carbonation, enhanced by adding specific materials to promote carbonate precipitation and increase CO2 absorption, thus enhancing marine carbon sinks. This study evaluates these technologies' advantages and challenges, including reaction rates, costs, and ecological impacts, and analyzes representative materials' carbon fixation potential. Literature indicates that seawater mineral carbonation can play a significant role in CO2 storage and enhancing marine carbon sinks in the coming decades.

TI  - Carbon Storage Assessment under Mangrove Restoration of Dongzhai Harbor in Hainan Island, China
AB  - Mangrove restoration is recognized as an effective strategy for enhancing the carbon storage capacity of natural ecosystems, advancing toward the ``carbon neutrality{''} goal. The carbon storage effects of ecological restoration efforts remain insufficiently understood as previous studies have focused on carbon storage dynamics in ecosystems, yet the specific impacts of targeted mangrove restoration are less explored. This study utilizes multi-temporal remote sensing data and actual restoration data from Dongzhai Harbor Hainan Island to identify the mangrove wetland coverage and quantify the spatiotemporal evolution of carbon storage under various restoration efforts using the InVEST model. Additionally, we employed the PLUS model to simulate and compare carbon storage potential under multiple development goals. The findings reveal the following: (a) Mangrove restoration significantly increased the area of land with high carbon sink capability, resulting in a regional carbon storage increase of 210,001.68 tons from 2015 to 2021, with 97\% of this increase attributable to ecological restoration. (b) Mangrove coverage is crucial for regional carbon storage, with an average of 443 tons of carbon stored per hectare. Decreases in carbon storage occurred mainly during the conversion of mangroves to aquaculture, and forests/agriculture to residential areas. Increases in carbon storage were seen in the reverse transitions. (c) Comparing the scenarios focused solely on mangrove protection with cultivated land protection, the carbon storage in Dongzhai Harbor is projected to reach its maximum by 2045 under the carbon storage priority scenario. Our findings build a scientific foundation for formulating effective mangrove conservation and restoration strategies.

TI  - Carbon Dioxide Capture, Separation and Storage Technologies
AB  - As the world's energy demand increased with the increase in the population, the use of conventional energy sources increased leading to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Over the decade the CO2 ratio has increased in the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities, to lower the atmospheric CO2. International Energy Agency (IEA), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF), have jointly reported that we need to decrease CO2 emissions. According to the International Energy Agency, carbon capture technology can minimize global CO2 emissions by 17\% by 2050. CO2 capture technology is most feasible technology to reduce atmospheric CO2. The three main CO2 collection methods used for CCS are oxy-fuel combustion, pre-combustion, and post-combustion. Industries typically use post-combustion carbon capture to absorb CO2. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in oil and gas reservoirs, storage in impermeable coal beds, storage in saline aquifers, and deep ocean storage are the four main storage methods used in CO2 capture. It was determined that using CO2 storage with enhanced oil recovery applications concurrently increases oil production and stores CO2. There are several techniques used to separate CO2, but some important ones include adsorption, absorption, chemical separations, membrane separations, hydrate-based separation, and cryogenic distillation. Future research should take into account the need for scientific study on selective membrane applications in CO2 separation, Natural Gas Hydrates as a CO2 storage facility, and bio-additives for the creation of CO2 hydrates.

However, there has been a lack of visualized analysis regarding research content and trend development in the field of blue carbon sinks. This study utilized CiteSpace to visually analyze papers from the Web of Science Core Collection, covering the years 1995-2023. The analysis involved constructing co-occurrence maps and cluster maps of papers, keywords, and co-citation papers related to mangrove carbon sinks. The results revealed that keywords such as ``Mangrove,{''} ``Carbon Sequestration,{''} and ``Blue Carbon{''} had a high frequency of occurrence. Additionally, research topics like ``Blue Carbon,{'' ``Carbon Dioxide,{''} ``Stable Isotope,{''} ``Organic Matter,{''} and ``Coastal Wetlands{''} were found to be highly active. Key focus areas for future research include mangrove protection, enhancing resilience to climate change, carbon storage, and the development of carbon flux estimation models.

TI  - Uncovering the world's largest carbon sink-a profile of ocean carbon sinks research
AB  - As the world's largest carbon sink, the oceans are essential to achieving the 1.5 degrees C target. Marine ecosystems play a crucial role in the ``sink enhancement{''} process. A deeper comprehension of research trends, hotspots, and the boundaries of ocean carbon sinks is necessary for a more effective response to climate change. To this end, academic literature in the field of ocean carbon sinks was investigated and analyzed using the core database of the Web of Science. The results show that (1) The ocean carbon sink is a global study. The number of literatures in the field of ocean carbon sinks is growing, and the USA and China are the main leaders, with the USA accounting for 31.19\% of the global publications and China accounting for 26.57\% of the global publications, and the environmental science discipline is the most popular in this field. (2) Keyword burst detection shows that the keywords ``sink, sensitivity, land, dynamics, and seagrass{''} appear earliest and have high burst intensity, which are the hot spots of research in this field; the keyword clustering shows that the global ocean carbon sinks research mainly focuses on three themes: (i) carbon cycle and climate change; (ii) carbon sinks estimation models and techniques; and (iii) carbon sinks capacity and ocean biological carbon sequestration in different seas. Finally, targeted research recommendations are proposed to further match the ocean carbon sink research.

TI  - Sequestration of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in coastal ecosystems: Quantification, analysis, and planning
AB  - Many countries have come to a consensus that they need to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and promote low-carbon development. Mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and coral reefs are important coastal ecosystems that can effectively sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. In this study, the Carbon Emission Pinch Analysis (CEPA) approach was applied to develop a method of comparing strategies for maximising CO2 sequestration while minimising the economic cost. The proposed method replaces the emission factors and carbon emissions in CEPA with the economic cost and carbon sequestration amount to better suit the objectives of this study. The proposed method was applied to a case study on the coastal areas of Hainan Island in China. Four scenarios were considered concerning to the planting area, carbon sink, and economic cost. Scenarios 1 (increase the carbon sink by 10 \%), Scenario 2 (increase the carbon sink by 10 \% while limiting the planting area to 30 km(2)), and Scenario 3 (increase the carbon sink by 11 \%) were all considered feasible at an economic cost of <10 million EUR. However, Scenario 4 (increase the carbon sink by 12 \%) exceeded the specified limit (10 million EUR in adjustment costs) by 2.55 million EUR. The study shows that Scenario 3 is optimal because it achieves the target of increasing carbon sinks by 11 \% (increasing the annual carbon sequestration by 78.7423 million kg) within the constraints of planting area and economic costs. The study also shows that coral reefs are ideal for carbon sequestration.

TI  - Towards just, responsible, and socially viable carbon removal: lessons from offshore DACCS research for early-stage carbon removal projects
AB  - Increasingly, the removal and durable storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide is understood as necessary to meeting targets to limit climate change. While research on technologies for `carbon removal' or `negative emissions' is growing, little of that work has attended to the social implications of these technologies, such as how carbon removal initiatives might be formulated in ways that align with public values and principles of justice and just transitions. In this paper, we draw upon involvement in early-stage research on offshore direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) to reflect upon these questions. We argue that (1) carbon removal's links and associations with extractive industries must be anticipated and that issues of distrust and operational oversight be addressed; (2) employment of `climate solutions' and `climate urgency' narratives require care and reflexivity so as not to overwhelm other considerations; (3) despite the apparent absence of people, offshore contexts must be understood and treated as social contexts with impacts to people and communities; (4) both onshore and offshore contexts require recognition of Indigenous jurisdiction, rights and title in project planning and design; (5) discussions of a just transition for carbon removal must go beyond attention to employment to address questions of infrastructure ownership, monitoring and governance. Drawing on these reflections, we offer a set of recommendations for early-stage carbon removal projects. Together, these suggestions offer a starting place for making carbon removal research and deployment more just and aligned with broader societal priorities.

TI  - Gas hydrate technological applications: From energy recovery to carbon capture and storage
AB  - Hydrates are crystalline structures that trap small gas molecules inside hydrogen-bonded water cages. These structures form at high pressure and low temperature. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in gas hydrates for technological applications, specifically in energy recovery, as well as carbon dioxide capture and storage. In the CO2/CH4 exchange using gas hydrates, researchers have reported a large amount of natural gas trapped in the form of gas hydrates under the ocean seafloor and permafrost regions. This large amount of natural gas trapped inside hydrate cages in oceanic and permafrost deposits has driven interest in the energy sector to investigate the possibility of safely harvesting gas hydrates as one of energy resources. However, there are still unanswered fundamental questions including the mechanism of natural gas recovery from gas hydrates. Another gas hydrate-based technology that has a growing interest is the use of gas hydrates for separation including carbon dioxide capture and storage. Carbon dioxide molecules have been shown to be preferentially trapped in the hydrate phase, demonstrating the possibility of the usage for carbon capture technology. Similarly, there are still underlying concerns of these applications, such as thermodynamics and stability of gas hydrates in porous materials, and the crystallization kinetics and mechanism of hydrate formation. This paper provides an overview of laboratory investigations conducted to understand the mechanism and evaluate the feasibility of energy recovery as well as discussion on recent advances in laboratory investigations on gas hydrate-based technology.

TI  - Air-sea carbon dioxide equilibrium: Will it be possible to use seaweeds for carbon removal offsets?
AB  - To limit global warming below 2 degrees C by 2100, we must drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and additionally remove similar to 100-900 Gt CO2 from the atmosphere (carbon dioxide removal, CDR) to compensate for unavoidable emissions. Seaweeds (marine macroalgae) naturally grow in coastal regions worldwide where they are crucial for primary production and carbon cycling. They are being considered as a biological method for CDR and for use in carbon trading schemes as offsets. To use seaweeds in carbon trading schemes requires verification that seaweed photosynthesis that fixes CO2 into organic carbon results in CDR, along with the safe and secure storage of the carbon removed from the atmosphere for more than 100 years (sequestration). There is much ongoing research into the magnitude of seaweed carbon storage pools (e.g., as living biomass and as particulate and dissolved organic carbon in sediments and the deep ocean), but these pools do not equate to CDR unless the amount of CO2 removed from the atmosphere as a result of seaweed primary production can be quantified and verified. The draw-down of atmospheric CO2 into seawater is via air-sea CO2 equilibrium, which operates on time scales of weeks to years depending upon the ecosystem considered. Here, we explain why quantifying air-sea CO2 equilibrium and linking this process to seaweed carbon storage pools is the critical step needed to verify CDR by discrete seaweed beds and nearshore and open ocean aquaculture systems prior to their use in carbon trading.

TI  - A three-class carbon pool system for normalizing carbon mapping and accounting in coastal areas
AB  - Climate change is a key issue receiving increasing global attention. Coastal areas play an important role in mitigating climate change because of enormous potentials for carbon sequestration. Simulating and evaluating the carbon storage, increment, and value of coastal areas is of considerable importance in achieving carbon neutrality. In this study, the South Coast of Hangzhou Bay in China was selected as the study area. A three-class carbon pool system was established based on vegetation and soil and considering the coastline as the boundary for comprehensively revealing the carbon sink in coastal areas and accurately distinguishing the roles of different carbon pools. Then, the maps of carbon storage and increment were generated by integrating the field and remote sensing data through ``from point to area{''} spatial simulations. An accounting list was developed for systematically summarizing, precisely quantifying, and visually displaying the carbon storage, increment, and value following the three-class carbon pools. Results indicated that the carbon sink showed a gradient change from sea to land. Salt marshes had low storage but high increment, whereas areas above the coastline had the opposite characteristics. The total carbon storage of vegetation and soil were 1417.94 Gg and 3359.07 Gg, respectively, and their carbon increments during 2011-2022 were 309.17 Gg/yr and 29.46 Gg/yr, respectively. The carbon storage per area of vegetation and soil were 27.66 Mg/ha and 53.09 Mg/ha, respectively, and their carbon increments during 2011-2022 were 6.03 Mg/(ha yr) and 0.47 Mg/(ha yr), respectively. As the main body of blue carbon, salt marshes have achieved distinctly higher increment than the adjacent areas above the coastline. The carbon increment per area of soil was lower than 1/5 of vegetation in salt marshes. Mudflats had low carbon increment but large storage because of the extensive area. Alien species had higher increment in terms of vegetation but similar one from the perspective of soil compared with native species, denoting the low decrease of soil carbon sink when eliminating alien species. Considering the hazard of alien species to the health of coastal wetlands, this indicates the feasibility and necessity to develop the high-quality carbon sink in the study area. The carbon sink value based on the carbon stored in the soil summed to 1.68 million yuan, and were increased by 33\%, 7\%, 48\%, and 45\% in scenarios of baseline scenario, economic development, ecological protection, and comprehensive optimization, respectively. The present study validated the high carbon increment and immense increase potential and provided an applicable system to normalize carbon mapping and accounting in coastal areas.

TI  - Main current legal and regulatory frameworks for carbon dioxide capture, transport, and storage in the European Economic Area
AB  - There is broad consensus on the key role that carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, transport, and storage (CCTS) systems will play in mitigating climate change, either by removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it permanently or by avoiding CO2 emissions generated by point sources, especially from hard-to-abate sectors (e.g., waste-to-energy, cement, shipping or aviation). Although CCTS is ready to be implemented from a technical standpoint, the legal and regulatory framework required for its implementation and regulation could be further improved. In this article, we summarize and critically discuss the provisions of the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (the `OSPAR Convention'), and of the London protocol, as well as of the European CCS and ETS Directives. With a focus on the European Economic Area, we highlight existing gaps and hurdles that should be tackled in view of the large-scale deployment of CCTS. Furthermore, as the legal landscape for CO2 transport and geological storage is evolving rapidly, we provide an overview of recent clarifications on aspects of the existing legislation and a summary of new proposals presented by the European Commission in this space.

TI  - Seagrass decline weakens sediment organic carbon stability
AB  - Seagrass meadows are globally recognized as critical natural carbon sinks, commonly known as `blue carbon'. However, seagrass decline attributed to escalating human activities and climate change, significantly influences their carbon sequestration capacity. A key aspect in comprehending the impact of seagrass decline on carbon sequestration is understanding how degradation affects the stored blue carbon, primarily consisting of sediment organic carbon (SOC). While it is widely acknowledged that seagrass decline affects the input of organic carbon, little is known about its impact on SOC pool stability. To address this knowledge, we examined variations in total SOC and recalcitrant SOC (RSOC) at a depth of 15 cm in nine seagrass meadows located on the coast of Southern China. Our findings revealed that the ratio of RSOC to SOC (RSOC/SOC) ranged from 27 \% to 91 \% in the seagrass meadows, and the RSOC/SOC increased slightly with depth. Comparing different seagrass species, we observed that SOC and RSOC stocks were 1.94 and 3.19-fold higher under Halophila beccarii and Halophila ovalis meadows compared to Thalassia hemprichii and Enhalus acoroides meadows. Redundancy and correlation analyses indicated that SOC and RSOC content and stock, as well as the RSOC/SOC ratio, decreased with declining seagrass shoot density, biomass, and coverage. This implies that the loss of seagrass, caused by human activities and climate change, results in a reduction in carbon sequestration stability. Further, the RSOC decreased by 15 \%, 29 \%, and 40 \% under unvegetated areas compared to adjacent Halophila spp., T. hemprichii and E. acoroides meadows, respectively. Given the anticipated acceleration of seagrass decline due to climate change and increasing coastal development, our study provides timely information for developing coastal carbon protection strategies. These strategies should focus on preserving seagrass and restoring damaged seagrass meadows, to maximize their carbon sequestration capacity.

TI  - Integrated containment risks assessment for subsurface CO2 storage: Overburden analysis and top seal integrity study, offshore Norway
AB  - This study summarizes the OASIS (Overburden Analysis and Seal Integrity Study for CO2 Sequestration in the North Sea) project that focuses on assessing the containment risks associated with the geological carbon sequestration (CCS) of the Northern Lights project. CCS is viewed as one of the most effective solutions for reducing carbon emissions, as it captures carbon dioxide from point sources and permanently stores it in suitable geological formations. However, injecting CO2 into the subsurface may have mechanical consequences, including fault reactivation, top seal fracturing, surface heave, etc. This study proposes an interdisciplinary workflow to characterize the caprock, faults, and overburden associated with CCS projects in the Horda Platform area, to improve injection-induced containment risk assessment. Our findings show that the proposed workflows and tools effectively characterize stress-related mechanical hazards. However, due to the complex nature of rocks, it is challenging to evaluate the top seal integrity using a single method. Therefore, the proposed interdisciplinary approach is more effective for any fluid injection site's characterization, given the complex nature of the subsurface and its behavior under injection-induced stress changes. This research paper adds knowledge about the top seal integrity assessment and the reliability of injected CO2, making CCS projects more reliable and safer. Although this study focuses on the northern North Sea, the proposed methods are equally applicable globally to characterize subsurface CO2 storage sites. Apart from CCS projects, these research results can benefit other subsurface injection projects, such as water injection for reservoir management, wastewater injection for disposal, hydrogen storage, and hydraulic fracturing for unconventional hydrocarbon resources.

TI  - A bibliometric analysis of blue carbon (1993-2023): evolution of research hot topics and trends
AB  - Blue carbon refers to the carbon fixed in marine ecosystems such as mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds. Considered a treasure house for capturing and storing carbon dioxide, it can alleviate environmental issues linked to climate change and positively influence the environments where people live. Thus, to clarify the hotspots and development trends of blue carbon research, bibliometric analysis incorporating ScientoPy and VOSviewer software were used to quantitatively analyze 4,604 blue carbon publications from Web of Science and Scopus databases between 1993 and 2023. The results indicate a rapidly growing number of published studies on blue carbon, with blue carbon research being multifaceted and gradually becoming an interdisciplinary and international topic. This study on blue carbon, which is based on keyword clustering analysis, comprises three stages. The analysis of the strength of the cooperative connections between scholars in various countries who have published work on blue carbon. found that the cooperation networks of developed countries are strong and those of developing countries are relatively weak. Quantitative trend analysis reveals a growing focus on the restoration and conservation of blue carbon ecosystems, with remote sensing being the predominant technology used in the blue carbon research field in recent years. In blue carbon research, increasing carbon sequestration capacity, climate change mitigation, and carbon sequestration in macroalgae remain potential hotspots for research and development.

TI  - Blurring societal acceptance by lack of knowledge-insights from a German coastal population study on blue carbon
AB  - Within the context of climate change, coastal vegetated ecosystems have the capacity for long-term carbon storage. Blue carbon refers to such carbon trapped in the oceans and coastal shelf seas. These ecosystems are under anthropogenic pressure and, to help these ecosystems to thrive and realize their carbon storage potentials, interventions require acceptance from society, in general, and adjacent coastal communities, in particular. Through a random street survey along the German coasts in 2022, quantitative and qualitative data were collected from more than 200 participants. A questionnaire comprising 50 open and closed questions was designed to assess the status quo of German coastal residents' norms and values concerning blue carbon ecosystems. Focus was put on nature conservation and climate change perceptions. The survey results reveal that most residents along the German coast valued nature conservation while idealizing nature that is seen as ``untouched{''} by humans. Responses regarding active interventions to improve coastal ecosystem services were diverse. Blue carbon strategies are likely to operate within this area of tension. Most respondents were aware of climate change as a threat to their home region and were in favor of an increase in action against climate change there. The respondents were familiar with CO2 reduction and avoidance strategies. However, they were less aware of measures to remove atmospheric CO2 and the potential of storing CO2 in ecosystems beyond afforestation measures. Due to a lack of knowledge, no consolidated public opinions on blue carbon in coastal vegetated ecosystems could be identified, blurring societal acceptance of blue carbon strategies. While these ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to human disturbance, long-term carbon storage is essential for blue carbon. Therefore, the individual acceptance of interventions from people living in close proximity to intervention sites is key for sustained success. The present article concludes that there are possibilities to co-create knowledge and acceptance as prerequisites for blue carbon interventions to possibly become efficacious.

TI  - Efficient onboard carbon capture system using methanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cells
AB  - Green methanol is considered an important future hydrogen carrier in the maritime sector, however, its wide scale use is expected to be limited by the scarcity of biogenic carbon. This paper proposes a concept where onboard carbon capture (OCC) is used to facilitate acyclic use of biogenic carbon by storing the captured CO2 which can be re-used to produce new green methanol. To enable this concept a novel methanol-fueled solid oxide fuel cell system with cryogenic CO2 capture partly using absorption cooling is proposed. Three configurations of this system are developed. Based on steady-state thermodynamic models, it was found that the best system configuration was able to reach a steam-to-carbon ratio of 2, a system fuel utilization of 100\%, zero emissions, and a lower heating value electrical system efficiency of 63.9\%. This is on a par with the best power generation and OCC systems currently proposed in the literature.

TI  - Contribution of marine macrophytes to pCO2 and DOC variations in human-impacted coastal waters
AB  - Carbon cycles in coastal waters are highly sensitive to human activities and play important roles in global carbon budgets. CO2 sink-source behavior is regulated by spatiotemporal variations in net biological productivity, but the contribution of macrophyte habitats including macroalgae aquaculture to atmospheric CO2 removal has not been well quantified. We investigated the variations in the carbonate system and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in human-impacted macrophyte habitats and analyzed the biogeochemical drivers for the variations of these processes. Cultivated macroalgal metabolism (photosynthesis, respiration, calcification, and DOC release) was quantified by in situ field-bag experiments. Cultivated macroalgae took up dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (16.2-439 mmol-C m(-2) day(-1)) and released DOC (1.2-146 mmol-C m(-2) day(-1)). We estimated that seagrass beds and macroalgae farming contributed 0.8 and 0.4 mmol-C m(-2) day(-1) of the in situ total CO2 removal (5.7 and 6.7 mmol-C m(-2) day(-1), respectively) during their growing period in a semi-enclosed embayment but efficient water exchange (i.e., short residence time) in an open coastal area precluded detection of the contribution of macrophyte habitats to the CO2 removal. Although hydrological processes, biological metabolism, and organic carbon storage processes would contribute to the net CO2 sink-source behavior, our analyses distinguished the contribution of macrophytes from other factors. Our findings imply that macroalgae farming, in addition to restoring and creating macrophyte habitats, has potential for atmospheric CO2 removal.

TI  - Offshore carbon storage from power plants based on real option and multi -period source -sink matching: A case study in the eastern coastal China
AB  - Carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) emerges as a pivotal strategy for CO2 2 reduction in the power sector, particularly focusing on the overlooked domain of offshore storage along China's east coast. In spite of the potential high costs, irreversible investments, and lengthy development, offshore storage can still be prospective. Considering autonomous decision-making among emission sources, this study pioneers a CO2 2 offshore storage investment decision model tailored for coal-fired and gas-fired power plants. Innovating an offshore storage source-sink matching model with a real options model and introducing a pipeline network optimization model allows a realistic source-sink matching strategy to be explored under optimal investment timing. According to the results, among 154 large stationary emission sources in Zhejiang Province, offshore storage could reduce CO2 2 emissions by 4.59 Gt, utilizing the Qiantang, Minjiang, and Fuzhou depressions. It is economically feasible to implement offshore storage with a whole-process unit cost of 368.8 CNY/tCO2, CO2 , mainly dominated by capture costs. A hybrid carbon tax-subsidy policy promotes carbon reduction and economic benefits, offering a more effective incentive for emission sources to invest in offshore storage than a single policy. At a hybrid policy price of 250 CNY/tCO2, CO2 , all 27 selected emission sources are projected to invest in offshore storage by 2048, with a preference for the Qiantang depression as the storage site. Practically, this study provides important technical support and guidance for the large-scale deployment of offshore storage.

TI  - Large Porewater-Derived Carbon Outwelling Across Mangrove Seascapes Revealed by Radium Isotopes
AB  - Mangrove-dominated coastlines have high carbon sequestration capacity, but it remains unclear whether tidally outwelled carbon is transformed within the coastal ocean or exported offshore. Here, we used radium isotopes (Ra-224 and Ra-223) to investigate carbon outwelling in two mangrove seascapes in Brazil across multiple spatial scales. We sampled porewaters to define the source composition, mangrove creek waters to resolve tidal cycles, and cross-shelf transects to trace outwelling in coastal seascapes. Radium isotopes were positively correlated with dissolved inorganic (DIC), organic (DOC) and particulate organic (POC) carbon across the seascapes. DIC was the primary form of carbon (mean +/- SD), representing 85\% of the total carbon pool as bicarbonate (75 +/- 11\%), carbonate (6 +/- 5\%), and CO2 (4 +/- 9\%). DOC and POC accounted for 10 +/- 6\% and 5 +/- 6\% of total carbon, respectively. Although mangrove waters emitted CO2 to the atmosphere (38-143 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), both bays and continental shelves were a CO2 sink (-2.5 to -0.5 mmol m-2 d-1) associated to chlorophyll-a enrichments (r(2) = 0.86). Total carbon outwelled from mangroves were 3-4 times higher than soil carbon burial at both mangrove sites. Bicarbonate export (27-72 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) to the continental shelf was the major fate of carbon outwelling, more than doubling the perceived capacity of mangrove soil to sequester carbon. Hence, disregarding outwelling as a blue carbon sink mechanism would lead to underestimated assessments of how mangroves capture CO2 and help to mitigate climate change.

TI  - CO2 capture, geological storage, and mineralization using biobased biodegradable chelating agents and seawater
AB  - Geological storage and mineralization of CO2 in mafic/ultramafic reservoirs faces challenges including limited effective porosity, permeability, and rock reactivity; difficulties in using seawater for CO2 capture; and uncontrolled carbonation. This study introduces a CO2 capture, storage, and mineralization approach with the utilization of biobased biodegradable chelating agents and seawater. An acidic chelating agent solution is used to increase effective porosity and permeability through enhanced mineral dissolution. For instance, applying an acidic N,N-Bis(carboxymethyl)-L-glutamate solution to a porous basalt increased effective porosity by 16\% and permeability by 26-fold in 120 hours. Subsequently, alkaline chelating agent-containing seawater improves CO2 capture and storage by inhibiting mineralization, thus maintaining injectivity while providing ions for mineralization and further expanding storage space. Last, controlled mineralization is achieved by adjusting chelating agent biodegradation. Promising CO2 storage and mineralization capacities two orders higher than current techniques, this approach reduces required reservoir volume while enhancing efficiency.

TI  - Next steps for assessing ocean iron fertilization for marine carbon dioxide removal
AB  - There are many potential approaches to marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR), of which ocean iron fertilization (OIF) has the longest history of study. However, OIF studies to date were not primarily designed to quantify the durability of carbon (C) storage, nor how wise OIF might be as an mCDR approach. To quantify C sequestration, we introduce a metric called the ``centennial tonne,{''} defined as 1,000 kg of C isolated from atmospheric contact for on average at least 100 years. We present the activities needed to assess OIF from a scientific and technological perspective, and additionally, how it might be responsibly studied and potentially deployed. The five activities include: field studies in the Northeast Pacific; improved modeling for field studies, data assimilation and predictions at larger scales; improvements in monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) for C, and also MRV for tracking ecological and environmental impacts; and developing new iron sources and their delivery, to increase efficiencies and reduce costs. The fifth activity is to understand whether public and community support exists for OIF, and what governance structures might support further research and possible deployment of OIF. This article is written by a multidisciplinary experts group called Exploring Ocean Iron Solutions (ExOIS) that is organized around a responsible code of conduct. Of the mCDR approaches, OIF has the potential to be low cost, scalable, and rapidly deployable. Reducing CO2 emissions must lead the way, but there is also an urgency to decide under what conditions and whether OIF might be deployed or not.

TI  - Modeling a supply chain for carbon capture and offshore storage-A German-Norwegian case study
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) for industrial emission point sources is one of the potential instruments to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) goals. However, emission point sources and storage formations are often far from each other, which requires capable CO2 transportation infrastructure. While pipeline transportation promises low cost for high and stable flows of CO2, ship transportation may be more expensive but also more flexible with regards to transport quantities and storage locations. Here, we present a mixed integer programming (MIP) model to provide decision support for a CCS Supply Chain Design Problem (CCS-SCDP) with the goal of minimizing total supply chain costs. We apply the model to four future CO2 supply scenarios, capturing CO2 from German industrial sources and bringing them to the Northern Lights unloading port in Kollsnes, Norway, for storage in a submarine geological formation. Our analysis reveals that the fraction of transportation costs of total supply chain costs drop considerably from 22 to 10 percent by economies of scale if annual capture volume increases. For low capture volumes, a ship-based solution is cheaper, while an offshore pipeline solution is favored for larger capture volumes. Accordingly, the potential gains from economies of scale in a pipeline-based solution must be balanced against potential lock-in effects in the investment decision for a CCS supply chain.

TI  - Analysing direct air capture for enabling negative emissions in Germany: an assessment of the resource requirements and costs of a potential rollout in 2045
AB  - Direct air capture (DAC) combined with subsequent storage (DACCS) is discussed as one promising carbon dioxide removal option. The aim of this paper is to analyse and comparatively classify the resource consumption (land use, renewable energy and water) and costs of possible DAC implementation pathways for Germany. The paths are based on a selected, existing climate neutrality scenario that requires the removal of 20 Mt of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year by DACCS from 2045. The analysis focuses on the so-called ``low-temperature{''} DAC process, which might be more advantageous for Germany than the ``high-temperature{''} one. In four case studies, we examine potential sites in northern, central and southern Germany, thereby using the most suitable renewable energies for electricity and heat generation. We show that the deployment of DAC results in large-scale land use and high energy needs. The land use in the range of 167-353 km2 results mainly from the area required for renewable energy generation. The total electrical energy demand of 14.4 TWh per year, of which 46\% is needed to operate heat pumps to supply the heat demand of the DAC process, corresponds to around 1.4\% of Germany's envisaged electricity demand in 2045. 20 Mt of water are provided yearly, corresponding to 40\% of the city of Cologne's water demand (1.1 million inhabitants). The capture of CO2 (DAC) incurs levelised costs of 125-138 EUR per tonne of CO2, whereby the provision of the required energy via photovoltaics in southern Germany represents the lowest value of the four case studies. This does not include the costs associated with balancing its volatility. Taking into account transporting the CO2 via pipeline to the port of Wilhelmshaven, followed by transporting and sequestering the CO2 in geological storage sites in the Norwegian North Sea (DACCS), the levelised costs increase to 161-176 EUR/tCO2. Due to the longer transport distances from southern and central Germany, a northern German site using wind turbines would be the most favourable.

TI  - The carbon stock potential of the restored mangrove ecosystem of Pasarbanggi, Rembang, Central Java
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems can absorb significant amounts of carbon and help mitigate climate change. However, their existence continues to be endangered by natural and human forces. Therefore, mangrove restoration is regarded as a crucial component of the global climate change agenda. This study aims to estimate the potential total carbon stock of restored mangrove ecosystems in Pasarbanggi, Rembang, Central Java. The above-below ground (root) carbon stock was calculated using several published allometric equations. The loss-on-ignition method analyzed leaf litter and sediment carbon stocks. This study estimates the Pasarbanggi mangrove ecosystem's total carbon stock potential at 0.02 x 106 MgC, which is equivalent to the potential CO2 emission of 0.08 x 106 MgCO2e, with up to 65\% stored in sediments. This study highlights the critical role of restored mangrove ecosystems on the climate change mitigation agenda by reducing the concentration of atmospheric CO2.

TI  - Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement in Deep Water Formation Regions Under Low and High Emission Pathways
AB  - Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) is an ocean-based Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) method to mitigate climate change. Studies to characterize regional differences in OAE efficiencies and biogeochemical effects are still sparse. As subduction regions play a pivotal role for anthropogenic carbon uptake and centennial storage, we here evaluate OAE efficiencies in the subduction regions of the Southern Ocean, the Northwest Atlantic, and the Norwegian-Barents Sea region. Using the ocean biogeochemistry model FESOM2.1-REcoM3, we simulate continuous OAE globally and in the subduction regions under high (SSP3-7.0) and low (SSP1-2.6) emission scenarios. The OAE efficiency calculated by two different metrics is higher (by 8\%-30\%) for SSP3-7.0 than for SSP1-2.6 due to a lower buffer factor in a high-CO2 \$\{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{C\}\textbackslash{}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{2\ world. All subduction regions show a CDR potential (0.23-0.31; PgC CO2 \$\{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{C\}\textbackslash{}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{2\ uptake per Pg alkaline material) consistent with global OAE for both emission scenarios. Calculating the efficiency as the ratio of excess dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to excess alkalinity shows that the Southern Ocean and the Northwest Atlantic are as efficient as the global ocean (0.79-0.85), while the Norwegian-Barents Sea region has a lower efficiency (0.65-0.75). The subduction regions store a fraction of excess carbon below 1 km that is 1.9 times higher than the global ocean. The excess surface alkalinity and thus CO2 \$\{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{C\}\textbackslash{}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{2\ uptake and storage follow the mixed-layer depth seasonality, with the majority of the excess CO2 \$\{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{C\}\textbackslash{}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{2\ flux occurring in summer at shallow mixed layer depths. This study therefore highlights that subduction regions can be efficient for OAE if optimal deployment strategies are developed. Increasing atmospheric CO2 \$\{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{C\}\textbackslash{}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{2\ concentrations demand urgent reductions in the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to limit the increase in global air temperatures to <= 2 degrees \$\{\textbackslash{}le\} 2\{\}<\^{}>\{\textbackslash{}circ\}\$C relative to preindustrial conditions. To compensate for/counteract the small fraction of unavoidable emissions, it will also be necessary to implement a portfolio of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods. In this study, we focus on the ocean-based CDR method Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE), which enhances oceanic carbon uptake and can thus aid in atmospheric CO2 \$\{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{C\}\textbackslash{}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{2\ reduction. Oceanic subduction regions are key for anthropogenic carbon uptake and its centennial storage. Therefore, we simulate OAE in the deep and bottom water formation regions of the Southern Ocean, Northwest Atlantic and the Norwegian-Barents Sea region to assess their carbon uptake and storage efficiency compared to the global ocean. We find that the subduction regions exhibit equivalent carbon uptake efficiency to the global ocean, and are nearly two times more effective in deep ocean carbon storage with respect to OAE. Seasonal mixed layer depth variability, however, influences the resulting surface alkalinity concentrations and thus CO2 \$\{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{C\}\textbackslash{}mathrm\{O\}\}\_\{2\ uptake and DIC accumulation. Therefore, our study emphasizes that the subduction regions can be efficient for OAE when appropriate deployment strategies are developed. Southern Ocean and Northwest Atlantic Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement efficiencies are akin to the global ocean and larger than in the Norwegian-Barents Sea region The subduction regions can store a fraction of excess carbon in the deep ocean that is nearly two times higher than in the global ocean Seasonal mixed layer depth variations govern excess surface alkalinity concentrations and thus the excess carbon uptake and storage

TI  - Reversibility of Greenland ice sheet mass loss under artificial carbon dioxide removal scenarios
AB  - With ongoing anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the Greenland ice sheet (GIS) approaches critical thresholds of inevitable, long-term mass loss. Future technologies might be able to efficiently remove CO2 from the atmosphere and thereby cool down our planet. We explore whether and to what extent a realization of this concept could lead to a regrowth of the GIS once it has partly melted. Using the fully coupled Earth system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER-X, emission pulses between 0 and 4000 GtC are released into the atmosphere, and after 1 kyr, 2 kyr, and 5 kyr, the atmospheric CO2 concentration is reduced back to its pre-industrial value. We find that independent of a specific trajectory, once the southern part of the GIS has partly melted with a total mass loss of more than 0.4 m sea level equivalent, regrowth is inhibited. Uncertainties preclude determination of precise thresholds, but model results indicate that cumulative industrial-era emissions approaching 1000-1500 GtC and beyond increasingly risk irreversible mass loss of the GIS. Once this threshold is passed, artificial atmospheric carbon removal would need to be utilised within the next centuries at massive scale. Beyond that, artificial atmospheric carbon removal has limited abilities to avoid long-term mass loss of the GIS. In conclusion, keeping cumulative anthropogenic emissions below 1000-1500 GtC is the only safe way to avoid irreversible mass loss of the GIS.

TI  - Environmental Life Cycle Assessment of Innovative Ejectors Plant Technology for Sediment By-Pass in Harbours and Ports
AB  - Sedimentation is the natural process of sediment transportation and deposition in quiescent water conditions. Sedimentation can affect the functionality of ports, harbours and navigation channels by reducing water depth, making navigation difficult, if not impossible. Different solutions are available to guarantee infrastructure functionality against sedimentation, with maintenance dredging being the most widely adopted. Alternative technologies for dredging have been developed and tested to reduce the environmental concerns related to dredging operations. Among other solutions, applying a sediment by-pass system based on a jet pump emerged as one of the most promising. While the existing literature covers the techno-economic aspects of sediment by-pass systems, the environmental impacts must be better evaluated and assessed. This paper aims to resolve this gap by evaluating, through the ReCiPe2016 life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, the environmental impact of an innovative sediment by-pass system called an ``ejectors plant{''}. The LCA results are based on the demonstrator established in Cervia Harbour in Italy, which was extensively monitored for 15 months during its operation. This paper shows how energy consumption during the operation phase highly affects the considered midpoint and endpoint categories. For example, the GWP100 of the ejectors plant, considering the Italian electricity mix, equals 1.75 million tons of equivalent CO2 over 20 years, while under a low-carbon scenario, it is reduced to 0.17. In that case, material consumption in the construction phase becomes dominant, thus highlighting the importance of eco-innovation of ejectors plants to minimise oxidant formation. Finally, this paper compares the ejectors plant and traditional dredging through environmental LCA. The ejectors plant had a lower impact in all categories except for GWP-related categories. The sensitivity analysis showed how such a conclusion may be mitigated by considering different electricity mixes and maintenance dredging working cycles.

TI  - Modelling the spatiotemporal dynamics of blue carbon stocks in tidal marsh under Spartina alterniflora invasion
AB  - Spatial quantification of blue carbon ecosystem stocks is crucial for developing policies to mitigate climate change, especially in regions experiencing ongoing wetland disturbance from biological invasions. We integrated multiple machine learning models with the space-for-time substitution method to quantify the spatiotemporal impact of Spartina alterniflora invasion on tidal marsh sediment blue carbon (soil organic carbon - `SOC') stocks at 100 cm depth in the Yangtze Estuary. Our results show that the invasive S. alterniflora contributed more than half of the total SOC stocks (2,056 +/- 379 Gg C, 1 Gg = 106 6 kg) in the 27,600 ha tidal marshes of the Yangtze Estuary, which were estimated to be 1,107 +/- 176 Gg C. S. alterniflora increased the SOC stocks in the Yangtze Estuary within the first 15 years, but this gain was not sustained in the long term, with a gradual decline (by 13.14 Mg C/ha) observed after 15 years of S. alterniflora growth. We found that sediment salinity, tidal range, and human accessibility were strong indicators for modeling and predicting SOC stocks, with Random Forest providing the best simulation of tidal marsh SOC stocks (R2 2 = 0.894, RMSE=7.646 =7.646 Mg C/ha, and MAPE=9.469 =9.469 \%). Our study provides much needed information on blue carbon stocks in the Yangtze Estuary under biological invasion stress, and offers guidance for targeted S. alterniflora management actions in the future.

TI  - Quantifying blue carbon stocks in interconnected seagrass, coral reef, and sandy coastline ecosystems in the Western Gulf of Thailand
AB  - Coastal and marine ecosystems play a major role in the global carbon cycle. Connected marine and coastal ecosystems are commonly observed in the Western Gulf of Thailand. Little is known about the blue carbon potential of these interconnected ecosystems and seascapes. This study aims to quantify blue carbon stocks in the interconnected seagrass-coral reef-sandy coastal ecosystems at Samui Island, the Western Gulf of Thailand. At each study site, the samples of seagrasses, algae, and sediments, were collected from the different zones along a transect of interconnected sandy beach-seagrass bed-coral reef habitats, and the organic carbon contents were quantified using elemental analysis and loss on ignition (LOI). Our findings indicate that the habitats may provide a potential blue carbon opportunity. With a total area of 178.04 hectares (ha), consisting of sand (47.70 ha), seagrass beds (122.44 ha), macroalgal beds (2.40 ha), and live corals (5.50 ha), the estimated carbon storage was as much as 9,222.75 MgC; 74.03\% of which was stored in sediment, while the rest was as biomass (25.97\%). About 96 percent of the total carbon storage was found in seagrass beds (122.44 ha) with a total amount of carbon storage of 8,876.99 MgC, consisting of 8,781.01 MgC and 95.98 MgC of shallow- and deep-seagrass beds, respectively. The carbon stocks in seagrass, algal biomass, and sediment ranged from 1.58 - 19.10 MgC.ha-1, 2.51 -10.45 MgC.ha-1, and 0.93 - 58.46 MgC.ha-1, respectively. Comparing the carbon storage at each study site, Ko Tan showed the highest value of carbon storage, accounting for 4,232.21 MgC, followed by Ao Phangka (2,901.83 MgC), Ao Thong Tanod (1,459.57 MgC) and Ko Mudsum (629.14 MgC). The quantities of carbon stocks varied considerably among microhabitats and the connectivity of these coastal and marine ecosystems may support the carbon stocks potential of the interconnected ecosystems. Ultimately, the findings from this study provide baseline data that supports Thailand's nationally determined contribution and highlight the importance of interconnected coastal ecosystems in carbon sequestration and storage that should not be overlooked.

TI  - Dynamic Response Analysis of Corroded Pipelines Containing SCCO2 under Rockfall Impact
AB  - Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies are crucial for reducing CO2 emissions. Currently, subsea CO2 storage is considered a highly feasible CCUS method. With the development of marine CCUS projects, impact loads from ship anchoring and marine debris, combined with internal corrosion defects in CO2 transport pipelines, significantly increase the risk of pipeline failure. This represents a major challenge for offshore SCCO2 pipelines. To investigate the stress-strain response of corroded pipelines under impact loads, a pipeline model with corrosion defects under rockfall impact conditions was established using ABAQUS 2014 finite element software. By varying factors such as the rock mass, impact velocity, drop point, and defect area, a single-variable analysis was conducted to explore the dynamic response of the pipeline. The results indicate that the rock mass and impact velocity are the key factors affecting pipeline stress, while the drop point and defect area have minimal impacts. Additionally, when the pipeline reaches yield failure, the effects of these factors become negligible.

TI  - Dynamic Estimation of Mangrove Carbon Storage in Hainan Island Based on the InVEST-PLUS Model
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are pivotal to the global carbon budget. However, there is still a dearth of research addressing the impact of regional mangrove land use and land cover change (LUCC) on carbon sequestration and its associated spatial distribution patterns. To investigate the impact of different development scenarios on the carbon storage capacity of mangrove ecosystems, we focused on Hainan Island. We used LUCC data from 2010 to 2020 from mangrove-inhabited regions. The Markov-PLUS model was applied to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of mangrove coverage under the natural increase scenario (NIS) and the mangrove protection scenario (MPS) over the next 40 years. Carbon storage was estimated using the InVEST model based on field-measured carbon density data. The outcomes show the following: (1) The Markov-PLUS model, with an overall accuracy of 0.88 and a Kappa coefficient of 0.82, is suitable for predicting mangrove distribution patterns on Hainan Island. (2) Environmental factors were the main drivers of historical mangrove changes on Hainan Island, explaining 54\% of the variance, with elevation, temperature, and precipitation each contributing over 13\%. (3) From 2025 to 2065, the mangrove area on Hainan Island is projected to increase by approximately 12,505.68 ha, mainly through conversions from forest land (12.73\% under NIS and 12.37\% under MPS) and agricultural land (39.72\% under NIS and 34.53\% under MPS). (4) The carbon storage increment within Hainan Island's mangroves is projected at 2.71 TgC over the whole island, with notable increases expected in the eastern, northern, and northwestern regions, and modest gains in other areas. In this study, we comprehensively investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics and future trends of carbon storage in the mangroves of Hainan Island, offering invaluable guidance for the long-term management of mangrove ecosystems and the realization of carbon neutrality goals by 2060.
