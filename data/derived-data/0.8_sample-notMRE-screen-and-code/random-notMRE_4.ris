TI  - An increasing CO2 sink in the Arctic Ocean due to sea-ice loss
AB  - The Arctic Ocean and adjacent continental shelf seas such as the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas are particularly sensitive to long-term change and low-frequency modes of atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice forcing. The cold, low salinity surface waters of the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean are undersaturated with respect to CO2 in the atmosphere and the region has the potential to take up atmospheric CO2, although presently suppressed by sea-ice cover. Undersaturated seawater CO2 conditions of the Arctic Ocean are maintained by export of water with low dissolved inorganic carbon content and modified by intense seasonal shelf primary production. Sea-ice extent and volume in the Arctic Ocean has decreased over the last few decades, and we estimate that the Arctic Ocean sink for CO2 has tripled over the last 3 decades (24 Tg yr-1 to 66 Tg yr-1) due to sea-ice retreat with future sea-ice melting enhancing air-to-sea CO2 flux by âˆ¼28% per decade.

TI  - New artificial intelligence technology improving fuel efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions of ships through use of operational big data
AB  - Fuel cost and CO2 emissions in operating ships are major challenges for the maritime industry. A large marine transport company spends more than 2.6 billion U.S. dollars on fuel every year. In order to reduce fuel consumption as well as CO2 emissions from ships, it is crucial to be able to accurately calculate the impact of winds and waves on ship speed and fuel efficiency. Normally, existing ship performance estimation technologies rely on experiments with model ships in tanks of water, or on physics model simulations. However, they do not take into account the complicated interactions of winds, waves, and sea currents that influence the state of ships at real sea waters, resulting in large margins of error. Against this background, Fujitsu Laboratories has developed a technology to visualize ship performance. In addition to weather and sea conditions including winds, waves, and sea currents during actual ship operation, it collects engine log data and ship operation data such as location and ship speed, and posts it to the cloud, and then analyzes these data using high-dimensional statistical analysis that we developed. Applying this technology to a university-owned test ship and some merchant ships resulted in highly accurate estimation of ship speed and fuel consumption for each of the ships, with error of 5% or less. We also evaluated this technology through simulation and verified that it can improve fuel efficiency significantly. This paper describes this technology to predict ship performance in real sea waters, which is key to reducing ship fuel consumption, with some examples of system configurations.

TI  - The powering of subsea facilities for remote offshore oil and gas fields
AB  - The development of offshore fields is supported by drilling and production equipment which requires high performance and a reliable power supply. Russian offshore fields that can be developed using subsea technologies are located at up to 650 km from onshore infrastructures under extreme ice conditions. Requirements for the equipment capacities of power supplies may vary from dozens of kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts. It has been recognized that these days one of the most reliable and safe techniques for powering subsea oil and gas facilities is power transmission from an onshore power supply source through a subsea cable. Different systems of high voltage power supply have been considered: direct high voltage current transmission, alternating current and low frequency alternating current transmission. They have been compared in terms of loss minimization during power transmission and conversion, and the provision of reliability and safety of unattended operating. It has been concluded that high voltage direct current transmission at long distances ensures the sufficient reduction of cable losses as compared to alternating current transmission, but subsea DC-AC conversion (as subsea equipment usually uses alternating current) requires the development of a subsea converter.

TI  - Co-benefits of large-scale renewables in remote Australia: energy futures and climate change
AB  - Desert/remote Australia is blessed with abundant natural energy resources from solar, geothermal and other renewable sources. If these were harnessed and connected appropriately desert/remote Australia could be not only energy self-sufficient but a net exporter. Generation of abundant, clean energy can also attract energy-intensive industries and provide local income and employment. Such co-benefits should be included in any cost-benefit analysis. Regardless of renewable energy's contribution to reducing climate change, the world is already committed to global warming and associated climate changes. Desert/remote Australia will thus inevitably get warmer, with implications for health, energy demand and other issues, and may be subject to increased extremes such as flooding, longer dry spells, more severe storms and coastal inundation. In addition, the prospect of world demand for oil from conventional sources exceeding supply will likely lead to oil shortages, higher oil prices, and additional incentives to provide alternative energy supplies. The region is heavily reliant on diesel generators and fossil fuel-powered motor vehicles and airplanes for transport for within-region mobility, the importation of goods, the tourism industry and emergency medical services. Without adaptation, climate change and peak oil will make living in desert/remote Australia less attractive, resulting in increased difficulty of attracting and retaining skilled workers, which would constrain development. This paper focuses on the climate and energy-related impacts and potential responses. These are both a challenge and an opportunity. They could provide additional employment and income, thus helping remote communities to participate in the clean energy economy of the future and thus overcome some serious social problems. The paper attempts to review current knowledge and provoke debate on relevant investment strategies, and it teases out the questions in need of further research.

TI  - Air-water CO2 and water-sediment O-2 exchanges over a tidal flat in Tokyo Bay
AB  - Despite the potential for carbon storage in tidal flats, little is known about the details of relevant processes because of the complexity of intertidal physical and chemical environments and the uniqueness of the biota. We measured air-water carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and water-sediment oxygen (O-2) fluxes over a tidal flat in Tokyo Bay by the eddy covariance method, which has the potential to facilitate long-term, broad-scale, continuous monitoring of carbon flows in tidal flats. The results indicated that throughout the tidal flat in Tokyo Bay, CO2 was taken up from the atmosphere at a rate of 6.05 +/- 7.14 (mean +/- SD) mmol m(-2) hour(-1), and O-2 was taken up from the water into the sediment at a rate of 0.62 +/- 1.14 (mean +/- SD) mmol m(-2) hour(-1). The fact that the CO2 uptake rate was about 18 times faster than the previously reported average uptake rate in the whole area of Tokyo Bay was attributable to physical turbulence in the water column caused by bottom friction. Statistical analysis suggested that light intensity and water temperature were the major factors responsible for variations of CO2 and O-2 exchange, respectively. Other factors such as freshwater inputs, atmospheric stability, and wind speed also affected CO2 and O-2 exchange. High rates of O-2 uptake from the water into the sediment surface and high rates of atmospheric CO2 uptake into the water column occurred simultaneously (R-2 = 0.44 and 0.47 during day and night, respectively). The explanation could be that photosynthetic consumption of CO2 and production of O-2 in the water column increased the downward CO2 (air to water) and O-2 (water to sediment) fluxes by increasing the concentration gradients of those gases. Resuspension of sediment in the low-O-2 layer by physical disturbance would also increase the O-2 concentration gradient and the O-2 flux in the water.

TI  - Energy, exergy and economy (3E) investigation of a SOFC-GT-ORC waste heat recovery system for green power ships
AB  - Ships are moving land in the vast ocean and are an indispensable means of transportation for humanity. At present, green power systems and low-carbon fuels are the development trend of energy-saving, emission-reduction, and low-carbon consumption of green ships. However, existing ships have many waste heat emissions and considerable noise pollution from shipboard electromechanical equipment. Based on the above issues, this study combined SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cells) with a GT (Gas Turbine) and ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle). It proposed a waste heat-driven composite energy recovery system for the green power ships. Based on the feasibility analysis of single SOFC performance and waste heat utilization, combined with GT-ORC system, the thermodynamic model construction, working medium selection, energy, exergy and economy (3E) analysis of the whole system are carried out. The result shows that among the effective energy destruction of the entire system, the endogenous effective energy loss accounts for 89.73\%. The avoidable-endogenous energy destruction of GT accounted for 92.95\%, which has a significant improvement in saving space. The investment cost of heat exchanger accounts for the highest proportion, which is 22.62\%. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on strengthening the heat exchange process to reduce the investment cost. The evaporative pressure and isentropic efficiency seriously affect the investment ratio of the system, in which the investment of expander and working medium pump increases by 34.6\% and 153.3\%, respectively, within the allowable working conditions.

TI  - The evolution of marine gas turbine controls
AB  - The background and evolution of gas turbine fuel controls is examined in this paper from a Naval perspective. The initial application of aeroderivative gas turbines to Navy ships utilized the engineâ€™s existing aircraft fuel controls, which were coupled to the shipâ€™s hydropneumatic machinery control system. These engines were adapted to Naval requirements by including engine specific functions. The evolution of Naval gas turbine controllers first to analog electronic, and more recently, to distributed digital controls, has increased the system complexity and added a number of levels of machinery protection. The design of a specific electronic control module is used to illustrate the current state of the technology. The paper concludes with a discussion of the further need to address the issues of fuel handling, metering and control in Navy ships with particular emphasis on integration in the marine environment.

TI  - Benthic-pelagic coupling and export of organic carbon from a tropical Atlantic continental shelf-Sierra Leone
AB  - An approximate carbon budget for the Sierra Leone River Estuary and adjacent inner continental shelf indicates that phytoplankton production is balanced by grazers only in the wet season estuary; on the continental shelf, and in the dry season estuary, phytoplankton production exceeds demand of consumer populations by 70-90%. Regional production is dominated by the dry season estuary where diatom blooms support large population of the phytophagous clupeid fish Ethmalosa fimbriata. It is suggested that as well as what is used in bacterial respiration, not quantified in the study, important amounts of inshore organic carbon production are available for export, or burial, or both, either in inshore mudbanks or at the shelf edge by slumping. This carbon budget for a tropical continental shelf having neither coral-reefs nor coastal upwelling appears to correspond with what is emerging as a generic distinction between shelves and open ocean ecosystems: surplus production on shelves, balance between producers and consumers in the open ocean.

TI  - Analysis of forty years long changes in coastal land use and land cover of the Yellow Sea: The gains or losses in ecosystem services
AB  - The drastic land cover change and its impacts in the Yellow Sea have long been significant issues in terms of coastal vulnerabilities, but holistic data analysis is limited. The present study first reports 40 years long geographical changes of the Yellow Sea coasts including all three neighboring countries of China, North Korea, and South Korea. We delineated tidal flats by analysis of Landsat series satellite imageries (662 scenes) between 1981 and 2016. A total area of the Yellow Sea tidal flats has been considerably reducing for the past 36 years, from âˆ¼10,500 km2 (1980s) to âˆ¼6700 km2 (2010s), say âˆ¼1% annual loss. A majority loss of tidal flats was mainly due to the grand reclamations that conducted in almost entire coast of the Yellow Sea, particularly concentrated in the 1990s-2000s. Coastal reclaimed area during the past four decades reached âˆ¼9700 km2, including ongoing and planned projects, which corresponds to over half the area of precedent natural tidal flats of the Yellow Sea. The potential carbon stocks in the eight representative regions with large scale reclamation indicated significant loss in carbon sink capacity in the South Korea's coast (âˆ¼99%), while evidenced a lesser loss from the China's coast (âˆ¼31%). It was noteworthy that the progradation of tidal flats after the reclamation in China's coast significantly reduced the loss of carbon sequestration. According to the ecosystem services valuation for the Yellow Sea, a total loss was estimated as âˆ¼8 billion USD yrâˆ’1 with relatively high proportional loss (up to 25%) of climate regulating services (viz., carbon sequestration). Overall, huge losses in ecosystem services being provided by the Yellow Sea natural tidal flats need immediate action to prevent or at least alleviate accelerating ecological deteriorations. Finally, future conservative policy direction on coastal wetlands management has been proposed towards enhancement of marine ecosystem services. â€œAbout half of natural tidal flats of the Yellow Sea disappeared primarily due to reclamation for the last 40 years, accordingly coastal carbon stocks were drastically reduced.â€ Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - An environmental management system in seaports: evidence from Malaysia
AB  - Seaports face significant environmental challenges in their role as hubs for logistics activities, particularly since ships are significant contributors to energy consumption, global warming and air and marine pollution. The environmental pressures facing ports has led to the emergence of the green port concept. Port Klang is the largest port in Malaysia, characterised not only by significant container throughput, but also by significant congestion issues, emissions and pollution. These characteristics led to the selection of Port Klang, the nation's major seaport, as a case study for this analysis of the variables most relevant in the effective implementation of the green port concept and subsequent research into how this green seaport concept influences a seaport's future competitiveness. To achieve these aims, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been employed. The findings of the analysis suggest that environmental quality, the use of energy and resources, waste handling and habitat quality and greenery are the critical influential factors required for establishing green port hub status and that then port competitiveness is most significantly affected by green operations, sustainable equipment, resources management and cost efficiency at seaports.

TI  - Changing Port Governance Model: Port Spatial Structure and Trade Efficiency
AB  - Cao, L., 2020. Changing port governance model: Port spatial structure and trade efficiency. In: MalvÃ¡rez, G. and Navas, F. (eds.), Global Coastal Issues of 2020. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue No. 95, pp. 963-968. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. The port governance mode is divided into port spatial structure and information construction. Through the optimization of port governance mode, improving trade efficiency and smooth information of port waterway, it is the basis of orderly promotion of waterway transportation, which is closely related to the development of port waterway hub, establishes a perfect port engineering information system, and realizes the construction of customer group of port spatial structure management project. To realize the integrated development of customer informatization and the informatization level of port spatial structure management project, the whole operation quality and efficiency of port spatial structure management project are directly related to the whole operation quality of port spatial structure governance project. Therefore, port units should increase the investment in information construction and promote the smooth realization of the goal of information construction. We will continue to deepen the work of energy conservation and emission reduction in the port industry. To complete the task of port energy saving and emission reduction and to ensure the realization of the goal of energy saving and emission reduction, the most fundamental thing is to establish a long-term mechanism for the development of low-carbon green ports, promote the benign interaction between ports and foreign trade, and actively expand the service depth of the hinterland economy. Further strengthen the cooperation between Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei port groups, realize the optimal allocation of cargo source structure, constantly increase port logistics infrastructure investment, especially container terminal investment, constantly optimize and enhance the port logistics industry, develop modern new port logistics, speed up the transformation and upgrading of port logistics, and promote the mutual promotion of port economy and foreign trade. The analysis shows that the adoption of optimized seaport governance model can promote trade growth. Â© Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc. 2020.

TI  - Optimization Electricity Supply for Thousand Island Jakarta Province by Using Hybrid Photovoltaic-Wind Turbine-Diesel Generator-Crude Palm Oil (CPO) Power Plant-Battery System
AB  - The Thousand Islands as part of the DKI Jakarta Province which has more than 110 islands with an electrification ratio of 100%. The electricity supply for the inhabitant islands in Thousand Islands region is supplied by State Electricity Company (PLN) with the on-grid interconnecting system on the medium voltage marine line I (SKLTM) along 76.79 km. Meanwhile Sebira Island supplies electricity using the Diesel Power Plant (PLTD) provided by the Regional Government (PEMDA). To increase the reliability of the SKLTM line I system in the Thousand Islands, SKLTM line II will be built along 67.7 km in 2018-2021. Based on the description of the development plan, this paper will redesign the electricity supply system with 100% renewable energy power plants in each of the 11 inhabitant islands in the Thousand Islands, namely the hybrid system of Solar Power Generation (PLTS), Wind Turbine Power Plant (PLTB), Diesel Power Plant (PLTD) and Crude Palm Oil (CPO) Power Plant (PLTBn CPO). The average annual solar radiation in the Thousand Islands region is 5.08 kWh/m2/day and the annual average wind speed at an altitude of 50 m is 3.29 m/s. To optimize the hybrid system modeling, the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) Pro 3.11.2 software version is used based on the lowest Net Production Cost (NPC) and Cost of Electricity (CoE) value. The study showed that 7 inhabitant islands are recommended using Hybrid PV-Wind-Diesel such as Sebira Island with percentage 59.3% (PLTS), 38.5% (PLTB) and 2.2% (PLTD) with CoE 0.178 $/kWh and NPC $1,092,096.Other 4 inhabitant islands are recommended using 100 % PLTBn CPO only such as Tidung Island with CoE 0.274 $/kWh and NPC $15,076,130.

TI  - Investigating the Potential Impact of Louisiana Coastal Restoration on the Trace Metal Geochemistry of Constructed Marshlands
AB  - Coastal restoration through diversion of suspended sediments from the Lower Mississippi River (LMR) into hydrologically isolated marshlands of Mid-Barataria Bay and Mid-Breton Sounds in southern Louisiana has the potential to mobilize lead (Pb), and other trace elements. We investigate the potential impact(s) of the diversion on marsh porewater through analysis of modern riverbank and suspended sediments, compared to sediments from pre-industrial deltaic deposits of LMR. Sequential extraction methods were used to evaluate Pb, cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) in the sediments. Our results show that metal contents are higher (e.g., 8- to 10-fold for Pb) in the modern sediments relative to pre-industrial deposits. Also, the reducible fraction, presumably iron/manganese (Fe/Mn) oxides/oxyhydroxides, is the chief reservoir of environmentally available metals. The substantially higher trace metal contents of the modern relative to pre-industrial sediments suggest that the modern sediments contain a sizeable amount of anthropogenic contributions. Furthermore, the concentration of the trace metals in the reducible fraction suggests bioavailability to marsh organisms upon reductive dissolution within the planned, constructed coastal marshes. Still, additional sediment samples from the marshlands during the diversion implementation phase will be necessary to support the preliminary findings in this contribution as it affects coastal marshes and vital local fisheries.

TI  - Ocean systems for managing the global carbon cycle
AB  - Carbon dioxide is formed in all processes utilizing fossil fuels. Controlling the emissions of CO2 from a number of processes by forming CO2 hydrates (clathrates), may be an effective approach for both absorbing CO2 from multicomponent gas streams (Flue gases, Anaerobic digester gases, etc.) and sequestering CO2 in the deep oceans. Further, ocean marine farms may be an effective process for extracting CO2 from the atmosphere and forming both valuable products and rejecting excess CO2, in the form of clathrates, to the deep ocean. Preliminary engineering analyses indicates that clathrate formation for controlling both conventional fossil fuel gaseous CO2 emissions and those associated with marine farm anaerobic digester gases may provide a meaningful control strategy for CO2 .

TI  - Research on sailing range of thermal-electric hybrid propulsion underwater glider and comparative sea trial based on energy consumption
AB  - Underwater glider is becoming an increasingly important tool for exploring the ocean. As the underwater tasks become more challenging, it puts forward higher requirements for the endurance of electric underwater gliders. This paper proposes an operation principle for the underwater glider jointly driven by the ocean thermal energy and the electrical energy, which has the advantages of both electric underwater glider and thermal underwater glider. Based on the proposed operation principle, a universal energy consumption model and sailing range equation suitable for the electric, thermal and hybrid propulsion underwater gliders are established. Taking the sailing range, sailing range difference and sailing range ratio as the evaluation indexes, the effects of configuration parameters and navigation parameters on the endurance of three underwater gliders are analyzed. The results show that the endurance and endurance advantage of hybrid propulsion underwater glider can be improved with greater volume change rate of phase change material (PCM), heavier energy carrier and smaller average power of the task sensor, and its high performance can also be maintained with a weight ratio of PCM close to the critical value. Meanwhile, it is beneficial to obtaining stronger endurance for the hybrid propulsion glider during its operation by setting larger diving depth as well as smaller gliding angle and volume change of oil within the design range. Finally, the hybrid propulsion prototype and Petrel-II electric underwater glider are deployed to carry out the comparative sea trial, which verifies the correctness of sailing range equation and the availability of prototype. The results show that the hybrid propulsion underwater glider has a better energy consumption economy than the electric underwater glider. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Attenuation of high energy marine towed-streamer noise
AB  - Marine seismic data have been traditionally contaminated by bulge waves propagating along the streamers that were generated by tugging and strumming from the vessel, paravanes, tail buoys, and lead-in cables. With the progress of streamer technology bulge-wave interference has been significantly reduced. However, weather and flow noise still affects marine seismic data. The level of cross-flow-induced noise is increased when the data are acquired during turns or along circles, like in Coil shooting, and when marine currents are strong. In this paper, we present a new technique to attenuate towed-streamer noise acquired in these conditions. The method has been used successfully to process coil and wide-azimuth data in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Brazil. Â© 2011 SEG.

TI  - Condensate banking characterization and quantification of improvement from different mitigations using pressure transient analysis: A case study in hai thach field offshore Vietnam
AB  - To successfully mitigate a near-wellbore condensate blockage, the status of the condensate blockage must be thoroughly understood. This case study proposes a new technique of pressure transient analysis (PTA) to investigate the formation and impact of condensate banking on well deliverability. This new PTA technique was successfully applied to the largest reservoir of the high-pressure high-temperature Hai Thach field, providing valuable information in designing mitigation programs. Finally, two mitigation methods (hydraulic fracturing and condensate bank removal) were investigated to evaluate their potential production enhancement. The entire production history with many buildups was matched systematically and simultaneously by PTA to determine the skin factor evolution in addition to reservoir permeability. An increasing trend of skin factor confirmed the presence of condensate blockage in the near-wellbore area and provided information about the time required for the condensate bank to form. In addition, the size of the condensate blockage was obtained from the radius of the radial composite reservoir model. Finally, improvement on production rate by two mitigation methods was examined using typical skin factors achieved by these methods. Two production wells from the main reservoir of Hai Thach field were selected for this study. From observed data, the gas rate of the first well reduced rapidly from 10 MMSCF/d to 4 MMSCF/d and the second well had a low stable rate of 3 MMSCF/d. The application of PTA revealed that skin factor of the first well dramatically increased from 0 to roughly 11 and similar behavior was also captured at the second well as this value increased from 0.5 to around 5. This upward trend of skin factor confirmed the presence of condensate blockage at near-wellbore regions of these wells and it took approximately 5 months to form the condensate bank. The radius of condensate bank was also determined at roughly 14 ft and the average permeability of these wells fall in the range of 0.2 to 0.5 mD. In addition, the mitigation analysis on two production wells showed that hydraulic fracturing and condensate bank removal methods could improve well production rate up to approximately 180% and 100%, respectively. From conventional well testing techniques, it is challenging to obtain further information of condensate bank in a near-wellbore region. This case study proposes a novel application of PTA which successfully provided in-depth knowledge of condensate blockage, such as condensate bank size and formation time. This information is crucial in designing mitigation programs to improve recovery of affected wells. The potential enhancement on production rate from different condensate banking mitigation methods was also quantified, providing valuable information on the feasibility of such mitigation jobs.

TI  - Carbon capture, utilization and storage development in Romania
AB  - Related to the Southern part of Romania, from our previous and present CCUS studies, the industrial CO2 emissions - verified on 2017, the appropriate geological structures for CO2 storage as well as oil and gas deposits for EOR and EGR, are well documented. GeoEcoMar is the single Romanian organization having in the same time high professional experience in the complex geological and geophysical studies on the Danube and the Western Black Sea Basin as well as in the CCUS studies. Evolving environmental regulatory directives have generated interest and investment to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from large point sources using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. CCS is a suite of technologies integrated to capture and transport CO2 from major point sources to a storage site where the CO2 is injected down wells and into porous geological formations deep below the surface. There it is trapped and permanently stored. CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is a promising option to move CCS forward by enabling development of carbon capture at industrial sites and pipeline infrastructure for CO2 transport. When executed synergistically, EOR and CCS are referred to as carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). CO2-EOR storage is being increasingly recognized as an important strategy for mitigating climate change. The use of CO2-EOR for purpose of geologic storage has many practical advantages. Literature and experts generally view CO2-EOR as a proven technology. Technologies and methodologies for injection, production and monitoring have been in use and refined over the past few decades. Other than CO2 supply and processing, candidate CO2-EOR sites typically have modest infrastructure demands, because in most cases existing wells can be used directly or with some modifications for injection and production. Finally, a number of monitoring methodologies for establishing the quantity of CO2 stored have been demonstrated. CO2-EOR operations are mainly monitored to check that bottom-hole and reservoir pressures are being maintained within the operational constraints, to track the movement of the CO2 injected, and to ensure that the wells are complying with integrity standards especially due to the potential for flow assurance problems stemming from the corrosive nature of CO2 in pipelines and hydrate forming hazards. Monitoring and surveillance for these objectives are usually implemented via gauges for injection/production and pressure data, geochemical analysis of produced fluids, and well logs and/or downhole sensors that measure tracer concentration, fluid saturations, resistivity and casing integrity. Seismic surveys have also been used to monitor for CO2 plume movement. Additional monitoring requirements for storage include demonstrating integrity of the producing reservoir, verification of the quantity of stored CO2, wellbore integrity monitoring, plume pathways monitoring, near-surface monitoring, and surface monitoring.

TI  - A Framework for Adopting a Sustainable Smart Sea Port Index
AB  - The new business environment, and the new era of digital transformation put pressure on the global supply chain and accordingly on ports to cope with such changes; these require ports to be smarter and adapt to the new technological approaches. Smart ports SP express the prevailing trend for the transformation strategies. Although many previous studies discuss smart ports requirements there is no integrated vision provided before to capture different comprehensive elements of smart port and show its impact on sustainably. Therefore, this research aims at developing an integrated smart port index SPI, capturing different elements of SP and linking them to port sustainability performance. The research conducted a systematic literature review to identify all pillars that are required for the smart port adaptation and showed its impact on sustainability with a full-text reading stage that resulted in 48 articles. The paper indicated that few studies of the SPI have been proposed before to improve SP activity in different domains: operations, environment, energy, safety, and security; however, there is a need to address the several key issues related to port operations, and to consider human resources factor as part of the smart port requirement, particularly an integrated index that captures different pillars in SP elements and shows its effect on sustainable performance. The study reveals that SP initiatives around the world have different integration levels. According to this, the smart port index can be considered as the first integrated index linked to sustainability and including human resources; however, there are some limitations that could be an open issue to future researchers and practitioners to foster new practical research initiatives that can rely on this index to adapt the smart port practices in different ports, taking into consideration the human resources aspect and testing their impact on port sustainability.

TI  - Rapid increase of observed DIC and pCO2 in the surface waters of the North Sea in the 2001-2011 decade ascribed to climate change superimposed by biological processes
AB  - The CO2 system in the North Sea over the 2001-2011 decade was investigated using four comprehensive basin-wide datasets covering the late summer periods of 2001, 2005, 2008 and 2011. We find that rises in surface water DIC and pCO2 exceeded concurrent rises in atmospheric pCO2, which we attribute primarily to biological activity in late summer. After accounting for this biological signal, the observed ocean acidification occurs at a rate that is consistent with concurrent atmospheric and open ocean CO2 increases over the 2001-2011 decade. Nevertheless, we do find a consistent reduction in CO2 undersaturation in the NNS and an increase in CO2 supersaturation in the SNS. We propose that the synergistic effects of increasing atmospheric pCO2 and subsequent decrease in seawater buffering capacity, together with rising sea surface temperatures in the future oceans, may reduce the strength of the North Sea as a CO2 sink. Such a reduction would diminish the efficiency of this region as a continental shelf pump with respect to uptake of CO2 by the sea. Ultimately this would constitute a positive feedback mechanism, i.e. enhancing the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO2 and thus the net rate of increase of atmospheric pCO2 and subsequent global climate change.

TI  - Sodium hydride as alternative energy having hydrogen absorption and hydrogen generation functions and hydrogen fuel cycle ã€ˆon-site sodium production for hydrogen on sea and on-demand hydrogen power generation on landã€‰
AB  - Hydrogen was converted to such a material as coal or oil with a low specific gravity so that it could be stored for a longer period and transported for a long distance at room temperature and under atmospheric pressure; which is sodium metal or sodium hydride. Sodium metal is produced with molten-salt electrolysis from seawater by wind power and transported to a thermoelectric power station in the consumption place for hydrogen-fueled combustion power generation. Sodium hydroxide, a waste, is re-electrolyzed to produce sodium for hydrogen generation; which constructs a hydrogen fuel cycle. This hydrogen fuel cycle is a clean, environmentally friendly recycle system that never requires repeated supply of raw materials in the same manner as the nuclear fuel cycle. Sodium or sodium hydride is an alternative energy. Â© 2011 Materials Research Society.

TI  - Use of computational fluid dynamics to investigate the impact of cold spots on subsea insulation performance
AB  - Hydrate management strategy of most of the latest deepwater developments relies mainly on prevention because of the inherent difficulty to deploy remediation procedures. For subsea developments relying on passive insulation, Christmas trees, manifolds, flowlines and risers are designed with thermal insulation which provides sufficient time to implement on adequate operational procedure (depressurisation / methanol flushing or crude oil displacement with dead oil). The later strategy aims at eliminating the hydrate formation risk in the production network for extended shut-down periods and facilitating production restart procedures. During the commissioning activity on the field, the thermal performance of the production system can be tested and compared to the thermal performance specification through specific procedures and measurements. Components with degraded insulation performance have measurable effects even when they have a limited surface area. When it is feasible, corrective actions can be implemented on the system to improve their insulation performance, the main difficulty being to locate the cold spots with accuracy. This paper presents the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as a tool to evaluate the impact of cold spots and convection heat transfers on the thermal performance of typical deepwater field of West Africa. The thermal modelling approach during the detailed design, the results of the thermal tests during the commissioning and investigation of potential cold spots through thermal modelling are developed.

TI  - A search for regulatory analogs to carbon sequestration
AB  - Carbon capture and sequestration will require the management and storage of carbon dioxide either in geological reservoirs or in the ocean over many centuries. While the possibility of exposure leading to damages to public health, workers or the environment may be small, it seems inevitable that if there is to be widespread adoption of sequestration, then a regulatory system will need to evolve to manage the reservoirs. To better understand the drivers of a future regulatory system, the historical evolution of comparable regulatory regimes provides a useful guide. Other long-term storage problems that have at least some of the characteristics of carbon storage are evaluated according to the nature of risk, the credibility of the solutions, the regulatory environment and the potential to either borrow from or influence other policy problems across geographic or issue boundaries. While none are exact analogs, as a whole, the set offers variation in key variables critical for determining the success of carbon sequestration as a viable climate policy option.

TI  - Increasing Costs Due to Ocean Acidification Drives Phytoplankton to Be More Heavily Calcified: Optimal Growth Strategy of Coccolithophores
AB  - Ocean acidification is potentially one of the greatest threats to marine ecosystems and global carbon cycling. Amongst calcifying organisms, coccolithophores have received special attention because their calcite precipitation plays a significant role in alkalinity flux to the deep ocean (i.e., inorganic carbon pump). Currently, empirical effort is devoted to evaluating the plastic responses to acidification, but evolutionary considerations are missing from this approach. We thus constructed an optimality model to evaluate the evolutionary response of coccolithophorid life history, assuming that their exoskeleton (coccolith) serves to reduce the instantaneous mortality rates. Our model predicted that natural selection favors constructing more heavily calcified exoskeleton in response to increased acidification-driven costs. This counter-intuitive response occurs because the fitness benefit of choosing a better-defended, slower growth strategy in more acidic conditions, outweighs that of accelerating the cell cycle, as this occurs by producing less calcified exoskeleton. Contrary to the widely held belief, the evolutionarily optimized population can precipitate larger amounts of CaCO3 during the bloom in more acidified seawater, depending on parameter values. These findings suggest that ocean acidification may enhance the calcification rates of marine organisms as an adaptive response, possibly accompanied by higher carbon fixation ability. Our theory also provides a compelling explanation for the multispecific fossil time-series record from similar to 200 years ago to present, in which mean coccolith size has increased along with rising atmospheric CO2 concentration.

TI  - Pacific Northwest moving ahead with climate change policy?
AB  - Oregon and Washington State are examining new policies to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. An extension of Oregon's Clean Fuels Program is expected at the top of the 2015 legislative agenda and, potentially, a bill to enact a carbon tax. On November 14, the Washington governor's Carbon Emissions Reduction Task Force released its report weighing the benefits of cap and trade versus a carbon tax, and a separate update of a report commissioned by the governor on clean fuels was released October 29. As members of the Pacific Coast Action Plan on Climate and Energy (PCAP), both states have committed to adopt low-carbon fuel standards and pursue carbon pricing mechanisms like cap and trade or carbon taxes. Both states will look to policy models from California and British Columbia, fellow PCAP members.

TI  - Comparative Study on Fuel Gas Supply Systems for LNG Bunkering Using Carbon Dioxide and Glycol Water
AB  - Liquified natural gas (LNG) fuel has received significant attention as an affordable and highly efficient fuel option due to strengthened regulations on the sulfur content of bunker oil put in place by the International Maritime Organization. The main component of the LNG fuel gas supply system (FGSS) is the heat exchanger that provides adequate gas temperatures and pressures required by the engine, which also has a large machinery volume compared with other equipment. Due to the volume limitation, most FGSS have been applied to new shipbuilding only. To reduce the volume of the FGSS, CO2 was considered to serve as the replacement heat medium for conventionally used glycol water during LNG gasification. The specific power consumption (SPC) in the CO2 and glycol water system was optimized using the Aspen HYSYS thermodynamic modeler toward adjusting the temperature and pressure, and the resulting sizes were compared. This study demonstrated that the CO2 heat medium resulted in a 14\% improvement in efficiency and a 7\% reduction in heat exchanger size concluding that it was the most advantageous heat medium for the LNG regasification.

TI  - The Potential Use of Exhausted Open Pit Mine Voids as Sinks for Atmospheric CO2: Insights from Natural Reedbeds and Mine Water Treatment Wetlands
AB  - Abandoned surface mine voids are often left to flood, forming pit lakes. Drawing simple but important lessons from experiences with compost-based passive remediation systems for acidic mine waters, an alternative end-use for open pit mine voids is proposed: gradual infilling with organic material, which can serve as a long-term sink for atmospheric CO2, whilst ameliorating or eventually eliminating sustained evaporative water loss and acidic water pollution. Key to the success of this approach is the suppression of methane release from organic sediments flooded with sulfate-rich mine waters: the presence of modest amounts of sulfate (which is typically abundant in mine waters) inhibits the activity of methanogenic bacteria. This explains why gas release studies of mine water treatment wetlands never report methane emissions; CO2 is the only greenhouse gas emitted, and this is clearly not at levels sufficient to undo the benefits of wetlands as net CO2 sinks. While the compete infilling of open pits with organic sediments might take a very long time, only minimal maintenance would be needed, and if carbon trading markets finally mature, a steady income stream could be obtained to cover the costs, thus extending the economic life of the mine site far beyond cessation of mining.

TI  - Implementing Vital Dynamic Capabilities to Succeed in Digital Transformation: A Multiple-Case Study in Maritime Container Shipping
AB  - Dynamic capabilities (DCs) were found to be a success factor in maritime container shipping (MCS) regarding the volatile future, leading to competitive advantages in digital transformation (DT) efforts. Despite its relevance, it remains unclear which DCs are vital for incumbent maritime organizations to succeed in DT and how DCs need to be implemented to enable DT. Referring to this research gap, this article is the first to empirically classify digital sensing, seizing, and transforming capabilities and uncover antecedents relevant to these capabilities. Thereby, we initially combine the DCs view with DT efforts in MCS, providing valuable insights for decision-makers in port authorities, carriers, and freight forwarders. Answers were sought through a cross-case analysis involving 26 experts along the maritime supply chain. The findings highlight strategic agility, innovation ecosystems, and the redesign of organizational structures the most vital second-order concepts for succeeding in DT in MCS. Implementing the identified DCs in MCS is of considerable strategic relevance, advancing the transformation of MCS into a digitalized, efficient, and sustainable industry that preliminary provides service-based offers to its customers. Consequently, this article presents a strategic basis for adapting DT roadmaps and investments in MCS, preparing incumbent MCS organizations for the digital future.

TI  - Power Delivery Capability Enhancement Strategy for MMC Under Single-Line-to-Ground Faults [æå‡ç”µç½‘å•ç›¸æŽ¥åœ°æ•…éšœæ—¶MMCåŠŸçŽ‡é€å‡ºèƒ½åŠ›çš„æ”¹è¿›æŽ§åˆ¶ç­–ç•¥]
AB  - When grid faults happen, the power delivery capability of onshore inverter-side modular multilevel converter (MMC) will decrease severely, and the DC-bus voltage will rise rapidly, which will threaten the safe operation of the high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission system. To deal with this problem, a power delivery capability enhancement strategy for inverter-side MMC under single-line-to-ground (SLG) faults is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the influence of SLG faults on the power delivery capacity of MMC with different transformer arrangements is analyzed. On this basis, an improved strategy is proposed for MMC to enhance its power delivery capability by restraining zero sequence current components. Finally, the offshore MMC based HVDC simulation system is established in the PSCAD/EMTDC environment and simulation studies are conducted. The research results show that when the proposed strategy is applied to the MMC with Y0/Y0 arrangement transformer, the power delivery capacity of the MMC can be effectively enhanced. Therefore, the required capacity of the DC chopper can be decreased, and the construction cost can be reduced remarkably. The research results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Â© 2021, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI. All right reserved.

TI  - Effects of environmental hypercapnia on fish
AB  - Increased concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere will cause not only global warming but also raised partial pressure of CO2 and lowered pH in the ocean. These environment alterations may affect fish and other marine organisms. On the other hand, feasibility studies recently suggest that disposal of anthropogenic CO2 in the deep ocean could help reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, implementation of this strategy could have a significant environmental impact on marine life. These circumstances provide a background for the urgent need of further studies concerning the effect of CO2 on fish. In this paper we summarize the literature reporting on CO2 effects on fish and discuss the required research work for the future. The present knowledge from the literature is summarized and categorized into oxygen consumption rate, respiration activity, oxygen carrying capacity by red blood cells, blood gas, blood circulation, CO2 receptor, acid-base balance, endocrine, growth, toxicity and anesthesia. Most of the experimental fish used in the literature are freshwater species (carp and rainbow trout have largely been used). There were only few examined marine species (three bottom dwelling species of elasmobranch and teleost, respectively). Since experiments have only been carried out on adult fish, experiments on reproduction and the early life stage should be performed to clarify effects over the life cycle and to predict long term hypercapnic effects. Physiological studies have mostly been concerned with the acid-base balance and we need further information on maturation and endocrine to evaluate long term hypercapnic effects on fish populations. Changes in swimming behavior and its mechanism must also be examined. Although the early phase of future study on CO2 effects on fish has to start using shallow-water species, deep-sea species should be considered in concern with the disposal of CO2 in the deep ocean. Furthermore, extrapolating data from one well researched species to evaluate implications on the ecosystem as a whole would be hazardous. In order to validate an appropriate resolution to the global warming problem, a multi-disciplinary approach to the effects of CO2 disposal utilizing specialists from fields such as marine biology, fisheries and physical oceanography is clearly necessary.

The project will serve as another "energy artery" for the country in addition to the West-East gas pipeline, which runs &gt; 4000 km from NW Xinjiang to Shanghai and began operation in 2004. If it proceeds on time, the $8.25 project will start operation at the beginning of 2010. When it is completed, the clean energy resource is expected to help reduce CO2 emission by tens of millions of tons annually. Proven reserves of the Puguang gasfield may reach 430 billion cu m by the end of 2007.

TI  - Efficient utilization of carbon to produce aromatic valencene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using mannitol as the substrate
AB  - As a promising brown macroalgal carbohydrate, mannitol has been an alternative renewable feedstock for biofuel and biochemical production, avoiding competition with food production for natural resources. In this study, we describe a cell factory of the evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on adaptive laboratory evolution that efficiently biotransforms mannitol into the high value-added sesquiterpenoid valencene. The evolved S. cerevisiae BN-91A with a series of mutations in the genome exhibited superior performance in mannitol assimilation, with the expression levels of genes involved in mannitol assimilation being dramatically upregulated by 50-480 fold. When grown on mannitol, the BN-91A strain showed a valencene titer of 17.2 mg L-1 and a carbon conversion efficiency of 1.905 mg g(-1), which were approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than those on glucose, respectively. Further analysis of the valencene synthase coding gene revealed an elevation of its gene dose and transcriptional level under mannitol conditions, which were 3-fold and 5-fold as much as those under glucose conditions, respectively. Moreover, the valencene titer of BN-91A had little to no impact upon salt shock, indicating the competence of BN-91A to produce valencene from macroalgae-derived mannitol. An improved valencene titer of 161.1 mg L-1 was obtained in flasks after applying a combinational engineering strategy including precursor supply enhancement, mannitol uptake facilitation and cofactor regeneration acceleration. Finally, a maximum valencene titer of 5.61 g L-1 was obtained in a fed-batch bioreactor with mannitol feeding. Our findings establish a novel strategy of terpenoid production in S. cerevisiae, which opens a new avenue for application of third-generation renewable biomass marine macroalgae.

TI  - Numerical analysis on utilizing excess steam for electricity production in cruise ships
AB  - Marine sector has a significant contribution to the global greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage. Despite that the energy efficiency of ship engines has been increased drastically and the usage of new type of fuels such as LNG has reduced the emissions, significant improvements in the energy efficiency of ship energy systems could be still achieved by the more effective usage of different heat streams. In this study, the potential for producing electric power from excess steam of large cruise ships is investigated. The analysis is carried out for annual operational profiles of case cruise ships and the excess steam utilization is studied by means of 0.5 MW-2 MW scale steam turbine system and a combination of steam turbine and low temperature ORC system. A notable potential in utilizing the excess steam into electricity production was identified. It was observed that due to the high variations in the ship operation, the steam turbine design power and off-design performance have a significant impact on the electrical energy production. In the studied case cruise ships, steam turbine having a low condensing temperature or a combination of steam turbine and low temperature ORC reached the highest annual electric energy production potential, ranging from 3920 MWhia to 5310 MWh/a.

TI  - The impact of CO2 clathrate hydrate on deep ocean sequestration of CO2 - Experimental observations and modeling results
AB  - CO2 clathrate hydrate is a crystalline compound that can form under temperature and pressure conditions associated with the Injection and storage of CO2 in the deep ocean (below 500 m), At depths being considered for injection of CO2 (between 1,000 and 1,500 m), in the absence of hydrate formation, the buoyant CO2 would simply rise as it dissolved in the seawater. If, however, the hydrate phase forms, it will affect this process. The impact could be positive or negative, depending on how hydrate forms and whether it Is associated with undissolved CO2. This paper summarizes experimental and theoretical information relating to formation conditions for the hydrate, the relative density of the hydrate, the formation of a hydrate shell on drops of liquid CO2, and the impact that a hydrate shell has on dissolution of CO2. The future direction of the work is also briefly described.

TI  - Long term carbon storage potential and CO2 sink strength of a restored salt marsh in New Jersey
AB  - The study compares the amounts of carbon fixed via photosynthesis of a restored tidal marsh to the total organic carbon remaining in sediments of a natural tidal marsh and arrives at preliminary baselines for carbon sequestration and storage over time. The Eddy-covariance method (indirect method) was used to estimate marsh canopy net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and measured an annual gross primary production of 979 g C m(-2), while the loss through respiration was 766g Cm-2, resulting in a net uptake of 213 g Cm-2 yr(-1). Time of the day, solar irradiation, air temperature, humidity and wind direction all together explained 66\% of the variation in NEE. The high marsh community of Spartina patens showed NEE to be significantly higher than the low marsh community. The net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) over long time scales was estimated by measuring the actual amount of total organic carbon contained in dated sediment cores from a natural marsh (direct method), which resulted in a carbon accumulation rate of 192.2 g m(-2) yr(-1). Changes in total organic carbon content over time in the core sample showed that 78\% of organic carbon remained stored in the sediments after 130 years and only the most recalcitrant carbon (50\%) remained under storage beyond 645 years. Overall the study showed that temperate macrotidal salt marshes are net sinks of carbon with potential for long term carbon storage. The marsh turned into a carbon sink at the beginning of May and switched back to being a source in late November. The average sedimentation rate estimated from the 137 CS dating (1950s to present) was 1.4 mm yr(-1) which is similar to accretion rates of comparable S. patens patches in the east coast. Accretion rates derived from our study are slightly lower than the 60+ year rate of sea level rise (2.6 mm yr(-1)) recorded by tide gauge measurements in the Northeast. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - In situ carbonation of peridotite for CO2 storage
AB  - The rate of natural carbonation of tectonically exposed mantle peridotite during weathering and low-temperature alteration can be enhanced to develop a significant sink for atmospheric CO2. Natural carbonation of peridotite in the Samail ophiolite, an uplifted slice of oceanic crust and upper mantle in the Sultanate of Oman, is surprisingly rapid. Carbonate veins in mantle peridotite in Oman have an average C-14 age of approximate to 26,000 years, and are not 30-95 million years old as previously believed. These data and reconnaissance mapping show that approximate to 10(4) to 10(5) tons per year of atmospheric CO2 are converted to solid carbonate minerals via peridotite weathering in Oman. Peridotite carbonation can be accelerated via drilling, hydraulic fracture, input of purified CO2 at elevated pressure, and, in particular, increased temperature at depth. After an initial heating step, CO2 pumped at 25 or 30 degrees C can be heated by exothermic carbonation reactions that sustain high temperature and rapid reaction rates at depth with little expenditure of energy. In situ carbonation of peridotite could consume > 1 billion tons of CO2 per year in Oman alone, affording a low-cost, safe, and permanent method to capture and store atmospheric CO2.

TI  - Predicting landscape effects of Mississippi River diversions on soil organic carbon sequestration
AB  - Large Mississippi River (MR) diversions (peak water flow > 1416 m(3)/s and sediment loads > 165 kg/s) have been proposed as part of a suite of coastal restoration projects and are expected to rehabilitate and rebuild wetlands to alleviate the significant historic wetland loss in coastal Louisiana. These coastal wetlands are undergoing increasing eustatic sea-level rise, land subsidence, climate change, and anthropogenic disturbances. However, the effect of MR diversions on wetland soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in receiving basins remains unknown. The rate of SOC sequestration or carbon burial in wetlands is one of the variables used to assess the role of wetland soils in carbon cycling and also to construct wetland carbon budgets. In this study, we examined the effects of MR water and sediment diversions on landscape-scale SOC sequestration rates that were estimated from vertical accretion for the next 50 yr (2010-2060) under two environmental (moderate and less optimistic) scenarios. Our analyses were based on model simulations taken from the Wetland Morphology model developed for Louisiana's 2012 Coastal Master Plan. The master plan modeled a ``future-without-action{''} scenario as well as eight individual MR diversion projects in two of the hydrologic basins (Barataria and Breton Sound). We examined the effects that discharge rates (peak flow) and locations of these individual diversion projects had on SOC sequestration rates. Modeling results indicate that large river diversions are capable of improving basin-wide SOC sequestration capacity (162-222 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)) by up to 14\% (30 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)) in Louisiana deltaic wetlands compared to the future-without-action scenario, especially under the less optimistic scenario. When large river diversions are placed in the upper receiving basin, SOC sequestration rates are 3.7-10.5\% higher (6-24 g C.m(-2).yr(-1)) than when these structures are placed in the lower receiving basin. Modeling results also indicate that both diversion discharge and location have large effects on SOC sequestration in low-salinity (freshwater and intermediate marshes) as compared to high-salinity marshes (brackish and saline marshes).

TI  - Oil production and reservoir damage during miscible CO2 injection
AB  - The blockage and alteration of wettability in reservoirs caused by asphaltene deposits are problems that contribute to poor oil recovery performance during carbon dioxide (CO2) injection. Oil production and reservoir damage are both controlled by macroscopic interlayer heterogeneity and microscopic pore-throat structure and may be optimized by the choice of flooding method. In this work, the residual oil distribution and the permeability decline caused by organic and inorganic precipitation after miscible CO2 flooding and water-alternating-CO2 (CO2-WAG) flooding have been studied by carrying out core-flooding experiments on a model heterogeneous three-layer reservoir. For CO2, flooding experimental results indicate that the low-permeability layers retain a large oil production potential even in the late stages of production, while the permeability decline due to formation damage is larger in the high-permeability layer. We found that CO2-WAG can reduce the influence of heterogeneity on the oil production, but it results in more serious reservoir damage, with permeability decline caused by CO2-brine-rock interactions becoming significant. In addition, miscible CO2 flooding has been carried out for rocks with similar permeabilities but different wettabilities and different pore-throat microstructures in order to study the effects of wettability and pore-throat microstructure on formation damage. Reservoir rocks with smaller pore-throat sizes and more heterogeneous pore-throat microstructures were found to be more sensitive to asphaltene precipitation, with corresponding lower oil recovery and greater decreases in permeability. However, it was found that the degree of water wetness for cores with larger, more connected pore-throat microstructures became weaker due to asphaltene precipitation to pore surfaces. Decreasing the degree of water wetness was found to be exacerbated by increases in the sweep volume of injected CO2 that arise from cores with larger and better connected pore throats. Erosion of water wetness is a disadvantage for enhanced oil recovery operations as asphaltene precipitation prevention and control measures become more necessary.

SPM2010 solves mass/momentum/energy balances of permeate and retentate non-isothermal, non-isobaric compressible flows rendering several graphical results. The second topic comprehends simulation models of membrane-permeation units appropriate for insertion in gas processing flowsheets solved by professional process simulators, such as HYSYS 10.0. These HYSYS extension models are grouped into two types, both solving mass/energy balances of permeate/retentate for hollow-fiber and spiral-wound membranes: (i) Lumped models for parallel and counter-current permeate/retentate flows using average driving forces and lumped balances; (ii) one-dimensional distributed models for parallel permeate/retentate flows using distributed driving forces and balances. The major findings of this chapter correspond to the development of two categories of membrane-permeation models (respectively, in Sects. 2 and 3), respectively, appropriate for two computing platformsâ€”MATLAB and HYSYSâ€”and sufficiently accurate for designing real permeation systems for CO2 removal from CO2-rich natural gas at high pressure. Both categories of models were calibrated with real data of CO2 permeation batteries belonging to offshore rigs operating in the pre-salt basin in the southeast coast of Brazil.

TI  - Geoengineering: Governance and technology policy
AB  - As a participant in several international agreements on climate change, the United States has joined with other nations to express concern about climate change. However, at the national level the United States has not yet developed a comprehensive climate change policy. In the absence of a comprehensive policy direction, technological advances are creating alternatives to the traditional approaches to climate change (mitigation and adaptation). If deployed, these new technologies could modify the Earth's climate on a large scale. Moreover, these new technologies may become available to foreign governments and entities in the private sector to use unilaterally-without authorization from the United States government or an international treaty. The term ?geoengineering? describes this array of technologies that aim, through large-scale and deliberate modifications of the Earth's energy balance, to reduce temperatures and counteract anthropogenic climate change. Most of these technologies are at the conceptual and research stages, and their effectiveness at reducing global temperatures has yet to be proven. Moreover, very few studies have been published that document the cost, environmental effects, sociopolitical impacts, and legal implications of geoengineering. If geoengineering technologies were to be deployed, they are expected to have the potential to cause significant transboundary effects. In general, geoengineering technologies are categorized as either a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) method or a solar radiation management (SRM) method. CDR methods address the warming effects of greenhouse gases by removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. CDR methods include ocean fertilization, and carbon capture and sequestration. SRM methods address climate change by increasing the reflectivity of the Earth's atmosphere or surface. Aerosol injection and space-based reflectors are examples of SRM methods. SRM methods do not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, but can be deployed faster with relatively immediate global cooling results compared to CDR methods. In addition to seeking an understanding of the science behind the different geoengineering technologies, policymakers are considering policies and strategies for addressing geoengineering at the national and international levels. To date, there is limited federal involvement in, or oversight of, geoengineering. However, some states as well as some federal agencies, notably the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Defense, have taken actions related to geoengineering research or projects. At the international level, there is no international agreement or organization governing the full spectrum of possible geoengineering activities. Nevertheless, provisions of many international agreements, including those relating to climate change, maritime pollution, and air pollution, would likely inform the types of geoengineering activities that state parties to these agreements might choose to pursue. In 2010, the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted provisions calling for member parties to abstain from geoengineering unless the parties have fully considered the risks and impacts of those activities on biodiversity. With the possibility that geoengineering technologies may be developed and climate change remains an issue of global concern, policymakers may determine whether geoengineering is an issue that warrants attention at either the federal or international level. If so, policymakers will also need to consider whether geoengineering can be effectively addressed by amendments to existing laws and international agreements or, alternatively, whether new laws and international treaties would need to be developed.

TI  - Trenching considerations for arctic pipelines
AB  - Offshore pipelines installed in the Arctic and other cold regions are often buried to reduce the risk of damage from ice gouging, upheaval buckling, and other loading challenges specific to the region. Pipeline burial is normally achieved through trench excavation and backfill. Pipelines have been buried using a wide variety of technologies including conventional excavation equipment, hydraulic dredges, ploughs, mechanical trenchers, and jetters. In order to determine a preferred trenching method for a particular route, consideration must be given to a variety of factors. The water depth range and maximum trench depth required along a route are primary considerations when evaluating the various trenching technologies. These are "show stopper" route parameters, which have a direct impact on the ability to complete a particular trench. If multiple trenching technologies satisfy the primary considerations, a variety of secondary considerations must be used to determine the preferred solution. These include parameters such as seabed geology, backfill method, seabed slopes, and environmental sensitivity. The preferred solution may not always be the only method of excavating the trench, but it may have an advantage compared to other technologies for the route under evaluation. As developments are proposed for areas that experience relatively deep ice gouging (up to 5m), burial depth requirements will exceed the capabilities of current technologies. New technologies capable of working in deeper water, achieving greater burial depths, achieving reasonable trenching advance rates, operating in harsh environments, and trenching through variable and difficult seabed soils will be required.

TI  - Deforested Mangroves Affect the Potential for Carbon Linkages between Connected Ecosystems
AB  - Mangrove forests are important sinks and sources of carbon especially for connections to coral reefs and seagrass beds. However, they are increasing under threat from anthropogenic influences. We investigated correlations between carbon fluxes from the sediment and water column in deforested and intact mangroves. Our findings show that deforestation has a negative effect on sediment organic carbon storage and CO2 fluxes. However, species richness and density showed a positive correlation with sediment organic carbon storage and CO2 fluxes. An increased density of saplings showed a positive relationship with dissolved inorganic and organic carbon draining the mangrove forest at high tide. This research offers insights into the importance of the key forest characteristics influencing the storage and fluxes of carbon. Alterations in mangrove carbon stocks and retention may affect connected ecosystems.

TI  - Ceramic screens - An innovative downhole sand control solution for old and challenging cased hole completions
AB  - Erosion in gas wells caused by sand producing formations can result in severe operational issues leading to the degradation of surface and downhole equipment and the shutdown of production facilities at surface. Old cased hole wells in highly unconsolidated, poorly sorted sandstone formations require robust sand control. In such instances, conventional gravel packing methods are not always possible and the installation and maintenance of downhole sand control throughout the well life can be challenging. In gas wells where sand velocities are high, the supporting metallic material being used in, for example standalone sand control screens is subject to plugging and subsequent rapid wear because of its low resistance to erosion. Hence the longevity of metallic sand control equipment is poor and frequent expensive re-completions and workovers are required. An innovative solution using ceramic screens was used in an existing gas well in Bolivia, South America. The well geometry included double casing with sub-optimal cement across the target zone and, due to the complexity of voids behind the casing, it was not possible to perform the initial option of a cased-hole gravel pack. In addition to sand control the completion required mechanical zonal isolation to prevent water ingress at a later stage. In summary the project involved removing the existing completion, isolating deeper lying depleted producing zones, clearing the casing of debris, re-perforating the casing, installing a new completion with ceramic screens and zonal isolation valves. BG Group in conjunction with German ceramics manufacturer ESK developed over a period of 18 months a series of ceramic sand control screens and sliding sleeve protections that provided a downhole sand control completion solution complete with mechanical water isolation. The successful project exceeded all expectations and to date the well has produced sand free. The operational time and re-completion costs were less than of a cased-hole gravel pack, the operation much simpler and safer. BG are now working on a project to use this innovative technology as a thru-tubing sand control solution for existing high rate gas wells offshore worldwide where open hole or cased hole gravel packs have failed.

TI  - SOURCE OR SINK? A REVIEW OF THE CO2 FLUXES AT THE BRAZILIAN CONTINENTAL SHELF
AB  - Studies of global carbon balance estimates are still incipient in the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere, mainly in coastal areas and continental shelf. Even in Brazil, despite its continental proportion coastline, there is still a great inconsistency in studies on the marine carbonate system and CO2 fluxes at the air-sea interface. This article presents a review of studies on CO2 fluxes on the coast of Brazil, published between the years 2000 and 2022, aiming to map the distribution of CO2 fluxes on the Brazilian continental shelf, to understand its role as a source or sink of CO2. In general, large-scale studies show that the Brazilian shelf exhibits a latitudinal variation of air-sea CO2 fluxes, behaving mainly as a source in the north, where there is no influence of the Amazon River plume, and as a sink in the south portion. We also identified there is a strong influence on the occurrence of mesoscale and synoptic oceanographic and meteorological events, and the presence of different ecosystems, which can change the behavior of CO2 fluxes locally. However, there are still many data gaps along the continental shelf, as well as in different seasons for the entire coast.

TI  - Power from marine sediment fuel cells: The influence of anode material
AB  - The effect of anode material on the performance of microbial fuel cells (MFC), which utilise oxidisable carbon compounds and other components present in sediments on ocean floors, estuaries and other similar environments is reported. The MFC anode materials were carbon sponge, carbon cloth, carbon fibre, and reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC). Power was produced through the microbial activity at the anode in conjunction with, principally, oxygen reduction at a graphite cloth cathode. After a period of stabilisation, open circuit voltages up to 700 mV were observed for most cells. Steady state polarisations gave maximum power densities of 55 mW m-2 using carbon sponge as the anode; which was nearly twice that achieved with carbon cloth. The latter material typically gave power densities of around 20 mW m-2. The performance of the cell was reduced by operation at a low temperature of 5 Â°C. Generally, for cells which were capable of generating power at current densities of 100 mA m-2 and greater, mass transport was found to limit both the anode and the cathode performance, due primarily to the low concentrations of electro-active species present or generated in cells.

TI  - Effect of high pressure high temperature condition on well design development in offshore Vietnam
AB  - Two fields are of Hai Thach and Moc Tinh of the Block 5.2 and Block 5.3 in offshore Vietnam have been discovered and exploited of the oil and gas production since the middle 90s. At this time, many contractors will be drilled wells development in the fields with 16 wells by using Tender Assist Drilling (TAD). There are high-temperature, high-pressure (HPHT) in the two fields with the bottom hole temperature range from 140 Ã‚Â°C to 175 Ã‚Â°C and the bottom hole pressure range from 10,000 psi to 11,500 psi. Through drilling and construction wells have been met many problems related to high pressure high temperature wells. Especially in the discovery well and appraisal wells in high pressure, high temperature reservoir (HPHT), There are a lot of incidents and operating technical problems during drilling. One of the problems during drilling is the gas influx into the wellbore due to the abnormal pore pressure, shallow gas, fluid loss due to the fracture pressure and pore pressure is very narrow margin, stuck down hole equipment in the wellbore due to high differential pressure between hydrostatic pressure and pore pressure and another problem was related to drilling mud and cement. At the stage of wells developemnt, the biggest challenges deal with design HPHT wells, which are required to high efficiency during drilling, construction wells and also require to bottom hole assembly working for a long time and a safe in the reservoir condition of high-pressure, high-temperature. Although the principal design HPHT wells was not different to principal conventional wells, but that well was still potentially risky and very challenging because of the strict design HPHT wells have not much been to choice materials and equipment. This study has been presented in detail the difficulties, solutions, and the effect of high -pressure, high-temperature on wells design development in HPHT conditions such as Casing design and selection grade, the differential pressure between reservoir pressure and fracture pressure is a narrow equivalent circulating density (ECD) management, laboratory the effect of temperature on rheological properties and model behavior of drilling fluid by using V35 fann, selection drilling mud in drilling wells HPHT conditions.

TI  - Diesel Based SOFC Demonstrator for Maritime Applications
AB  - Emission regulations for ships are forcing ship-owners and shipyards to drastically reduce harmful species for the Emission Control Areas (ECA) along the US coast, Baltic Sea and North Sea. SOFC systems are seen as most efficient and clean alternative to conventional diesel engines. A diesel based SOFC demonstrator is developed with a rated power of around 50 kW. It consists of 2 submodules supplying each 27 kW gross power. The key feature of the process is the adiabatic prereforming process that allows us to handle the diesel without any deep desulphurization technologies. Adiabatic prereforming of diesel is one of the most efficient types of fuel processing for SOFC systems. The feasibility of adiabatic prereforming of commercial ultra-low sulphur diesel has successfully been tested with one of Haldor Topsoe's catalyst. The demonstrator was started on commercial road diesel containing 11.3 ppm\_wt sulphur, 6.2\%\_vol FAME and 24\%\_wt aromatics. An electrical gross efficiency of 55\% and fuel utilization of 73\% could be demonstrated already during the first hours of operation.

TI  - Macronutrient cycles and climate change: Key science areas and an international perspective
AB  - Human activities have doubled global cycles of Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) and elevated N and P have compromised ecosystem services through the degradation of natural resources of soils, freshwaters and marine waters with a subsequent loss of biodiversity. Elevated Carbon (C) levels in the atmosphere have been linked to global warming, with positive feedback mechanisms accelerating the warming process. In order to initiate nutrient control, both national and international mitigation measures have been implemented. However, many of these initiatives focus upon a single nutrient without considering cycle interactions. A sound understanding of processes and transformations involved in the interactions of macronutrient cycles is required to avoid inadvertently enhancing effects of one nutrient, during mitigation for impacts of another. Emerging research initiatives are addressing these research gaps, with programmes in the US (USGCRP) and the UK (Macronutrient Cycles) advocating integration between scientists and stakeholders, in order to deliver results directly to policy makers. Through these programmes the scales of nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes will be quantified, and a determination made of the nature of nutrient transformations in catchments under a changing climate and perturbed carbon cycle. The consideration of connectivity between multiple macronutrient cycles will help to minimise the threats to biodiversity, ecosystem dynamics, public water supplies and human health by improved management and better focused policy.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration in the Form of Recalcitrant Dissolved Organic Carbon in a Seaweed (Kelp) Farming Environment
AB  - Under climate change scenarios, the contribution of macroalgae to carbon sequestration has attracted wide attention. As primary producers, macroalgae can release substantial amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in seawater. However, little is known about the molecular composition and chemical properties of DOC derived from macroalgae and which of them are recalcitrant DOC (RDOC) that can be sequestered for a long time in the ocean. In the most intensive seaweed (kelp) farming area (Sanggou Bay) in China, we found that kelp mariculture not only significantly increased DOC concentration, but also introduced a variety of new DOC molecular species, many of which were sulfur-containing molecules. A long-term DOC degradation experiment revealed that those DOC with strong resistance to microbial degradation, i.e., RDOC, account for approximately 58% of the DOC extracted from kelp mariculture area. About 85% (3587 out of 4224 with different chemical features) of the RDOC molecular species were steadily present throughout the long-term degradation process. 15% (637 out of 4224 with different chemical features) of the RDOC molecular species were likely newly generated by microorganisms after metabolizing macroalgae-derived labile DOC. All these stable RDOC should be included in the blue carbon budgets of seaweed. Â© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

TI  - Class can solve LNG fuel problems
AB  - The use of LNG as a fuel for passenger ships is currently attracting interest because the fuel is comparatively clean, eliminating SO x emissions and reducing NO x and CO 2 pollution by âˆ¼ 80 and 20%, respectively, and it is also cheap in comparison to the present oil prices. Bureau Veritas is working on solutions for LNG use in passenger vessels. A big issue for passenger ships that want to use LNG as a secondary fuel is finding sufficient space suitably located for the LNG storage. It may be above or below deck, in independent type B tanks for large capacity cold storage or type C pressurized tanks for limited capacity such as for short sea shipping. Technical solutions to install gas fuel engines in passenger vessels are in place, but there are still issues, including regulatory ones, to address. Bureau Veritas has recently updated NR 529 "Safety of gas-fuelled ships" and is working together with shipyards, operators and engine manufacturers to use LNG fuelled solutions to deliver what passengers and owners want.

TI  - Monitoring ship noise to assess the impact of coastal developments on marine mammals
AB  - The potential impacts of underwater noise on marine mammals are widely recognised, but uncertainty over variability in baseline noise levels often constrains efforts to manage these impacts. This paper characterises natural and anthropogenic contributors to underwater noise at two sites in the Moray Firth Special Area of Conservation, an important marine mammal habitat that may be exposed to increased shipping activity from proposed offshore energy developments. We aimed to establish a pre-development baseline, and to develop ship noise monitoring methods using Automatic Identification System (AIS) and time-lapse video to record trends in noise levels and shipping activity. Our results detail the noise levels currently experienced by a locally protected bottlenose dolphin population, explore the relationship between broadband sound exposure levels and the indicators proposed in response to the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, and provide a ship noise assessment toolkit which can be applied in other coastal marine environments.

TI  - Physiological Responses of Avicennia marina var. acutissima and Bruguiera parviflora under Simulated Rise in Sea Level
AB  - Climate change components such as increased in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and rising sea levels are likely to affect mangrove ecosystems. Healthy mature propagules of A. marina var. acutissima and B. parviflora were subjected to two tidal treatments; shallow and deep; for six months. Shallow treatment mimicked the current tidal fluctuations and deep treatment simulated future tidal conditions under rise in sea level. Deep treatment decreased A(max) of both species and significant two way interactions between tidal treatments and species were observed. A(400) was significantly reduced in the deep treatment in B. parviflora but not in A. marina. Carbon dioxide compensation point was not affected by the tidal treatments but varied significantly between both species. The ratio A(400)/A(max) was significantly lower in the shallow treatment in B. parviflora indicating higher carbon sink potential at moderate tidal flooding whereas A(400)/A(max) of A. marina was less variable between tidal treatments. Chlorophyll conductance was insensitive to tidal flooding but was significantly higher in B. parviflora than in A. marina. Carbon sequestration of B. parviflora was substantially reduced in the deep treatment while the difference between tidal treatments was much less in A. marina. These results indicated that these two species responded differently under tidal flooding where A. marina was less sensitive to tidal. Thus, A. marina is better adapted to the projected climate change than B. parviflora.

TI  - Flexible control of nuclear cogeneration plants for balancing intermittent renewables
AB  - Both intermittent renewable energy (IRE) and nuclear fission energy can provide carbon-free electric power to the grid. The electric power generation from the intermittent renewable energy (IRE) sources such as the wind and solar are strongly dependent on the climatic conditions, geographical location and large land footprint. While, nuclear plants can provide consistent and clean power supply with small land footprint. Due to the strong complementarity between the IRE and nuclear, it is attractive to interconnect them to build nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems (NRHESs) which are defined as the integrated facilities comprised of nuclear reactors, renewable energy generation and industrial processes. The flexibility of a NRHES for grid balance can be provided by actively adjusting the electric power output of nuclear cogeneration plants (NCPs), which leads to the frequent redistribution of main steam flow to the turbine and cogeneration process. For the main steam redistribution, it is necessary to guarantee the stability of grid frequency and main steam pressure, which heavily relies on the flexible control strategy of NCPs. In this paper, a new flexible control of NCPs with saturated main steam is proposed based on the idea of actively suppressing the total disturbance to the dynamics of grid frequency and main steam pressure. The stabilization problems of pressure and frequency are transferred to the disturbance attenuation Problem of a second-order disturbed dynamical system, and an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is then originally proposed for system stabilization. This ADRC is applied to the flexible control of a NCP composed of a nuclear heating reactor (NHR), a turbine-generator set and a multi-effect-desalination and thermal-vapor-compression (MED-TVC) process for seawater desalination. Numerical simulation results in the cases of load stepping and maneuvering show that the flexibility of this NCP is satisfactory in balancing the grid. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Positive contribution of macrofaunal biodiversity to secondary production and seagrass carbon metabolism
AB  - Coastal vegetated habitats such as seagrasses are known to play a critical role in carbon cycling and the potential to mitigate climate change, as blue carbon habitats have been repeatedly highlighted. However, little information is known about the role of associated macrofauna communities on the dynamics of critical processes of seagrass carbon metabolism (e.g., respiration, turnover, and production). We conducted a field study across a spatial gradient of seagrass meadows involving variable environmental conditions and macrobenthic diversity to investigate (1) the relationship between macrofauna biodiversity and secondary production (i.e., consumer incorporation of organic matter per time unit), and (2) the role of macrofauna communities in seagrass organic carbon metabolism (i.e., respiration and primary production). We show that, although several environmental factors influence secondary production, macrofauna biodiversity controls the range of local seagrass secondary production. We demonstrate that macrofauna respiration rates were responsible for almost 40% of the overall seafloor community respiration. Macrofauna represented on average >25% of the total benthic organic C stocks, high secondary production that is likely to become available to upper trophic levels of the coastal food web. Our findings support the role of macrofauna biodiversity in maintaining productive ecosystems, implying that biodiversity loss due to ongoing environmental change yields less productive seagrass ecosystems. Therefore, the assessment of carbon dynamics in coastal habitats should include associated macrofauna biodiversity elements if we aim to obtain robust estimates of global carbon budgets required to implement management actions for the sustainable functioning of the world's coasts.

TI  - Direct disposal of liquified fossil fuel carbon dioxide in the ocean
AB  - Growing awareness of the impending effects on climate of increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere has generated wide debate at an international level that is directed towards a variety of CO2 control strategies. Of these, direct disposal of liquid CO2 into the deep ocean offers a number of potential advantages: the oceanic reservoir is very large, and has the ability to buffer chemical changes caused by CO2 addition. In addition, time scales of mixing in the ocean are very long. This paper reviews some of the scientific evidence associated with this emerging form of global engineering, and discusses some of the important concepts in terms of the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Quantification of blue carbon in seagrass ecosystems of Southeast Asia and their potential for climate change mitigation
AB  - Seagrasses have the ability to contribute towards climate change mitigation, through large organic carbon (Corg) sinks within their ecosystems. Although the importance of blue carbon within these ecosystems has been addressed in some countries of Southeast Asia, the regional and national inventories with the application of nature-based solutions are lacking. In this study, we aim to estimate national coastal blue carbon stocks in the seagrass ecosystems in the countries of Southeast Asia including the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India. This study further assesses the potential of conservation and restoration practices and highlights the seagrass meadows as nature-based solution for climate change mitigation. The average value of the total carbon storage within seagrass meadows of this region is 121.95 Â± 76.11 Mg haâˆ’1 (average Â± SD) and the total Corg stock of the seagrass meadows of this region was 429.11 Â± 111.88 Tg, with the highest Corg stock in the Philippines (78%). The seagrass meadows of this region have the capacity to accumulate 5.85â€“6.80 Tg C yearâˆ’1, which accounts for $214.6â€“249.4 million USD. Under the current rate of decline of 2.82%, the seagrass meadows are emitting 1.65â€“2.08 Tg of CO2 yearâˆ’1 and the economic value of these losses accounts for $21.42â€“24.96 million USD. The potential of the seagrass meadows to the offset current CO2 emissions varies across the region, with the highest contribution to offset is in the seagrass meadows of the Philippines (11.71%). Current national policies and commitments of nationally determined contributions do not include blue carbon ecosystems as climate mitigation measures, even though these ecosystems can contribute up to 7.03% of the countries' reduction goal of CO2 emissions by 2030. The results of this study highlight and promote the potential of the southeast Asian seagrass meadows to national and international agencies as a practical scheme for nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation.

TI  - Changes in offshore electrical installation practices: revisions to API RP 14F
AB  - The American Petroleum Institute's Recommended Practice for Design and Installation of Electrical Systems for Offshore Petroleum Facilities, API RP 14F, underwent extensive revision in 1998. Advances in offshore deepwater drilling and production technology have led to increase use of floating production facilities, requiring significant interface with the United States Coast Guard (USCG). Many of the revisions made to RP 14F address USCG requirements as they apply to floating production and drilling facilities. In addition, the RP was updated to reflect advances in technology in the electrical industry. The significant revisions and the history of RP 14F will be reviewed in this paper.

TI  - Efficient fatigue assessment in the time domain in comparison to spectral fatigue analysis of an offshore jacket structure
AB  - Industry codes require inspections of critical joints within certain intervals to ensure the structural integrity of fixed offshore structures and suggest the use of spectral fatigue analyses to identify them. Inspections of fixed offshore platforms routinely show very few signs of degradation at the joints identified by the recommended computational methods, however. This illustrates the low degree of accuracy of these methods. The uncertainties involved in the fatigue assessment of fixed offshore structures have stimulated a continuous improvement of the techniques used to assess fatigue resistance. Industry codes have replaced early deterministic fatigue analyses with spectral techniques. These are considered less reliable but more efficient than approaches in the time domain, which are generally considered highly accurate but computationally unfeasible. This paper evaluates both the time and the frequency domain approach using a large platform as an example. The results obtained from a computationally excessive full-scale time domain fatigue assessment quantify the errors resulting from the assumptions and simplifications made in spectral fatigue analyses. These findings also indicate that the simplifications involved lead not only to the well-known inaccuracy but also to a lower fatigue resistance prediction. Our results confirm that spectral methods are very conservative for offshore structures, especially those that are sensitive to dynamic excitation. This excessive conservatism can lead to unnecessary and costly inspections. The analysis in the time domain, by comparison, is more accurate and recent developments show that methods based on approximation of fatigue damage exist that make fatigue assessments in the time domain computationally feasible. This paper shows the main causes of the inaccuracies of the spectral method and quantifies them. It also shows the advantage of using the approximated time domain fatigue analysis, which makes this method feasible for use during design projects. Performing fatigue analyses in the time rather than frequency domain increases the accuracy and the reliability of the results and extends the fatigue life of the joints of the structure since several conservative assumptions are eliminated.

TI  - Emergency carbon management: Geoengineering
AB  - Geoengineering is a set of radical contingency actions to deliberately modify the Earthâ€™s energy balance in order to counteract the adverse impact of human activities on the global ecosystem and climate. The Greenhouse Gas Management (GGM) is one of the main geoengineering strategies aiming at reducing the atmospheric CO2 levels within a reasonable time frame by enhancing an uptake and storage of carbon through a variety of biological (e.g., ocean fertilization) and chemical (e.g., enhanced weathering) engineered systems. Today, geoengineering remains a highly controversial issue; among major concerns are possible unintended planetary-scale adverse ecological impacts of the projects, and the disputable benefits of the geoengineering approach compared to other carbon mitigation strategies. Geoengineering poses acute and novel challenges that would require international cooperation, transparency, and the proactive and effective managing of research. The current status of major GGM geoengineering projects, their technical feasibility and economics, the challenges and risks associated with their global deployment are analyzed in this chapter.

TI  - Mapping observations using AUV and numerical simulations of leaked CO2 diffusion in sub-seabed CO2 release experiment at Ardmucknish Bay
AB  - A controlled sub-seabed CO2 release experiment (QICS: quantifying and monitoring potential impacts of geological carbon storage) was conducted in Ardmucknish Bay, Scotland, in 2012, to quantify the effect of leaked CO2 on marine environments. In this experiment, CO2 was injected beneath the seafloor, and closely monitored as the CO2 was allowed to leak into the overlying water column. We performed mapping observations using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with sensors to monitor physical and chemical conditions in the vicinity of the CO2 leakage. We also numerically simulated the behavior of the low-pH plume caused by the CO2 leakage, within the calculated tidal current in the bay. The results of AUV mapping observations showed that physical and chemical characteristics of the water mass in Ardmucknish bay are sensitive to tidal variations (low or high tide), and the ascent speed of the leaked CO2 bubble and the pH decrease in the vicinity of the CO2 leakage area are predominantly controlled by the tidal phase in the bay. The observations using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) installed in the AUV indicated that the current in the bay flows westwards at high tide and eastwards at low tide. The simulated tidal current agreed well with the tidal current observed by ADCP. Numerical simulation suggested that the pH decrease due to the leaked CO2 is restricted to the vicinity of the CO2 leakage area, and fluctuates greatly with tidal variations. In flood tide periods, diffusion of the low-pH plume caused by the leaked CO2 is barely detectable because low-pH seawater intrudes into the bay from the bay mouth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Energy Optimization of Automatic Hybrid Sailboat
AB  - Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) provide an effective way to actualize applications such as environment monitoring, search and rescue, and scientific researches. However, the conventional ASVs depends overly on the stored energy. Hybrid Sailboat, mainly powered by the wind, can solve this problem by using an auxiliary propulsion system. The electric energy cost of Hybrid Sailboat needs to be optimized to achieve the ocean automatic cruise mission. Based on adjusted setting on sails and rudders, this paper seeks the optimal trajectory for autonomic cruising to reduce the energy cost by changing the heading angle of sailing upwind. The experiment results validate the heading angle accounts for energy cost and the trajectory with the best heading angle saves up to 23.7\% than other conditions. Furthermore, the energy-time line can be used to predict the energy cost for long-time sailing.

TI  - Competitiveness advancement strategy for offshore plant construction: In terms of productivity and simulation
AB  - Global shipbuilding industries are going through the substantial change after the global financial crisis, then the Korean shipbuilding companies (mostly common carrier constructors) are being in dangerous situation. Current competitiveness of the global shipbuilding industry is moving to China based on the low labor cost. Whereupon, Korean shipbuilding industry, with heavy industry as the central figure, are trying to rise the portion of the offshore plant construction for the purpose of resource development of deep sea. Meanwhile, the most outdated part of the offshore plant business of Korea is zoomed in on the development technology including FEED (Front End Engineering development) and deep water floaters comparing with the advanced companies of USA and Europe. This made the domestic government invest most of the R&D funds in product and equipment development field. However, huge loss of mega shipbuilders such as Samsung, Hyundai and Daewoo is occurring at construction stages owing to the big delay of production processes while the development engineering are being supported by foreign engineering companies. These tremendous financial losses is thought to spring from absence of management capability with respect to the huge quantity and complex outfitting works of topside structure. In this paper, we are going to investigate the strategy for the advancement of the production management fit for offshore plant business. Then, robust and sustainable technical roadmap is going to be described based on current IT technologies and simulation based management methods.

TI  - Successful approaches for a red seaweed biorefinery
AB  - Macroalgae have been commercially exploited as food and for the production of phycocolloids, but they also contain compounds with potential in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmetic, chemical and energetic applications. The biorefinery concept applied to seaweed facilitates the extraction of different constituents ensuring full utilization of resources and generating few residues through a succession of steps. Seaweed biorefineries are less advanced than those based on terrestrial biomass and the design of efficient processes requires further study. This review presents practical successful examples to obtain two or more commercially valuable components from red seaweeds. The selected processes consist on cascading stages of both conventional and alternative techniques to illustrate different possible valorization strategies. Â© 2019 by the authors.

TI  - US country studies program: An example of bilateral assistance to developing countries on climate change
AB  - Under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) developing and transition countries are eventually required to report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventories and response (mitigation) options. The United States (US) and other donors are providing financial and technical support for climate change country studies to help meet their needs under the UNFCCC The US Country Studies Program (US CSP) was originally announced by President Bush at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Brazil in 1992. The Program is currently assisting 56 country studies to address climate change. There are strong components of ocean and coastal assessment, adaptation and management in 41 of the 56 studies in the US CSP. All studies in the Program are implemented under respective bilateral cooperative agreements. Technical assistance for conducting GHG inventory, climate change impact vulnerability studies, and adaptation and mitigation assessments includes training of analysts, sharing of contemporary tools and assessment techniques, implementation of information-sharing workshops, and an exchange program for analysts. Emphases have been put on strengthening of human and institutional capacity to cope with global climate change issues, hence providing developing and transition countries with a sustained basis for meeting the goals of the UNFCCC.

TI  - Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emission Assessment for Using Alternative Marine Fuels: A Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) Case Study
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set decarbonisation goals for the shipping industry. As a result, shipowners and operators are preparing to use low- or zero-carbon alternative fuels. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emission performances are fundamental for choosing suitable marine fuels. However, the current regulations adopt tank-to-wake (TTW) emission assessment methods that could misrepresent the total climate impacts of fuels. To better understand the well-to-wake (WTW) GHG emission performances, this work applied the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to a very large crude carrier (VLCC) sailing between the Middle East and China to investigate the emissions. The life cycle GHG emission impacts of using alternative fuels, including liquified natural gas (LNG), methanol, and ammonia, were evaluated and compared with using marine gas oil (MGO). The bunkering site of the VLCC was in Zhoushan port, China. The MGO and LNG were imported from overseas, while methanol and ammonia were produced in China. Four production pathways for methanol and three production pathways for ammonia were examined. The results showed that, compared with MGO, using fossil energy-based methanol and ammonia has no positive effect in terms of annual WTW GHG emissions. The emission reduction effects of fuels ranking from highest to lowest were full solar and battery-based methanol, full solar and battery-based ammonia, and LNG. Because marine ammonia-fuelled engines have not been commercialised, laboratory data were used to evaluate the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The GHG emission reduction potential of ammonia can be exploited more effectively if the N2O emitted from engines is captured and disposed of through after-treatment technologies. This paper discussed three scenarios of N2O emission abatement ratios of 30\%, 50\%, and 90\%. The resulting emission reduction effects showed that using full solar and battery-based ammonia with 90\% N2O abatement performs better than using full solar and battery-based methanol. The main innovation of this work is realising the LCA GHG emission assessment for a deep-sea ship.

TI  - Microalgae as second generation biofuel. A review
AB  - Microalgae are autotrophic microorganisms having extremely high photosynthetic efficiency and are valued as rich source of lipids, hydrocarbons, and other complex oils for biodiesel besides being an invaluable source of bioethanol, biomethane, and biohydrogen. Biodiesel produced from oilseed crops such as jatropha and soy have lower yields per unit land area and threaten food security. Indeed, microalgae have higher oil yields amounting to about 40 times more oil per unit area of land in comparison to terrestrial oilseed crops such as soy and canola. Further, microalgae production does not require arable land for cultivation. Biofuel is regarded as a proven clean energy source and several entrepreneurs are attempting to commercialize this renewable source. Technology for producing and using biofuel has been known for several years and is frequently modified and upgraded. In view of this, a review is presented on microalgae as second generation biofuel. Microalgal farming for biomass production is the biggest challenge and opportunity for the biofuel industry. These are considered to be more efficient in converting solar energy into chemical energy and are amongst the most efficient photosynthetic plants on earth. Microalgae have simple cellular structure, a lipid-rich composition, and a rapid rate of reproduction. Many microalgal strains can be grown in saltwater and other harsh conditions. Some autotrophic microalgae can also be converted to heterotrophic ones to accumulate high quality oils using organic carbon. However, there are several technical challenges that need to be addressed to make microalgal biofuel profitable. The efficiency of microalgal biomass production is highly influenced by environmental conditions, e.g., light of proper intensity and wavelength, temperature, CO2 concentration, nutrient composition, salinities and mixing conditions, and by the choice of cultivation systems: open versus closed pond systems, photobioreactors. Currently, microalgae for commercial purpose are grown mostly in open circular/elongated ``raceway{''} ponds which generally have low yields and high production costs. However, a hybrid system combining closed photobioreactor and open pond is a better option. The biggest hurdle in commercialization of microalgal biofuel is the high cost and energy requirement for the microalgal biomass production, particularly agitation, harvesting, and drying of biomass. In order to conserve energy and reduce costs, algae are often harvested in a two-step process involving flocculation followed by centrifugation, filtration, or micro-straining to get a solid concentration. However, the major bottlenecks in algal biodiesel production within the cell can be identified and handled by adopting a system approach involving transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. Research and developments in the field of new materials and advanced designs for cultivation in closed bioreactors, use of waste water for biomass production, screening of efficient strains, high-value coproduct strategy, and cutting-edge metabolic engineering are thought to provide the biggest opportunities to substantially improve the cost effectiveness of such production systems.

TI  - Refitting platforms due for decommissioning in sustainable projects
AB  - The reuse of oil platforms remains a problem that does not yet have a solution, except for either removing or completely restoring them. This is especially true for offshore rigs in the Mediterranean and generally for the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea, where only a few initiatives have been undertaken to reuse parts for the exploitation of new fields. New industrial technology and new environmental policies increase the possibility of developing other ways of decommissioning, with intrinsic social and environmental benefits. An industrial reuse of offshore equipment could involve the injection and storage of CO2, one of the main greenhouse gases, as a tool in negotiating the future trading in greenhouse gas credits. An important role in reuse could be furthered by Gas To Liquids (GTL) technology, which allows the extraction of marginal gas reserves. The continuous technological developments and improved equipment have led to ever smaller plants, which can therefore be mounted on offshore platforms. Based on this premise we have analysed two case studies, brought together in conclusion which could further future research for these kind of reuse. Last, but not least, the possibility of mounting GPS stations will be discussed, potentially on monotubular platforms, without neglecting the need for maintenance, which in this case is relevant.

TI  - Bio FT-diesel in the European maritime sector: a technical economic valuation of straw crops potential
AB  - The present study has as an objective on exploring the lignocellulosic residues from European agriculture as an energy source for the production of bio Fischer-Tropsch diesel (bio FT-diesel) as a low carbon alternative to be used in the European maritime sector, based on a techno-economic methodology of residue collection combined with the production yield of FT-Diesel available on literature. It permitted us to find a potential production of 8.5 million tons (Mton) of biofuel across 11 countries, and the reduction of 26 Mton of CO2 annually. The study contributes to the understanding that the fuel could be only cost-competitive if the crude oil reaches values between 10.45â€“16.91 /GJ. In addition, the low technology status of bio FT-diesel production and the lack of biofuel standards to the maritime sector are limitations that can only be addressed with effective regulations added to research and development from collection to production and consumption.

TI  - A feasibility study of CO2 geologic sequestration integrating reservoir simulation, rock-physics theory, and seismic modeling
AB  - CO2 capture and sequestration is a promising approach to reduce carbon emission and mitigate the greenhouse effect. We have developed a methodology combining reservoir simulation, rock-physics theory, and seismic modeling to simulate the CO2 sequestration and monitoring process, based on an idealized geologic model of the Sleipner field. First, we simulated a constant-rate CO2 injection into the idealized geologic model to study the basics of the twophase flow involved in CO2 sequestration. The main features of the CO2 plume evolution and pressure build-up are captured in the simulation results. In any CO2 sequestration project, an important part is monitoring CO2 distribution using seismic methods. The seismic response of the injected CO2 is controlled by its effect on elastic properties of the reservoir rock. We built a rock-physics model to assess the effect of CO2 on wave properties. For unconsolidated sand, a sensitivity study found that CO2 saturation and effective pressure can strongly affect wave properties. Based on the reservoir simulation results and the rock-physics model, seismic modeling is performed at different stages of the injection using the symplectic stereomodeling method. The synthetic seismograms found that the seismic responses of the reservoir are strongly affected by the saturation and pressure change induced by the injection of CO2, and the seismic response of CO2 is strong enough to be resolved from seismic data.

TI  - Effects of CO2 on the ocean environment
AB  - The most immediate environmental effect of solving CO2 in the ocean is a reduction of the pH. The present rate of change of pH in the surface mixed layer due to invasion of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere is close to 0.015 pH units per decade. A cumulative reduction of 0.1 units has already taken place during the past 200 years, and a further reduction of 0.2 to 0.3 pH units may occur in the next century. This perturbation may be compared to the existing range of pH in the world ocean of 0.5 pH units, a seasonal amplitude of up to 0.1 pH units locally, and to glacial to interglacial variations of 0.2-0.3 pH units in 10000 years (0.0003 pH units per decade). Emissions to the atmosphere expose species in almost all ocean surface waters, including high productivity zones, to permanent and uniform reduction of pH. Disposal of CO2 at fixed locations in the ocean can give strong maximum pH reduction at depth where natural variability in pH is smaller and tolerance limits for biota probably narrower.

TI  - Small projects-fertile ground for large project savings
AB  - Offshore small projects (< $ 20 MM gross) often account for 15-20 percent of Oil and Gas Company's annual capital budget. Poor small project execution increases project costs and adversely affects production. Project management skills and habits developed in small project execution, good or bad, feed large project performance. Using small projects as a training ground for large projects improves small project efficiency and develops project professionals with skills to save hundreds of millions of dollars on a large capital projects program. The small project arena provides a dependable and renewable source of project management professionals at a time when age demographics threaten long term project performance. The following paper describes a small project improvement initiative implemented to improve small project performance. The initiative focused on: 1) evaluating current performance 2) developing common processes and tools and 3) establishing a global small project network to share best practices and facilitate global interaction.

TI  - A cost saving design for pile to structure connections as applied to BP magnus
AB  - BP Magnus is the largest self-floating steel tower yet designed. It is currently being fabricated, and when installed in 1982 will stand in 610ft of water. In order to effect substantial savings on the float-out weight and fabrication costs and to simplify offshore installation, a new approach has been used for the design of the critical grouted connection between the structure and its piled foundation. Using published results of full scale and model tests of static axially loaded grouted connections, a pile sleeve to pile conection was designed to be substantially shorter than previous design practice. A detailed test programme was formulated involving scale models and near full size specimens. The test programme included testing at simulated maximum storm load and cyclic loading. Key test results are presented and correlate well with previously published results justifying a more economical approach to the design of this type of connection. The test results have demonstrated that the design has a more than adequate factor of safety in relation to the design load. The implication for the project, which is designed to use single piece 84" diameter driven piles, has been to reduce the overall lengths of the piles and pile sleeves thus saving between 6 and 10% of the total fabricated weight. In addition, given the limitation on the length of piles that may be handled offshore, a reduction in grouted length allows greater pile penetration and therefore greater axial capacity. This has reduced the number of piles which might otherwise have been required to support the Magnus structure and consequently a saving in offshore time.

TI  - The extent and magnitude of sediment contamination in the Southern California Bight
AB  - More than 30 million dollars are expended annually to assess environmental quality of the Southern California Bight, yet only 5\% of the Bight area is surveyed on an ongoing basis. Because decision makers lacked the data to make regional assessments of ecosystem condition, multiple stakeholders collaborated to create a Southern California Bight Regional Monitoring Program. The third survey in this program was conducted in 2003. A primary goal of this regional monitoring program was to determine the extent and magnitude of sediment contamination in the Southern California Bight, and to compare these assessments among several different habitats. A stratified random design was selected to provide unbiased areal assessments of environmental condition; 359 surficial sediments were collected, representing 12 different habitats that extend from shallow embayments and estuaries to deep offshore basins. Each sample was analyzed for grain size, total organic carbon and nitrogen, 15 trace metals, and a suite of persistent organic constituents (total dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane {[}DDT], total polychlorinated biphenyl {[}PCB], and total polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon {[}PAH]). The greatest accumulated mass of these constituents (76\% on average; range 70\% to 87\%) was located at depths >200 m, which was proportional to its relatively large area (67\% of entire Southern California Bight). The greatest sediment concentrations of trace metals, total PAH, and total PCB were observed in embayments (e. g., marinas, estuaries draining urbanized watersheds, and industrialized port facilities). These shallow habitats also contained a disproportionately high mass of contaminants relative to their area. Despite the relatively widespread anthropogenic enrichment of Southern California Bight sediments, only 1\% of the Southern California Bight was at a moderate to high risk of adverse biological effects based on empirically derived sediment quality guidelines. Risk, however, was not evenly distributed throughout the Southern California Bight. The greatest risk of adverse biological effects was found in sediments of marinas, Los Angeles estuaries, and large publicly owned treatment works (POTWs); these were the only habitats for which the mean effects range-median quotient exceeded 0.5. The least risk was observed in sediments associated with the Channel Islands and small POTWs, for which all sites were considered to be at low risk of adverse biological effects.

With equivalent formation pressure gradients of 13ppg, H2S levels of 140ppm and formations with potential for massive losses, but also very high gas productivity, severe challenges were presented to the drilling engineering and operations teams and to the logistical infrastructure; these challenges were successfully overcome, ensuring that the wells were delivered safely using the planned Tender Assisted Drilling Rig. Maintaining well control integrity throughout all drilling and completion operations is always crucial to ensuring safe well delivery. In wells with total losses, drilled through highly productive carbonate formations, there is a high risk that any loss of the primary drilling fluid barrier may result in the well flipping out to gas very rapidly. This risk is highest during trips out of the hole, when the Rotating Control Device (RCD) pressure seal must be removed to retrieve the drilling BHA and run the lower completion. For wells with total losses, options to control the well during trips have traditionally involved a combination of methods including setting gunk plugs, setting composite bridge plugs, or using a preinstalled Downhole Isolation Valve. The purpose of this paper is to present a fourth option, the top-kill method using a dual-density fluid system. During the 2015-2016 PETRONAS development drilling campaign, following thorough risk assessments and detailed planning and logistical evaluation, this method was proven to be a reliable and safe means of controlling the well during trips. A total of five (5) wells were drilled from the development platform, using a surface BOP stack and an RCD. Top kill operations were engineered by pumping two types of fluid into the annulus at surface; a slightly underbalanced Light Annular Mud and a heavier density Kill Mud. By combining these fluids, the well was put into an engineered overbalanced state, with the loss rate controlled via a pre-determined pumping rate. Once the RCD seal element was re-installed, the well reverted back to pumping Light Annular Mud into the annulus as per normal PMCD procedures. This paper highlights the meticulous planning, execution, training and continuous learning that was evident in these challenging operations. This paper also discusses critical HSE concerns and makes recommendations for future PMCD projects. Â© 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Mapping of CO2 storage possibilities on the Norwegian continental shelf
AB  - The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) has mapped and evaluated possible storage sites on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). The evaluation is published in three CO2 Storage Atlases: Norwegian part of the North Sea (2011), the Norwegian Sea (2013) and the Barents Sea (2013) (Halland et al.). The study is based on detailed work on all relevant geological formations and hydrocarbon fields on the NCS. In total 27 geological formations have been individually assessed and grouped into saline aquifers. In addition, several mapped and dry-drilled structures and abandoned hydrocarbon fields have been evaluated. The largest storage capacities are mapped in the mature part of the North Sea, where several saline aquifers and basins are evaluated. Compared with the areas in the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea, the Barents Sea areas is an immature petroleum province, with high exploration activity.

TI  - The â€˜perfectâ€™ conversion: Dramatic increase in co2 efflux from shellfish ponds and mangrove conversion in china
AB  - Aquaculture, particularly shellfish ponds, has expanded dramatically and become a major cause of mangrove deforestation and â€œblue carbonâ€ loss in China. We present the first study to examine CO2 efflux from marine aquaculture/shellfish ponds and in relation to land-use change from mangrove forests in China. Light and dark sediment CO2 efflux from shellfish ponds averaged at 0.61 Â± 0.07 and 0.90 Â± 0.12 kg CO2 mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1 (= 37.67 Â± 4.89 and 56.0 Â± 6.13 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1), respectively. The corresponding rates (âˆ’4.21 Â± 4.54 and 41.01 Â± 4.15 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1) from the adjacent mangrove forests that were devoid of aquaculture wastewater were lower, while those from the adjacent mangrove forests (3.48 Â± 7.83 and 73.02 Â± 5.76 mmol mâˆ’2 dâˆ’1)) receiving aquaculture wastewater markedly increased. These effluxes are significantly higher than those reported for mangrove forests to date, which is attributable to the high nutrient levels and the physical disturbance of the substrate associated with the aquaculture operation. A rise of 1 Â°C in the sediment temperature resulted in a 6.56% rise in CO2 released from the shellfish ponds. Combined with pond area data, the total CO2 released from shellfish ponds in 2019 was estimated to be ~12 times that in 1983. The total annual CO2 emission from shellfish ponds associated with mangrove conversion reached 2-5 Tg, offsetting the C storage by mangrove forests in China. These are significant environmental consequences rather than just a simple shift of land use. Around 30% higher CO2 emissions are expected from aquaculture ponds (including shellfish ponds) compared to shellfish ponds alone. Total annual CO2 emission from shellfish ponds will likely decrease to the level reported in early 1980 under the pond area-shrinking scenario, but it will be more than doubled under the business-as-usual scenario projected for 2050. This study highlights the necessity of curbing the expansion of aquaculture ponds in valuable coastal wetlands and increasing mangrove restoration to abandoned ponds. Â© 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Trends of digital and intelligent technology development in the shipping industry
AB  - Present day ships incorporate different degrees of automated systems and the tendency is to increase the degree of â€œintelligenceâ€, eventually leading to autonomous ships at least for some specific operations. This presentation discusses the important aspects of energy transition, of automation and of digitalization that the maritime transportation sector is facing. The pressures of transition to carbon free environment leads to pressures for improving the energy efficiency of ship operation and to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. This will be achieved by improved technologies and alternative forms as will be presented. The evolution of automation is also discussed as well as the impacts and the problems related with the digitalization in the shipping industry. Â© 2023 the Author(s).

TI  - Alkalinity in Tidal Tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay
AB  - Despite the important role of alkalinity in estuarine carbon cycling, the seasonal and decadal variability of alkalinity, particularly within multiple tidal tributaries of the same estuary, is poorly understood. Here we analyze more than 25,000 alkalinity measurements, mostly from the 1980s and 1990s, in the major tidal tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay, a large, coastal-plain estuary of eastern North America. The long-term means of alkalinity in tidal-fresh waters vary by a factor of 6 among seven tidal tributaries, reflecting the alkalinity of nontidal rivers draining to these estuaries. At 25 stations, mostly in the Potomac River Estuary, we find significant long-term increasing trends that exceed the trends in the nontidal rivers upstream of those stations. Box model calculations in the Potomac River Estuary indicate that the main cause of the estuarine trends is a declining alkalinity sink. The magnitude of this sink is consistent with a simple model of calcification by the invasive bivalve Corbicula fluminea. More generally, in tidal tributaries fed by high-alkalinity nontidal rivers, alkalinity is consumed, with sinks ranging from 8% to 27% of the upstream input. In contrast, tidal tributaries that are fed by low-alkalinity nontidal rivers have sources of alkalinity amounting to 34% to 171% of the upstream input. For a single estuarine system, the Chesapeake Bay has diverse alkalinity dynamics and can thus serve as a laboratory for studying the numerous processes influencing alkalinity among the world's estuaries.

TI  - Floating offshore windfarm integrated in the subsea field development-saipem windstream concept, applied to a case study
AB  - Oil and Gas Operators are moving active production and injection equipment onto the seabed with the aim of reducing CAPEX and/or topside space requirements. Moreover, they want to minimize new production floating facilities (e.g. through tie-back to existing FPSO/Floaters). Given this scenario, the overall electric power needs may become an issue because of the extra power demand due to the increasing number of electric consumers placed subsea. These electric loads may include the subsea boosting (pumps or compressors) operations, pipeline heating or the typical subsea water, chemical injection and valves actuation (in the case of all electric control systems), just to mention some of potential subsea power consumers, and may exceed the existing FPSO/Floater power production capacity. A potential solution to overcome this issue consists of the deployment of wind generators combined with topside Island power generation. Offshore wind power is indeed more and more considered for shore power supply, but also by the Oil and Gas industry with the objective of reducing the carbon footprint of their facilities. High power marine wind generators are already consolidated technologies for near coast, and today they are evolving in the short-term to floating solutions for the open sea. Saipem has developed its own floating wind turbine solution, called Hexafloat, consisting in a pendular floating foundation made of tubular elements and connected through tendons to a counterweight. This solution is particularly cost-competitive for deepwater locations (thanks to the low mooring costs) even for harsh environmental conditions (thanks to an excellent stability), and will unlock the possibility to deploy large wind power generators far from the coastline in deep water. The system composed by the Hexafloat base and the wind generator may be equipped with onboard backup generation utilities to provide continuous power supply for subsea, despite wind intermittency, and to provide support to certain subsea field development services, making the assembly a kind of supporting device for the subsea field or for the FPSO. This is the Windstream concept that is under internal development and that will be better described in the present paper through the explanation of the results achieved within a couple of case-studies analyzed.

TI  - Case studies and cost savings associated with fit-for-purpose abandonment systems
AB  - The development of innovative technologies and the effective application of late-stage intervention and abandonment systems in the oil and gas industry have resulted in cost savings and an increased standard of safety. This paper examines the successes of fit-for-purpose systems specifically designed for operations on load bearing offshore platform projects in an efficient manner. To effectively address the market, a new system for completing interventions and abandonment operations was needed. Subsequently, a system was designed which incorporates capabilities associated with Jack Up rigs along with the quick mobilization and set up of a crane assisted rigless unit. This solution has been utilized in offshore campaigns that include all phases of abandonment operations including well diagnostics, reservoir isolation, tubular retrieval, fishing and section milling. This paper will review the capabilities of the system along with case studies which highlight the versatility and adaptability of the system which provides an integrated solution package to the client. The system which includes a Pulling and Jacking unit also incorporates all ancillary equipment necessary to proficiently intervene and permanently abandon offshore wells. These case studies will discuss the planned parameters, examine the operations, and review the lessons learned from the projects. Copyright 2016, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - State-of-the-art development of offshore water deaeration processesutilizing high-purity nitrogen for chemical free oxygen removal
AB  - Conventional deaeration of seawater for water injection use expensive chemical scavengers and heavyvacuum towers, which occupy valuable space on offshore installations. The scope of this study is toinvestigate, compare, and further advance the development of two state-of-the-art deaeration technologieswhich solve the aforementioned issues. The first method, compressorless deaeration with the use of strippinggas is a newly developed modification of an already efficient, light, compact, and worldwide implementedtechnology. This technology uses pure nitrogen in a regeneration loop, together with static mixers whichallow oxygen mass-transfer from seawater into the gas phase. The second method utilize the same provennitrogen regeneration loop in combination with novel membrane deaeration technology. Advanced dynamic process simulations, combined with field data, mechanical design and processcalculations are utilized to quantify process parameters and design requirements for the two technologies.The results are presented and used for discussing advantages, disadvantages, possibilities and furtherdevelopment needs of both the stripping gas- A nd membrane technology. Results show that it is possible to further increase the robustness of the stripping gas-technology byeliminating the compressor. A clever ejector system with turn-down capabilities ensures the technology'sadvantage of positive operating pressure and utilizes energy from the seawater flow to compress thenitrogen. Power calculations, turn-down possibilities and oxygen removal efficiency at various operatingconditions are presented. A suggested design for membrane deaeration is also presented, along withcalculations and comparisons to the stripping gas technology, especially regarding flow rate capacity andthe economies of scale. The main advantage of the proposed membrane technique compared to existingmembrane concepts is the high-purity nitrogen regeneration loop, which offers improved mass-transfercapabilities across the membrane. The novelty of this work the feasibility of successfully operating a compressor-less, efficient, compactdeaeration system on positive pressure. Additionally, the stripping gas technology requires no chemicalscavengers in order to obtain an oxygen concentration lower than 10 ppb. The membrane deaeration processcan also achieve low oxygen concentrations without chemical scavengers and it is further found that thetechnology might be economically viable compared to stripping gas for low flow rates.

TI  - Imaging the Aquistore reservoir after 36 kilotonnes of CO2 injection using distributed acoustic sensing
AB  - Aquistore is a geologic CO2 storage project that is using a deep saline formation as a storage reservoir. From April 2015 to February 2016, approximately 36 kilotonnes of CO2 were injected into the reservoir at a depth of 3130-3350 m. We have developed an analysis of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) 3D vertical seismic profiling data acquired in February 2016, marking the first seismic survey since injection began. The VSP data were processed in parallel with baseline preinjection data from a November 2013 survey, with the objective of detecting and characterizing the subsurface CO2 plume and evaluating the repeatability of DAS in a reservoir monitoring project. A single processing sequence was devised that (1) accurately imaged the reservoir for the baseline and monitor data and (2) attained adequate repeatability to observe time-lapse differences related to the presence of CO2. Repeatability was somewhat compromised by the less advanced noise cancellation methodology of the DAS system used for the baseline survey. In the final cross-equalized migrated data volumes, normalized root-mean-square (nrms) difference values of < 0.4 were attained at the reservoir level indicating good repeatability compared with most surface seismic studies. An injection-related amplitude anomaly with maximum nrms values of approximately 0.7 is apparent in the Deadwood Formation of the reservoir, whereas no significant nrms anomalies were observed near the injection and monitoring wells in the Black Island Member or above the reservoir.

TI  - Rapid carbon accumulation following managed realignment on the Bay of Fundy
AB  - Salt marshes are highly effective carbon (C) sinks and have higher rates of soil C burial (per square meter) than terrestrial ecosystems. Marsh reclamation and anthropogenic impacts, however, have resulted in extensive losses of salt marshes. Restoration of marshes drained and â€œreclaimedâ€ for agriculture (referred to in Canada as dykelands) and degraded marshes can generate C credits, but only if C burial is reliably quantified. To date, studies reporting on C burial rates have been limited primarily to restored marshes which are more than 10 years old. Here we report on a study which assessed C burial six years after the return of tidal flooding to a section of dykeland in Aulac, New Brunswick on Canadaâ€™s Bay of Fundy. The C burial rate in the restored marsh averaged 1 329 g C m-2 yr-1, more than five times the rate reported for a nearby mature marsh. Carbon density in the recovering marsh was relatively consistent with depth and although salt marsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) became established in 2012, the bulk of the C in the new marsh deposit is assumed to be allochthonous. Financial constraints are a barrier to marsh restoration projects and C markets could provide a considerable source of funding for restoration work in the future. For marsh restoration projects to be recognized in C crediting systems, however, it must also be demonstrated that the allochthonous C would not otherwise have been sequestered; the potential for this is discussed.

TI  - Application of distributed fiber optics sensing technology for real-time gas kick detection
AB  - Effective well control depends on the drilling teams' knowledge of wellbore flow dynamics and their ability to predict and control influx. Detection of a gas influx in an offshore environment is particularly challenging, and there are no existing datasets that have been verified and validated for gas kick migration at full scale annulus conditions. This study bridges this gap with the newly instrumented experimental well at PERTT (Petroleum Engineering Research & Technology Transfer Lab) at Louisiana State University (LSU) simulating an offshore marine riser environment with its larger than average annular space and mud circulation capability. The experimental setup instrumented with fiber optics and pressure/temperature gauges provides a physical model of the dynamic gas migration over large distances in full scale annular conditions. Current kick detection methods do not always reliably detect a gas influx and have not kept pace with the increasingly challenging offshore drilling conditions. Even though there have been some recent developments in offshore kick detection, all methods thus far are only qualitative in nature because they are based on measurements at the surface. This study addresses current kick detection limitations and illuminates the potential for implementing distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS) to the marine riser as a non-invasive and effective kick detection method in both stagnant and circulating annular conditions. As North America's only academic full scale well testing center, an experimental well in the PERTT lab was utilized to monitor and characterize gas rise using DFOS to simulate well control scenarios in offshore drilling riser environments. DFOS allows for the tracking of the gas migration in both the stagnant and full-scale circulating annulus conditions. Data from pressure sensors is integrated with the distributed temperature (DTS) and acoustic (DAS) measurements, for real-time downhole monitoring of the dynamics of the gas migration and fluid front movement. By implementing time and frequency domain analysis of the fiber optic data, we show that the gas rise and water front movement can be identified. Both the water and gas injection down the tubing independently show characteristic fronts in the DTS and DAS data, which gives us confidence in our interpretation. Once the gas is present in the annulus, the DAS measurements indicate a higher than expected gas-rise velocity, and this is most probably due to the full-scale annular geometry and circulating conditions enabling a faster gas rise velocity compared to previous work in this area consisting only of small-scale experiments and experiments through tubing. The two-phase flow experiments conducted in this research provide critical insights for understanding the flow dynamics in offshore drilling riser conditions, and the results provide an indication of how quickly gas can migrate in a marine riser scenario warranting further investigation for the sake of effective well control.

TI  - Alternative solutions for marine fuel's composition towards Marine Strategy Directive performance
AB  - In April 2018, the IMO adopted an ambitious GHG emissions reduction strategy for shipping. It will shape the future fleet decarbonisation pathway and helps to choose alternative fuels and technologies. Methanol as marine fuel leads to drastically reducing sulphur and PM compared to conventional marine fuel. Meanwhile, biodiesel, as sustainable energy source, is characterized by high cetane index, low toxicity, and good biodegradation. Methanol-biodiesel-diesel blends require only limited modification to engines and fuel systems. For this reason, methanol and biodiesel may be well suited partly substitute oil-based fuels in the existing ship fleet. In order to replace the larger portion of fossil compound in marine fuel by components from renewable sources, it is necessary to develop multi-component blends. However, an increase in the proportion of components in a blend could be critical for the final properties of the blend and requires detailed research. The physical-chemical properties of the methanol (up to 30 %), biodiesel (up to 10 %) and diesel components as well as their mixtures have been analysed. It has been found that considering to ISO 8217:2012 standard and environmental requirements a blend with 10 % methanol and 10 % biodiesel is the most suitable alternative for marine applications.

TI  - Novel technology to achieve the fastest and cleanest formation sample data: An introduction to focused sampling probe methodology
AB  - This paper presents a technology designed to obtain the most representative formation samples in minimum time with less contamination. An innovative formation testing technology using the new focused sampling probe and real-time downhole fluid identification service, which enables users to save time and expense by eliminating the need for long pump outs and a second run, particularly in deepwater wells with unconsolidated sand reservoir formations. Representative formation sampling requires minimal differential pressure to move fluid and is uniquely able to provide low-contamination samples in extremely difficult unconsolidated formations. The in-situ fluid ID sensor data, which included fluid density, capacitance, resistivity, pressure, and temperature information, was used in conjunction with contamination forecasting software to provide accurate fluid-contamination predictions. The formation testing tool focused sampling probe delivers a purer fluid sample than the traditional sampling techniques with less pumping time. This decreases uncertainty in terms of establishing connectivity and flow assurance while increasing operational efficiency. The formation sampling service incorporates oval pad geometry with large surface area, resulting in lower forces acting on the formation sandface and reduced sanding. Fluid flow is segmented into an inner and outer flow section; fluids in the outer section will be more contaminated and will be discarded back to the borehole. Fluids in the inner section will be purer and very low contamination is achieved much faster compared to traditional pumpout. In some cases, contamination is too low to be measured. The large flow area of the oval focused pad results in higher flow rate than a circular probe. The fast and versatile pump in the formation sampling service enables reduced cleanup times.

TI  - Primary producers sustaining macro-invertebrate communities in intertidal mangrove forests
AB  - In contrast to the large number of studies on the trophic significance of mangrove primary production to the aquatic foodweb, there have been few attempts to provide an overview of the relative importance of different primary carbon sources to invertebrates in the intertidal mangrove habitats. We determined carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C, delta(15)N) in sediments, primary producers, and invertebrate species from an intertidal mangrove forest located along the southeast coast of India in order to determine the contribution of mangrove leaf litter and other carbon sources to the invertebrate community. Organic matter in sediments under the mangrove vegetation was characterized by relatively high delta(13)C values and low C:N ratios, indicating that mangrove-derived organic matter was not the principal source and that imported phytodetritus from the mangrove creeks and adjacent bay significantly contributed to the sediment organic matter pool. Invertebrates were found to display a wide range of delta(13)C values, most being 3-11parts per thousand enriched relative to the average mangrove leaf signal. The pulmonate gastropod Onchidium sp. showed unusually low delta(15)N values (-5.6+/-0.9parts per thousand), but further work is needed to adequately explain these data. A compilation of stable isotope data from various sources indicates that significant assimilation of mangrove-derived carbon is only detectable in a limited number of species, and suggests that local and imported algal sources are a major source of carbon for benthic invertebrate communities in intertidal mangrove forests. These results provide new insights into carbon utilization patterns in vegetated tropical intertidal habitats and show a striking similarity with results from temperate salt marsh ecosystems where local plant production has often been found to contribute little to intertidal foodwebs.

TI  - DEVELOPMENT OF DUAL-LIFTING TECHNIQUE FOR INSTALLATION OF TOPSIDE MEGA-MODULES
AB  - As many deep-sea oil and gas fields are being developed, floating platforms becomes larger with more complicated topsides. However, the construction time is demanded to be shorter to meet the overall project schedule. The use of very large topside modules is one of the effective ways to reduce the integration time and decrease the possibility of fabrication defects. The Ichthys Project's CPF(Central Process Facility) is currently being constructed at Samsung Heavy Industries(SHI). The CPF will be the world's largest production semi submersible platform. The hull is constructed on the Offshore Floating Dock and most of the topside modules are prepared at workshops and integrated by floating cranes on the hull. To maximize production efficiency in terms of reduced integration time and reworks, several topside modules are assembled into a larger module weighing up to 7,400 tonne spanning 150m long. Such large module cannot be handled by a single 8,000 tonne F/C, the largest crane that SHI owns. This fact initiated the idea of dual-lifting with a combination of the two F/Cs (8,000 tonne and 3,600 tonne) which enables lifting, transportation and integration of the mega-modules properly and safely without building a larger capacity F/C. Using different sized F/Cs increases the flexibility of the operation of the F/Cs. To ensure safety during the dual-lifting, the two F/Cs are synchronized to be controlled as a single crane unit. During hoisting, all the measured data such as loads and positions of the hooks, and rotation of the module, are monitored in real time basis and used to hoist the module automatically. All the systems are designed to be redundant. Additional engineering works are performed to check the safety such as 1) structural analysis to investigate the structural safety with out-of-phased motions at boom-tip 2) time-domain analysis and 3) model test in ocean basin with the operation scenarios in real environments to obtain the dynamic load factors and the guidance on the operation limits in terms of wave heights. The two crane barges are moored side-by-side using fenders and mooring lines, and tug operation conditions are planned not only to move but also to push the two barges from sideways to be moored tightly, which minimizes the possibility of relative motions between the two barges. The developed system had been applied to the integration of all the modules successfully weighing from 4600 to 7400 tonne. It is expected to be applied to many other offshore projects to keep the construction schedule on time. This paper will address and share the technical experiences obtained during the dual lifting of the mega-modules for the Ichthys Project's CPF.

TI  - Machinery matters: Contra-rotating propellers for diesel electric ships
AB  - WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤ and Japan's IHI Marine United Inc (IHIMU) have concluded a cooperation agreement under which the contra-rotating propeller (CRP) systems developed by IHIMU will be incorporated into WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤'s propulsion solutions used on board diesel-electric driven ships. The cooperation agreement mainly covers the European market, where the environmental demands on shipping operations are becoming increasingly stringent. The HIMU CRP system will achieve 10% better propulsion efficiency compared to conventional diesel-electric propulsion systems, and is applicable to all vessels from small ships to large LNG carriers. This efficiency improvement translates into significant fuel savings, thus enabling a short return on investment as well as reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The application of the CRP system could be extended to include hybrid (mechanical driven and electric driven) propulsion systems, and four-stroke mechanical systems, at a future stage.

TI  - The giant serpent Ormen Lange, managing the new key provider of natural gas to Europe from beneath the deep waters of the Norwegian Sea
AB  - Ormen Lange is the name of the second-largest Norwegian gas field and was discovered and identified by Hydro in 1997. The Ormen Lange field comprises four key project features: The offshore subsea solution, approximately 100 km off the northwest coast of Norway, with templates, manifolds and pipelines; the onshore process and gas export facilities at Nyhamna, on the coast of More and Romsdal County; the gas export transportation system between Norway and the UK, through a tie-in to the Sleipner field installation as a distribution connector; and the Easington gas reception terminal in the UK. The Ormen Lange field development project is of vital importance, not only to its owners, but also to Norway - making the country the third-biggest exporter of natural gas worldwide. On December 4, 2003, a plan for development and operation (PDO) was submitted to the Norwegian authorities, to embark on the project's execution phase. The project has been subjected to extraordinary, and in particular technical and commercial challenges which have required the development of and a focus on new management systems and systematic work processes. This paper provides an introduction to the elements that collectively represent the entire Ormen Lange field development, including the key technical and commercial challenges, as well as the management strategy, utilizing systematic work processes to achieve alignment and efficient progress while preserving the environment, personal health and assets.

This leads to increased production costs associated with frequent workovers to remove fill, replacement of downhole equipment, and surface-equipment overhauls. In addition, production rates are often decreased to minimize solids production and can also compromise ultimate reservoir recovery. Conventional resin-consolidation systems have been successful in preventing solids production in short, homogenous intervals. However, resin consolidation in longer intervals has resulted in erratic success because of the lack of complete and uniform treatment of the entire interval length. Any untreated length of interval has the propensity to produce solids, resulting in a failed treatment. This paper presents the results of laboratory development and field testing of a new water-based resin-consolidation system applicable for proppant flowback and sand consolidation as well as field trials for proppant-flowback applications. This new system benefits from effective and efficient treatment of significantly longer intervals and improved health, safety, security, and environmental compatibility (HSSE) compared to conventional consolidation systems.

TI  - Shipping Enterprise Develop Strategies Based on Low-Carbon Integrated Logistics
AB  - With increasingly fierce competition, it is a trend for shipping enterprise to provide the integrated logistics service rather than just ocean transportation. Meanwhile, the hot topics of global warming, environment pollution, energy prices rise, and low carbon economy are taken more and more seriously, hence Chinese shipping industry faces a series of challenges. This paper constructs a developmental pattern of shipping enterprises based on low-carbon integrated logistics, calculates the carbon emission of the main low-carbon integrated logistics service activities and then concludes the major carbon emission influencing factors of shipping enterprise implementing low-carbon integrated logistics, offers several suggestions for implementing low-carbon integrated logistics strategy in the aspect of technology, operation, management and market. This research enriches the academic theories on low-carbon integrated logistics and provides a certain amount of inspiration and references for the shipping enterprises.

TI  - Risk assessment of new added facility at an offshore gathering/processing plant
AB  - A Risk Assessment exercise was carried out on a new High Pressure Fuel Gas Compressor system in order to identify, prior to start up and commissioning, the potential hazards that might be induced on the running plant. As designed, the system is intended to take medium pressure Fuel Gas at 300 psig and compress it through a single stage compressor to 600 psig. HP Fuel Gas is then distributed via a Buffer tank to two Turbo Generators and one High Pressure Sea Water Injection Pump Turbine. After collecting up-to-date reference information that identifies the various equipment functions in the package, the system boundaries were defined with respect to their interface with the rest of the plant. Using the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis technique, a system review was performed and results systematically recorded on appropriate formats, to reduce the possibility of omissions and enhance the completeness of the analysis. The new HP Fuel Gas Compressor unit start up and operation should take place once all deficiencies, with an identified high Risk Priority Code, are rectified.

TI  - Carbon Dioxide Emission Pathways Avoiding Dangerous Ocean Impacts
AB  - Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases could lead to undesirable effects on oceans in coming centuries. Drawing on recommendations published by the German Advisory Council on Global Change, levels of unacceptable global marine change (so-called guardrails) are defined in terms of global mean temperature, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. A global-mean climate model {[}the Aggregated Carbon Cycle, Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model (ACC2)] is coupled with an economic module {[}taken from the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy Model (DICE)] to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to derive CO2 emission pathways that both minimize abatement costs and are compatible with these guardrails. Additionally, the ``tolerable windows approach{''} is used to calculate a range of CO2 emissions paths that obey the guardrails as well as a restriction on mitigation rate. Prospects of meeting the global mean temperature change guardrail (2 degrees and 0.2 degrees C decade(-1) relative to preindustrial) depend strongly on assumed values for climate sensitivity: at climate sensitivities >3 degrees C the guardrail cannot be attained under any CO2 emissions reduction strategy without mitigation of non-CO2 greenhouse gases. The ocean acidification guardrail (0.2 unit pH decline relative to preindustrial) is less restrictive than the absolute temperature guardrail at climate sensitivities >2.5 degrees C but becomes more constraining at lower climate sensitivities. The sea level rise and rate of rise guardrails (1 m and 5 cm decade(-1)) are substantially less stringent for ice sheet sensitivities derived in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report, but they may already be committed to violation if ice sheet sensitivities consistent with semiempirical sea level rise projections are assumed.

TI  - Standardization of North Sea multiplexed control systems for diver-assisted developments
AB  - The commitment of North Sea operators to employ extensive diver intervention in the deployment, retrieval and maintenance of subsea production systems has enabled a form of standardization for the supporting multiplexed control systems. This standardization has resulted in control system equipment becoming modularized to achieve overall cost and schedule effective approaches to small field developments. This paper presents a description of the elements which constitute the modern day Electro/Hydraulic multiplexed control system, with particular emphasis on how standardization using the modular approach has been implemented. Specific examples of standardized equipment developed using this approach are given for several recent North Sea projects. Â© 1988 Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Comparing carbon accumulation in restored and natural wetland soils of coastal Louisiana
AB  - Louisiana's chronic wetland deterioration has resulted in massive soil organic matter loss and subsequent carbon release through oxidation. To combat these losses, and reestablish ecosystem function, goods, and services, many restoration projects have been constructed or planned throughout coastal Louisiana. There are significant data gaps and conflicting results regarding wetland contributions to global warming, especially related to carbon sequestration in restored wetlands. An exceptionally large data set was used to derive carbon accumulation rates from key soil characteristics and processes. Assessments and comparisons of bulk density, organic matter, total carbon, vertical accretion (short- and longer-term), and carbon accumulation rates were made across time (chronosequence) and space (i.e., coastwide, watershed basins, and vegetation zones). Carbon accumulation rates in the Louisiana coastal zone were generally correlated to hydrogeomorphology, with higher rates occurring in zones of high river connectivity or in swamp or higher salinity tolerant marsh. On average, naturally occurring wetlands had higher carbon accumulation rates than restoration sites. Although some restoration measures were higher, and most showed increasing carbon accumulation rates over time. Results demonstrate that although wetland restoration provides many ecosystem benefits, the associated carbon sequestration may also provide useful measures for climate change management.

TI  - Evaluation of leakage potential from a carbon dioxide EOR/sequestration project
AB  - Carbon dioxide sequestration in geologic media is being investigated as a means of reducing emissions to the atmosphere. Oil and gas fields, which were in production decline, have been raised to new production levels by CO2 enhanced recovery. Currently, these fields use nearby geologic sources of CO2. Future enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects are likely to include some industrial CO2, deriving substantial economic benefit over CO2 disposal in deep aquifers. The formation overpressuring required for substantial rates of CO2 injection may drive buoyant gases upward. Although CO2 is likely to be a supercritical fluid, CH4 will remain gaseous and, as such, is much more mobile. If CH4 is driven toward the surface, it represents a potential hazard to shallow water wells and basements. This research presents a protocol for baseline surface geochemical measurements to evaluate the potential risk. The objective is to detect a subtle signal from depth in the presence of a large amount of near surface noise. Carbon dioxide and CH4 soil gas concentrations and exchange with the atmosphere (flux) measurements are necessary. Stable and radiogenic carbon isotopic measurements are required to differentiate the sources of these gases. Examples of these measurements from a CO2 enhanced EOR project at Rangely, Colorado, USA, are presented. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monitoring the power quality in a Naval Power Systems
AB  - The paper presents the results of an experimental study on power quality in an offshore drilling regime. In the platform analyzed there are many electric receivers with different characteristics which determine the power bar 600 V, a complex system with significant voltage variations (flicker effect), and a distorting regime and an important variable reactive power. To propose a viable technoeconomic solution, it was necessary data collection of samples in a series of characteristic points of the power grid NPS (Naval Power Systems). The data obtained by measurements are considered representative, but they did not surprise the intervals of maximum request of the generators (the main drive engine was not fully loaded during the measurement).

TI  - Anthropogenic-estuarine interactions cause disproportionate greenhouse gas production: A review of the evidence base
AB  - Biologically productive regions such as estuaries and coastal areas, even though they only cover a small percentage of the world's oceans, contribute significantly to methane and nitrous oxide emissions. This paper synthesises greenhouse gas data measured in UK estuary studies, highlighting that urban wastewater loading is significantly correlated with both methane (P < 0.001) and nitrous oxide (P < 0.005) concentrations. It demonstrates that specific estuary typologies render them more sensitive to anthropogenic influences on greenhouse gas production, particularly estuaries that experience low oxygen levels due to reduced mixing and stratification or high sediment oxygen demand. Significantly, we find that estuaries with high urban wastewater loading may be hidden sources of greenhouse gases globally. Synthesising available information, a conceptual model for greenhouse gas concentrations in estuaries with different morphologies and mixing regimes is presented. Applications of this model should help identification of estuaries susceptible to anthropogenic impacts and potential hotspots for greenhouse gas emissions. Â© 2021

TI  - Chemical properties of waste mangrove bark and its potential uses
AB  - During harvesting of mangroves, biomass waste such as mangrove barks are left unused. The study aims to valorize this waste by determining its chemical properties. Mangrove barks from the Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata, Bruguiera gymnorhiza, Bruguiera parviflora and Ceriops tagal were studied through Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and proximate, calorific, phenolic \& tannin contents analysis. Bruguiera gymnorhiza has the highest calorific value and carbon content of all five varieties of bark, which can substitute as material for fuel and can be planted in deforested areas for it can absorb the most CO2. On the other hand, Rhizophora apiculata and Rhizophora mucronata have the highest ash content in all mangrove barks, which can be a good source of minerals for the soil. Ceriops tagal has the highest lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, phenolic and tannin contents, which can be used as a fuel substitute and raw material source for biomass and bio-active compounds.

TI  - Global controls on carbon storage in mangrove soils
AB  - Global-scale variation in mangrove ecosystem properties has been explained using a conceptual framework linking geomorphological processes to distinct coastal environmental settings (CES) for nearly 50 years. However, these assumptions have not been empirically tested at the global scale. Here, we show that CES account for global variability in mangrove soil C:N:P stoichiometry and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Using this ecogeomorphology framework, we developed a global model that captures variation in mangrove SOC stocks compatible with distinct CES. We show that mangrove SOC stocks have been underestimated by up to 50\% (a difference of roughly 200 Mg ha(-1)) in carbonate settings and overestimated by up to 86\% (around 400 Mg ha(-1)) in deltaic coastlines. Moreover, we provide information for 57 nations that currently lack SOC data, enabling these and other countries to develop or evaluate their blue carbon inventories.

TI  - Drilling operations planning and drill deck strengthening for extended-reach wells from an existing platform
AB  - With the ever increasing need to maximize the efficiency of capital spending dollars, the use of extended reach wells to explore and/or develop previously unreachable acreage from existing platforms has become a more attractive and feasible option. These types of wells can eliminate the need for platforms or difficult subsea completions. Besides challenging drilling operations problems, increased loads must be examined and compared to original platform design requirements so modifications can be made to the existing structure, if required. These increased loads can come from longer casing strings, larger drilling rigs needed to handle greater depths, and increased drag from high wellbore inclinations.

TI  - Long-Term Monitoring and Research in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone
AB  - The widely recognized need for large-scale transition from fossil to renewable energy sources has led to renewed effort to obtain metals needed for battery-based electric transportation and other functions. A potential source of some of these metals is the deposits of polymetallic nodules on the deep seafloor. If mining of these deposits proceeds in the coming decade, the enterprise creates an opportunity for extensive, long-term oceanographic research in the mining locations. The need to monitor environmental effects of mining activity can best be met with a near-continuous presence of a research platform in the vicinity. The platform could be a ship or potentially a semi-submersible platform like those used in the offshore oil industry. Such a facility might be supported by a consortium of mining companies and also provide opportunities for academic research in ocean and climate science.

TI  - Optimized modeling of gasturbine power augmentation using steam injection and inlet cooling
AB  - Gas turbines are major equipment in power generation; they are also used as compressor drivers especially in offshore industries and pipeline compressors. Nowadays, rapidly increasing global demand for energy has a major role in selecting efficient equipment. Gas turbine power augmentation is an effective solution for increasing installed GT power. Several methods have been developed for this purpose, but the basic principles of all methods include lowering the inlet air temperature, increasing the inlet mass flow rate, or combination of both mentioned methods. Using these methods such as steam injection, inlet chillers, inlet fogging, injection in combustor, etc., an increasing in turbine output power will be obtained, but the required power of driven compressor changes, so a precise evaluation of overall GT performance, considering its main parts all together and its operating conditions are essential in determining the appropriate method of power augmentation. In this paper first the performance characteristics of the compressor, combustion chamber and power turbine are explained, and then overall performance and efficiency of GT package are discussed. Effect of each power augmentation method is also considered in the following sections. Real data from testing of installed gas turbines and a computer code are executed to validate the proposed technologies. It is concluded that the use of an inlet cooling system together with a steam injection facility improves the efficiency, enhances the output power and makes the GT run at lower pressure ratios at maximum efficiency point.

TI  - Subtropical mangrove wetland is a stronger carbon dioxide sink in the dry than wet seasons
AB  - Coastal mangrove wetlands have an excellent potential in sequestrating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) owing to their high primary productivity as well as slow anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. Yet, there is hitherto a paucity of researches examining the temporal variations and environmental controls of ecosystem-scale CO2 fluxes in subtropical mangroves using quasi-continuous, high temporal resolution measurements. In this study, we measured the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) between the atmosphere and a subtropical estuarine mangrove dominated by Kandelia obovata using an eddy covariance system for two full years to investigate the seasonal variability and key biophysical drivers of NEE. During the wet seasons, the magnitude of increase in ecosystem respiration (Re) was greater than that in gross primary productivity (GPP) owing to a combination of higher temperature and lower percentage of inundation, tidal height and water salinity, which subsequently resulted in an overall decrease in net CO2 uptake as compared to the dry seasons. Our results of path analysis showed that temperature was a dominant control of the temporal variations in CO2 flux during the wet seasons, while its influence became weaker during the dry seasons. On the other hand, an increase in water salinity during the dry seasons had a positive influence on GPP, which was likely related to a greater availability of ions (mainly Clâˆ’ and Na+) in supporting photosynthesis by mangrove trees in this coastal wetland with relatively low salinity (âˆ¼5â€“15 ppt). Our subtropical mangrove wetland was shown to be a significant carbon (C) sink, with annual C uptake rates of 890 and 758 g CO2-C m-2 yrâˆ’1 in the two years of study. We found a strong control of mangrove CO2 fluxes by biophysical factors such as temperature and salinity, implying that global warming and a reduction in water salinity in response to a greater river discharge could potentially reduce the C sink strength of estuarine mangroves in the subtropical regions.

TI  - Case history: Development of a reliable subsea safety system for deepwater drillstem testing
AB  - With the expansion of offshore drill stem testing (DST) to applications in water depths approaching 8,000 feet [2,430.4 m], subsea safety valve equipment has had to undergo reconfiguration to support testing requirements at the increased depths. One of the primary operator concerns for deepwater conditions has been the capability of the subsea test tree to meet the required time constraints for closing and unlatching at the increased depths. In the case of dynamically-positioned drilling ships, for example, the riser must be disconnected in approximately 20 seconds in the event of an emergency. To address the safety needs and comply with the closing requirements of systems at depths greater than 3,000 feet [914.4 m], a computer simulation program was developed to design the most efficient hydraulic circuit possible. As a result of the newly-designed hydraulic circuit, a new actuator for use in deepwater testing applications was also developed. This paper will discuss use of the simulation program and newly-developed actuator and will present a case history that documents the development and capabilities of the first subsea safety system configured for deep water with the new simulation program. The system that was developed operated successfully from a floating rig for 80 days in water depths of 2,700 feet [823 m]. However, the system was designed to operate at depths of up to 8,000 feet [2,430.4 m]. During drill stem testing operations, the time requirements of less than 20 seconds for closing the retainer valve and closing and unlatching the subsea test tree were met with more than 3,300 feet [924.4 m] of hose. These closing times would not have been possible with traditional equipment. Â© 1994, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - A physical-biogeochemical mechanism for negative feedback between marsh crabs and carbon storage
AB  - Tidal marshes are valuable global carbon sinks, yet large uncertainties in coastal marsh carbon budgets and mediating mechanisms limit our ability to estimate fluxes and predict feedbacks with global change. To improve mechanistic understanding, we assess how net carbon storage is influenced by interactions between crab activity, water movement, and biogeochemistry. We show that crab burrows enhance carbon loss from tidal marsh sediments by physical and chemical feedback processes. Burrows increase near-creek sediment permeability in the summer by an order of magnitude compared to the winter crab dormancy period, promoting carbon-rich fluid exchange between the marsh and creek. Burrows also enhance vertical exchange by increasing the depth of the strongly carbon-oxidizing zone and reducing the capacity for carbon sequestration. Results reveal the mechanism through which crab burrows mediate the movement of carbon through tidal wetlands and highlight the importance of considering burrowing activity when making budget projections across temporal and spatial scales.

TI  - Is CO2 capture and storage the right way for mitigating climate change?
AB  - A great number of countries have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) showing, thus, their commitment to solve the carbon dioxide (CO2) issue via various methods including energy efficiency, renewable energies as well as CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS). The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol encourage the Parties to protect and enhance sinks and reservoirs for greenhouse gases including CO2 capture and storage (CCS). However, CCS public acceptance and future implementation require a good scientific knowledge of the environmental consequences of the various storage options including land based and sub-seabed reservoirs and ocean sinks. This is all the more true concerning ocean sinks, which require an in-depth understanding of the effect that a high CO2 concentration in the deep ocean might have on the wider marine environment. This chapter discusses the prospects and consequences of CCS. It presents a comparison of the electricity costs associated to the different methods of CO2 emission reduction. In particular, a comparison is made between the coal and gas power plants with CO2 capture and non-CO2-emission technologies such as nuclear, wind turbine, hydraulic, and solar power. CCS is a viable option to mitigate CO2 emissions. However, even if the cost of CO2 capture becomes fully competitive in the near future, too much rests unknown regarding the sequestration of CO2 including the environmental assessment of long term storage and the international legal framework related to CO2 sequestration.

TI  - Application of the contour line method for estimating extreme response in mooring lines of a two-body floating wave energy converter
AB  - One of design criteria that have been used for the mooring system design for floating platforms in the oil and gas industry is the Ultimate Limit State (ULS). The 100-year level response in the mooring line should be applied for this ULS design check, which is ideally estimated by taking into account the dynamic mooring line tension in all sea state available in the operational site. This is called a full long-term response analysis using the all sea state approach. However, this approach is time consuming. Therefore, it is proposed to use the contour line method to estimate the 100-year response by primarily studying the short term response for the most unfavorable sea states along the 100-year environmental contour line. Experiences in the oil and gas industry confirmed that the method could give good prediction if the response at higher percentile than the median is used. In this paper, the mooring system of a two-body wave energy converter (WEC) is considered. Since this system involves interaction between two bodies, the estimation of the ULS level response by using the all sea state approach will be even more time consuming. Therefore, the application of the contour line method for this case will certainly be beneficial. However, its feasibility for a WEC case needs to be documented first. In the present paper, the ULS level response in the mooring tension that is predicted by the contour line method is compared with that estimated by taking into account all sea states. It is achieved by performing the coupled time domain mooring analyses using SIMO/Riflex for six cases with different mooring configurations and connections between two bodies. An axi-symmetric Wavebob-type WEC is chosen as the object of investigation and the Yeu site in France is assumed to be the operational site of the WEC. Hydrodynamic loads including 2nd order forces are determined using WAMIT. Finally, the applicability of the contour line method to predict the ULS level mooring tension for a two-body WEC is assessed and shown to yield accurate results with proper choice of percentile level for the extreme response.

TI  - Un-locking subsea reserves through a system-based approach for tie-back solutions
AB  - Offshore developments must evolve if the industry is to unlock subsea reserves and increase recovery. A novel method of achieving these goals is through use of a systematic approach to subsea tiebacks that combines new technologies with minor modifications to the existing topsides equipment. The tieback strategy is a system-based approach with a combination of qualified disruptive technologies and field-proven solutions that will improve costs, reduce the number of interfaces, minimize the modifications needed on the topsides, critical for platforms with space and weight limitations, and maximize the use of existing assets. Significant investment was made to qualify disruptive and groundbreaking technologies to make this possible. The following summarizes the main components of the subsea system: - Seabox subsea water treatment and injection provides higher quality water for reservoir injection and increased recovery - Subsea chemical storage that allows longer subsea tiebacks and mitigates weight and space limitations on topside structures; only power and communication are needed from the topside - Subsea treatment of produced water subsea for either discharge directly to sea or to re-inject - Subsea automatic pig launcher combined with a single pipeline that ensures continuous flow at a lower capex - All-electric controls and valves eliminate the need for utility pipelines and expensive umbilicals - Applying field-proven tie-in systems integrated with flexible pipe solutions and customized subsea structures In addition to exploring the above components, this paper also explores combining the components into a comprehensive system. The system-based approach will unlock previously uneconomical reservoirs. Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - The study on overall I&C system scheme for floating nuclear power plant ACP100S and ACP25S
AB  - Floating nuclear power plant (FNPP) is built on the offshore platform and it is defined as a kind of Small and Modular Reactor(SMR) due to its power level. The FNPP can provide power supply, fresh water and high temperature steam and other products. So it can be used as special energy sources, such as regional power supply, district heating and offshore oil exploitation. At present, two types of FNPP, named ACP100S and ACP25S, are developed by China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). In this paper, the overall technical parameters and overall technical scheme of ACP100S and ACP25S are introduced firstly. On the basis of these schemes, the different arrangements of nuclear power plant which are used for meeting the different energy demands are discussed. Due to the different configuration of nuclear power plant, the requirements for the Instrument and Control (I&C) system are different, so the paper discusses some overall configurations of I&C system under the several typical arrangements models, i.e., the single reactor and the single turbine, the double reactors and double turbines, and the double reactors and the single turbine. Furthermore, the characteristics of these overall I&C configurations are analyzed. Â© 2017 Westinghouse Electric Company LLC. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Fish protein concentrates
AB  - Fish protein concentrates (FPC's) have been used in various parts of the world for several centuries. It has only been within the past 30 years, however, that the production of FPC has been investigated on a scientific basis. Today several pilot plants and fullscale industrial plants have been built. Some are now in operation and others will be within a matter of months. Most of these plants produce FPC by solvent (usually isopropyl alcohol) extraction nrocedures. The FPC's produced are, in general, bland tasting and vary in color from white to dark tan. They contain between 75 and 95 percent high-quality protein and they exhibit limited functional properties according to standards set by industry for high protein foodstuffs. The characteristic of limited functional properties, far from being a drawback, is in many circumstances advantageous since FPC can be added to existing food products to markedly improve the nutritional quality without significantly altering other characteristics. Also in some instances, the addition of FPC appears to improve the shelf life of final baked products. One must not assume, however, that all solvent extracted FPC's nor even all isopropyl alcohol extracted FPC's, are completely alike. On the contrary, significant differences in odor, lipid content, stability, taste, nutritional value, and functional properties are obtained depending upon the processing conditions and the species of fish used. Experimental work is now being conducted to produce FPC with various solvents, and with enzymes, microorganisms, or combinations of enzymes and, solvents.

TI  - Analysis of the impact of degradation on gas turbine performance using the support vector machine (svm) method
AB  - Degradation is an important aspect in the operation and maintenance of gas turbines since it affects maintenance costs substantially. Hence, the study of degradation in terms of recoverable and non-recoverable degradation is crucial to formulate a correct maintenance strategy and, as a result, achieve optimum maintenance cost. In this paper, the impact of recoverable and non-recoverable degradation towards compressor discharge pressure, fuel gas flow, and exhaust gas temperature are measured during the start of run period that reflects the time period from the new gas turbine condition to the first scheduled offline crank wash, which normally approximates to 8000 running hours. For the study, a three-unit single speed light industrial gas turbine that drives an electrical generator to power up an offshore platform located in a tropical climate is considered. The measurement of the parameters has been conducted using the support vector machine (SVM) method. Â© Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.

TI  - Alternative strategies of nutrient acquisition and energy conservation map to the biogeography of marine ammonia-oxidizing archaea
AB  - Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are among the most abundant and ubiquitous microorganisms in the ocean, exerting primary control on nitrification and nitrogen oxides emission. Although united by a common physiology of chemoautotrophic growth on ammonia, a corresponding high genomic and habitat variability suggests tremendous adaptive capacity. Here, we compared 44 diverse AOA genomes, 37 from species cultivated from samples collected across diverse geographic locations and seven assembled from metagenomic sequences from the mesopelagic to hadopelagic zones of the deep ocean. Comparative analysis identified seven major marine AOA genotypic groups having gene content correlated with their distinctive biogeographies. Phosphorus and ammonia availabilities as well as hydrostatic pressure were identified as selective forces driving marine AOA genotypic and gene content variability in different oceanic regions. Notably, AOA methylphosphonate biosynthetic genes span diverse oceanic provinces, reinforcing their importance for methane production in the ocean. Together, our combined comparative physiological, genomic, and metagenomic analyses provide a comprehensive view of the biogeography of globally abundant AOA and their adaptive radiation into a vast range of marine and terrestrial habitats.

TI  - The novel technology for reservoir stimulation: in situ generation of carbon dioxide for the residual oil recovery
AB  - The gas and chemical flooding for reservoir stimulation with residual hydrocarbons reserves are highly relevant problem of current oil and gas recovery strategy. The objective of this paper is laboratory study and field implementation of new gas-EOR technologyâ€”in situ carbon dioxide generation technique for CO2-liquid slug formation under oil displacement, increasing the reservoir sweep efficiency and residual oil recovery. This paper presents a summary of a wide range of laboratory tests conducted on different core samples and chemical compositions. Several physical and hydrodynamic phenomena of in situ CO2 generation in highly permeable zones of a porous medium have been investigated as a part of complex study, which involved laboratory tests on the field-scale industrial technology applications, determination of optimal concentrations of foaming agents and inhibiting additives in gas-releasing solutions, etc. The results of laboratory experiments showed that the incremental recovery ranged between 30 and 35% oil original in place. The unique results of the field implementation provide developing an optimal technological scheme of reservoir stimulation with residual oil reserves both onshore and offshore oil fields. Technology of in situ CO2 generation was applied on the group of wells on Penglai offshore oil field (Bohai Bay). Incremental oil production for field operation was 37,740 bbl of crude oil. Theoretical and laboratory studies, as well as the outcomes of industrial implementation of a new method of residual oil recovery, using a CO2-slug confirm technology and economic profitability of the proposed solution.

TI  - Carbon capture and storage - Using CO2 EOR method for economic viability
AB  - Every day, we use energy and every day we ask for more. And with the global population set to rise from 7 to 9 billion by 2050, world energy demand is expected to increase by 50% over the next 20 years alone. Fossil fuels still supply 80% of our energy and we emit enormous quantities of CO2 when we burn them. Carbon dioxide, though not the most potent of greenhouse gases, is the most significant one. Rising CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere has led to evolution of many problems; two important ofthat are - ocean acidification and rising of global temperatures. In order to prevent this large volume of CO2 reaching the atmosphere, there is a need to capture and dispose CO2 in an eco-friendly and economically feasible method. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) method which is essentially a three stage technology where CO2 is captured from large man-made CO2 emission sources, transported via a network of pipelines and stored in deep subsurface geological formations. This paper dissertates on the process of CCS which includes three stages which are: Capture CO2 emissions from large industrial facilities before the CO2 is emitted to the atmosphere. Transport the CO2 through pipelines, and permanently store the CO2 in deep, secure underground rock formations. And also it cogitates on the mutation taking place in this field so as to make this process more expeditious. Here in this paper we have reckoned on the use of carbon dioxide in this process of Enhanced Oil recovery from the oil fields. The conditions under which this EOR method is executable and the effect CO2 has on the underground oil which led to an increase in the recoverable oil has been highlighted. EOR can create a market for CO2 that can generate revenues that could play a vital part in contributing to the large capital investment that is required for Carbon Capture and Storage deployment. The effects of CCS method on environment and loss in the amount of CO2 has also been discussed with referring to a case study which mainly focus on the cost estimate, reduction of CO2 in the environment and the risks assessment of the Carbon Capture and Storage project.

TI  - Discussion on the development of forestry bioenergy in East China Sea areas
AB  - Recently affected both by high oil prices continue to run and environmental pollution and global climate change, the world set off a new round of biomass energy development and utilization. In China the situation that shortage of power seems getting much more serious. But it is well known that less arable land is one of China's basic national conditions. In this context shoreline and other marginal lands to cultivate energy crops for biomass energy play an important role in the field. However in the past two decades the East China Sea environment has faced huge stresses from anthropogenic activities and population growth in the Yangtze River drainage basin and the coastal areas. In order to cope with these environmental problems and provide alternative energy, planting trees is of importance and significance for improving environment and producing renewable biomass energy in the region. Moreover biomass plantations are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide rural people with a diversified source of income and products with multiple uses.

TI  - Lithological and petrophysical core-Log interpretation in CO2 SINK, the European CO2 onshore research storage and verification project
AB  - The storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in saline aquifers is one of the most promising options for Europe to reduce emissions of green-house gases from power plants to the atmosphere and to mitigate global climate change. The CO2SINK (CO2 Storage by Injection into a saline aquifer at Ketzin) project is a research and development (R&amp;D) project, mainly supported by the European Commission, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, and the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology, targeted at developing an in-situ laboratory for CO2 storage. The preparatory phase of the project involved a baseline geological-site exploration and the drilling of one injection and two observation wells, as well as the acquisition of a geophysical baseline and geochemical monitoring, in Ketzin, located near Berlin. The target saline aquifer is the lithologically heterogeneous Triassic Stuttgart formation, situated at approximately 630- to 710-m (2,070- to 2,330-ft) depth. A comprehensive borehole-logging program was performed consisting of routine well logging complemented with an enhanced logging program for one well that recorded nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) and borehole-resistivity images, to characterize the storage formation better. A core analysis program carried out on reservoir rock and caprock included measurements of helium porosity, nitrogen permeability, and brine permeability at different pressure conditions. The saline aquifer at Ketzin shows a variable porosity/perme-ability distribution, which is related to grain size, facies variation, and rock cementation with values in the range from 5 to &gt; 35% and 0.02 to &gt; 5,000 md for porosity and permeability, respectively. On the basis of core analysis and logging data, an elemental log-analysis model for the target formation was established for all three wells. In addition, permeability was estimated using the Coates equation and compared with core data and NMR log-derived permeability, which seems to provide meaningful permeability estimates for the Ketzin reservoir. On the basis of the good core control that guided the petrophysical well-log interpretation in the first two CO 2SINK wells, a porosity and permeability prediction by analogy for the third well is appropriate and applicable. The availability of cores was crucial for a sophisticated formation evaluation at borehole scale that characterizes the real subsurface conditions. Â© 2010 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Review on metal particle contamination in GIS/GIL
AB  - Using SF6 or SF6/N2 mixed gas as insulation medium, GIS/GIL has the characteristics of large capacity, high reliability, and environmental friendliness. Especially it has a great application prospect in the field of UHV transmission and offshore transmission of large-scale wind power. But the metal particle contamination in GIS/GIL is the key technical problem to improve the equipment insulation strength. We introduce the charged mechanism and stress analysis of a metal particle in GIS/GIL, and analyze the influences of AC, DC or impulse voltages on particle motion and GIS/GIL insulation. Furthermore, we compare the typical insulation faults of GIS/GIL caused by particle contamination, namely the gap breakdown caused by moving particles and surface flashover on insulator adhered by particles. In addition,we summarize the current main particle suppression measures and their mechanisms. Finally, we point out the defects of the existing researches in particle pollution of GIS/GIL and put forward some possible solutions. Â© 2016, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

TI  - Modifying bioproduct technology of Medium Density Fibreboard from the seaweed waste Kappaphycus alvarezii and Gracilaria verrucosa
AB  - The effort to conserve Indonesian forest has become the main development priority which is indispensable to maintain the ecosystem balance, as well as thrive to preserve the use of timber wisely. Some alternative products, such as a composite board, are ideal to be developed as the alternative of timber products, as they have a main advantage of having various non-timber waste as the raw materials. One of examples of the timber utilization as the industrial raw material which have bright potential for both domestic and export marketing is the Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF) industry. The last few decades have shown that the need for MDF has been growing rapidly in Asia Pacific and Europe, recorded more than 15\% growth rate per year. MDF is made of lignocellulose fibre combined with synthetic resins or other bondings which are appropriate for the high temperature's and pressure's treatment. The main component to fabricate MDF is lignocellulose which can be obtained from timber, straw, grass, farm/forest waste, industrial waste (timber, paper), and other fiber materials. Lignocellulose contains three main compositions: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The seaweed waste, namely Kappaphycus alvarezii and Gracilaria verrucosa, which experienced the carrageenan extraction and already contain sufficient lignocellulose as the raw material to manufacture MDF. Modifying bioproduct technology of MDF from the seaweed waste (K. alvarezii and G. verrucosa) is an advantageous alternative effort for the sake of both ecosystem balance and environmental friendly technological innovation.

TI  - Mitigation of Extreme Ocean Anoxic Event Conditions by Organic Matter Sulfurization
AB  - Past occurrences of widespread and severe anoxia in the ocean have frequently been associated with abundant geological evidence for free hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the water column, so-called euxinic conditions. Free H2S may react with, and modify, the chemical structure of organic matter settling through the water column and in marine sediments, with hypothesized implications for carbon sequestration. Here, taking the example of Ocean Anoxic Event 2, we explore the potential impact of organic matter sulfurization on marine carbon and oxygen cycling by means of Earth system modeling. Our model experiments demonstrate that rapid sulfurization (ksulfâ‰¥ = 105Â Mâˆ’1Â yearâˆ’1) of organic matter in the water column can drive a more than 30% enhancement of organic carbon preservation and burial in marine sediments and hence help accelerate climate cooling and Ocean Anoxic Event 2 recovery. As a consequence of organic matter sulfurization, we also find that H2S can be rapidly scavenged and the euxinic ocean volume reduced by up to 80%â€”helping reoxygenate the ocean as well as reducing toxic H2S emissions to the atmosphere, with potential implications for the kill mechanism at the end-Permian. Finally, we find that the addition of organic matter sulfurization induces a series of additional feedbacks, including further atmospheric CO2 drawdown and ocean reoxygenation by the creation of a previously unrecognized net source of alkalinity to the ocean as H2S is scavenged and buried.

TI  - Exploring the carbon abatement measures in maritime supply chain: a scenario-based system dynamics approach
AB  - The rapid growth of the global economy has boosted the shipping industry, but it has also increased energy consumption and exhaust emissions. Based on the system dynamics method, we construct a carbon abatement model of maritime supply chain, in which the interaction among company, economy, energy, environment, and policy is deeply analysed. The effect of various carbon abatement measures is simulated with a case study of Shanghai Port. The results prove that the shore power has tremendous potential for reducing emissions. Interestingly, the emission trading scheme has little effect on emission reduction. Conversely, it will increase CO2 emissions because of the vicious circle of higher CO2 production and decreased CO2 treatment capability. Case 4 is the best alternative for reducing CO2 emissions in maritime supply chain when combined measures are applied, regardless of the emission reduction effect or carbon emission intensity. Thus, it is most effective to mobilise all kinds of resources to reduce CO2 emissions when conditions permit. Â© 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Carbon Emission Reduction via HNGLRP CC&S Technology
AB  - The paper objective is to present the successful achievement by Saudi Aramco gas operations to reduce the carbon emission at Hawyiah NGL Recovery Plant (HNGLRP) after successful operation &amp; maintainability of the newly state of the art Carbon Capture &amp; Sequestration (CC&amp;S) technology. This is in line with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) 2030 vision to increase the resources sustainability for future growth and part of Saudi Aramco circular economy in action examples. Saudi Aramco CC&amp;S started in June 2015 at HNGLRP with main objective to capture the carbon dioxide (CO2) from Acid Gas Removal Units (AGRUs) and then inject an annual mass of nearly 750 Kton of carbon dioxide into oil wells for sequestration and enhanced oil recovery maintainability. This is to replace the typical acid gas incineration process after AGRUs operation to reduce carbon footprint. CC&amp;S consists of the followings: integrally geared multistage compressor, standalone dehydration system using Tri-Ethylene Glycol (TEG), CO2 vapor recovery unit (VRU), Granulated Activated Carbon (GAC) to treat water generated from compression and dehydration systems for reuse purpose, and special dense phase pump that transfers the dehydrated CO2 at supercritical phase through 85 km pipeline to replace the typical sea water injection methodology in enhancing oil recovery. CC&amp;S has several new technologies and experiences represented by the compressor capacity, supercritical phase fluid pumping, using mechanical ejector application to maximize carbon recovery, and CO2/TEG dehydration system as non-typical dehydration system. CC&amp;S design considered the occupational health hazards generated from the compressor operation by installing engineering enclosure with proper ventilation system to minimize the noise hazard. CC&amp;S helped HNGLRP to reduce the overall Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission resulted from typical CO2 incineration process (thermal oxidizing). (2) The total GHG resulted from combustion sources at HNGLRP reduced by nearly 30% since CC&amp;S technology in operation. The fuel gas consumption to run the thermal oxidizers in AGRUs reduced by 75% and sent as sales gas instead. The Energy Intensity Index (EII) reduced by 8% since 2015, water reuse index (WRI) increased by 12%. In conclusion, the project shows significant reduction in the carbon emission, noticeable increase in the production, and considerable water reuse. Â© 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers

TI  - Floating photovoltaic power plant: A review
AB  - The noticeable rise in the electricity demand, fast depletion of fossil fuels, along with environmental concerns throughout the world has led to the requirement of commissioning Solar PV plants in large scale. Solar photovoltaic (PV) installation has the burden of intense land requirements which will always be a premium commodity. To conserve the valuable land & water, installing Solar PV system on water bodies like oceans, lakes, lagoons, reservoir, irrigation ponds, waste water treatment plants, wineries, fish farms, dams and canals can be an attractive option. Floating type solar photovoltaic panels have numerous advantages compared to overland installed solar panels, including fewer obstacles to block sunlight, convenient, energy efficiency, higher power generation efficiency owing to its lower temperature underneath the panels. Additionally, the aquatic environment profits by the solar installation because the shading of the plant prevents excessive water evaporation, limits algae growth and potentially improving water quality. This paper gives more insight about the Floating PV technology, its present status & various design options. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - An overview of CO2 mitigation options for global warming - Emphasizing CO2 sequestration options
AB  - CO2 mitigation options have been overviewed from an engineering point of view. There have been proposed a number of mitigation options, which can be divided into three categories; 1. reduction of energy intensity; 2. reduction of carbon intensity; 3. carbon sequestration. In this review paper, various mitigation options are reviewed focusing on the carbon sequestration options. A reduction in energy intensity is essentially an energy saving. A reduction in carbon intensity could be achieved by switching to energy resources with lower carbon contents. Based on the 2001 IPCC report, the mitigation potential related to energy intensity is estimated at 1,900-2,600 Mt-C/year in 2010, and 3,600-5,050 Mt-C/year in 2020, including other greenhouse gas equivalents. There are additional benefits in implementing these options; they are economically beneficial, and have no associated harmful effects. The carbon sequestration options can be divided into two categories; the enhancement of the natural sinking rates of CO2, and a direct discharge of anthropogenic CO2. The relevant sequestration options in the first category include terrestrial sequestration by vegetation, ocean sequestration by fertilization, and an enhancement of the rock weathering process. In the direct discharge options, the CO2 produced from large point sources, such as thermal power stations, would be captured and separated, then transported and injected either into the ocean or underground. Although the sequestration options are less beneficial in terms of cost per unit CO, reduction compared to other options, technical developments in sequestration options are necessary for the following reasons; 1. A huge potential capacity for carbon sequestration, 2. carbon sequestration enables a continuous use of fossil fuels, which is unavoidable at the moment, before switching to renewable energy sources. Each sequestration option has advantages and disadvantages in terms of capacity, cost, the time scale of the sequestration, the stability of sequestered CO2, and additional environmental impacts, which depend on the location, time, and amount of sequestration. Thus, reliable evaluations of the mitigation efficiency are essential for each sequestration option upon implementation.

TI  - Managing Greenhouse gases emission through minimizing the usage of blanketing gas on storage tanks-The Bonny Oil and Gas Terminal Case Study
AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions are primarily responsible for the greenhouse effect, which occurs when thermal radiation from the earth surface is absorbed by these greenhouse gases and radiated back to the earth surface. The consequence of this phenomenon is a rise in the average earth surface temperature. It is established that the earth's natural greenhouse effect makes living on earth possible and comfortable for humans but the activities of humans such as burning of fossil fuels(hydrocarbons) over time has intensified the natural greenhouse effect by significantly increasing the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide resulting in global warming. Global warming has resulted in widespread melting of snow and ice, sea level rise, increased humidity, and increased heat content of the oceans. The Bonny Oil and Gas terminal receives, dehydrates, stabilizes, stores and exports all crude oil produced in SPDC Eastern operations and the processed crude oil is exported by pipeline to tankers and to the nearby NNPC refinery. In the Terminal, LP fuel gas (composed mainly of methane) is used as blanketing gas and is introduced into storage tanks and vessels to prevent a vacuum from developing when liquid is removed from a tank to maintain the desired blanket pressure and prevent outside air from contaminating the tank or creating a flammable or explosive environment. It also ensures that a constant gas pressure is maintained in the vapour space of a storage tank. Efficient blanketing gas demand would ensure that pressure relief from tanks and vessels which ultimately result in greenhouse gas emissions are minimized. This is implemented through the use of split range control scheme for blanketing gas on fixed roof storage tanks in the Export Terminal. In a split range control scheme, the output of the controller is split and sent to two final control elements (pressure control valves).The splitter is configured to define how each pressure control valve will open. The first valve which allows inflow of blanket gas to the tank opens when the output is of the range 0-45% while the second pressure control valve to the flare opens at an output range of 55%-100%. The deployment of this control scheme of blanketing gas on fixed roof storage tanks in Bonny Terminal has resulted in the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions, combating climate change, process optimization, and significant energy savings.

TI  - Advanced Optimized Weather Routing for an OceanGoing Vessel
AB  - Based on current growth patterns in the global economy, there are projections that there will be an overall increase in the emissions of harmful gases from ships. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) requires the preparation of management plans to improve the efficiency of ship navigation. Moreover, shipping companies should pay careful attention to fuel consumption and environmental conservation. In this paper, we propose a newly developed weather-routing optimization technology that focuses on fuel-consumption minimization and energy-efficiency operational indicator (EEOI) minimization while on voyages. We consider the constant variations in the sea and weather conditions, including wind, wave, and current conditions. This is achieved by performing a cost-function minimization. The cost function is calculated by performing an entire maneuvering simulation from a transoceanic voyage's starting point to its end point by solving horizontal differential equations of motion such as those related to the yaw, sway, and surge. The simulations consider the ship's hull force, propeller thrust, rudder force, wave force, and wind force. Both sets of results obtained in this study for the optimal routes are reasonable because the values of EEOI and FOC are reduced compared with the values for the great circle route, which is the shortest path between the two points. On the other hand, the optimized route in the EEOI minimization calculation does not provide the FOC minimum value.

TI  - Identifying and quantifying major hazard for platforms deck raising using synchronous hydraulic jacking system
AB  - Lima Flow Station is one of the gathering manned stations of Pertamina Hulu Energy Offshore North West Java (PHEONWJ) which is located in Java Sea, Indonesia. The Lima Flow Station consists of four bridge linked platforms and a bridge linked flare structure. Lima Flow Station had experienced subsidence for about 3 meters since it was built in 1973 to early 2013. The subsidence caused significant reduction in the platform air gaps (distance between cellar deck bottom of steel and maximum wave height) which caused Lima Flow Station to not be reliable for safe operation. The synchronous hydraulic jacking system was selected to raise the platform to 4 meters elevation and remedy the air gap for safe operation. Three platforms, Flare tripods, and interconnecting bridges were raised while one platform was not raised as it was isolated and utilized as a muster point and for personnel transfer purposes only. The same technology has been successfully applied in Gulf of Mexico in 2006. Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) study was conducted for the design of a synchronous hydraulic jacking system to measure whether the design provided tolerable risk or not and identify mitigation of any intolerable risk. The assessment was carried out in two main parts: hazard identification in the form of failure modes, effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) to determine major accident events to be carried forward into the QRA; and determination of the impact of safety risk to personnel and assessment of financial risks in the form of delays to resumption of production. FMECA was used for qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis of engineering systems. The reviewed system was divided into system, subsystem, and equipment. Failure mode, cause, safeguard and effectJconsequence for equipment are identified. High consequence was considered as major accident and was further studied in QRA. QRA consisted of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to estimate the probability of a major accident event identified by FMECA, Event Tree Analysis (ETA) to estimate the probability of a major accident leading to the ultimate event, Consequence analysis to estimate the impact of the ultimate event, risk estimation by multiplying probability and impact of ultimate event, risk assessment by comparing estimated risk and risk criteria, and identification of mitigation for any major accident having intolerable risk. FMECA has identified some major accident events caused by misalignment and structural failure during deck rising. The results of the QRA determined that the individual risk per annum for the most exposed individual was still within tolerable risk of company's criteria as the deck raising was conducted during shutdown and minimum manning level. While the financial risk was high for platform damage due to structural failure for lifted platforms as there was no detection method for structural failure and sudden movement in case of structural failure may cause major damage. The financial loss was mostly contributed by production loss. The major contributor for structural failure was weld failure. Recommendation was raised to minimize the risk by providing extra quality check for welding and material of structural parts on fabrication and installation. By implementing good project and risk management, Lima Flow Station Deck Raising has completed successfully and started up in 2013 without any accident. Copyright Â© (2014) by AIChE.

TI  - Soil greenhouse gas emissions reduce the contribution of mangrove plants to the atmospheric cooling effect
AB  - Mangrove soils have been recognized as sources of greenhouse gases, but the atmospheric fluxes are poorly characterized, and their adverse warming effect has rarely been considered with respect to the potential contribution of mangrove wetlands to climate change mitigation. The current study balanced the warming effect of soil greenhouse gas emissions with the plant carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration rate derived from the plants' net primary production in a productive mangrove wetland in South China to assess the role of mangrove wetlands in reducing the atmospheric warming effect. Soil characteristics were also studied in the summer to examine their relationships with gas fluxes. The soil to atmosphere fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and CO2 ranged from-1.6 to 50.0 mu gm(-2) h(-1), from-1.4 to 5360.1 mu gm(-2) h(-1) and from-31 to 512 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively, which indicated that the mangrove soils act as sources of greenhouse gases in this area. The gas fluxes were higher in summer than in the cold seasons and were variable across mangrove sites. Gas fluxes in summer were positively correlated with the soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and ammonia contents. The mangrove plants sequestered a considerable amount of atmospheric CO2 at rates varying from 3652 to 7420 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1). The ecosystem acted as a source of CH4 and N2O gases but was a more intenseCO(2) sink. However, the warming effect of soil gas emissions accounted for 9.3-32.7\% of the plant CO2 sequestration rate, partially reducing the benefit of mangrove plants, and the two trace gases comprised 9.7-33.2\% of the total warming effect. We therefore propose that an assessment of the reduction of atmospheric warming effects by a mangrove ecosystem should consider both soil greenhouse gas emissions and plant CO2 sequestration.

TI  - Mitigating the atmospheric CO2 increase and ocean acidification by adding limestone powder to upwelling regions
AB  - The feasibility of enhancing the absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere by adding calcium carbonate (CaCO3) powder to the ocean and of partially reversing the acidification of the ocean and the decrease in calcite supersaturation resulting from the absorption of anthropogenic CO2 is investigated. CaCO3 could be added to the surface layer in regions where the depth of the boundary between supersaturated and unsaturated water is relatively shallow (250-500 m) and where the upwelling velocity is large (30-300 m a(-1)). The CaCO3 would dissolve within a few 100 m depth below the saturation horizon, and the dissolution products would enter the mixed layer within a few years to decades, facilitating further absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere. This absorption of CO2 would largely offset the increase in mixed layer pH and carbonate supersaturation resulting from the upwelling of dissolved limestone powder. However, if done on a large scale, the reduction in atmospheric CO2 due to absorption of CO2 by the ocean would reduce the amount of CO2 that needs to be absorbed by the mixed layer, thereby allowing a larger net increase in pH and in supersaturation in the regions receiving CaCO3. At the same time, the reduction in atmospheric pCO(2) would cause outgassing of CO2 from ocean regions not subject to addition of CaCO3, thereby increasing the pH and supersaturation in these regions as well. Geographically optimal application of 4 billion t of CaCO3 a(-1) (0.48 Gt C a(-1)) could induce absorption of atmospheric CO2 at a rate of 600 Mt CO2 a(-1) after 50 years, 900 Mt CO2 a(-1) after 100 years, and 1050 Mt CO2 a(-1) after 200 years.

TI  - Macro energy trends and the future of geothermal within the low-carbon energy portfolio
AB  - Exploratory analysis was conducted to understand energy diversification trends within the oil, gas, and power industry and to examine whether geothermal technologies play a role in the low-carbon energy mix. Investigations were completed using the 2018 end of year financial reports for 36 companies. Macro-scale insights reveal a significant split between European and US-based oil and gas companies in terms of strategy which is mirrored by the power companies. Diversification into low-carbon technologies is driving an energy convergence between the oil and gas and power sectors. Presently, the oil and gas industry is not actively investing in geothermal technologies, favoring instead solar photovoltaic (solar PV), onshore/offshore wind, biomass/gas, gas to power and storage. The macro-scale analysis is coupled with, 20, semi-structured interviews with geothermal and energy specialists. The interviews provided an insight why oil and gas companies have resisted entering the geothermal industry. In addition the interviews were organized into a Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental, PESTLE, analysis to understand the present-day external environment of the geothermal industry in the USA today. The combined analyses indicate that the regulatory, business and finance environment for geothermal, in the USA, is challenging. Recent geothermal innovations that increase the footprint of the geothermal industry, offering new scalable, low-carbon base-load concepts, might provide an avenue for the oil and gas industry to enter the geothermal domain, while leveraging their existing core competencies, intellectual property (IP), technology, assets, and workforce knowledge skills and experience.

TI  - Organic carbon in seagrass sediments is influenced by seagrass canopy complexity, turbidity, wave height, and water depth
AB  - Seagrass meadows are important marine carbon sinks, yet they are threatened and declining worldwide. Seagrass management and conservation requires adequate understanding of the physical and biological factors determining carbon content in seagrass sediments. Here, we identified key factors that influence carbon content in seagrass meadows across several environmental gradients in Moreton Bay, SE Queensland. Sampling was conducted in two regions: (1) Canopy Complexity, 98 sites on the Eastern Banks, where seagrass canopy structure and species composition varied while turbidity was consistently low; and (2) Turbidity Gradient, 11 locations across the entire bay, where turbidity varied among sampling locations. Sediment organic carbon content and seagrass structural complexity (shoot density, leaf area, and species specific characteristics) were measured from shallow sediment and seagrass biomass cores at each location, respectively. Environmental data were obtained from empirical measurements (water quality) and models (wave height). The key factors influencing carbon content in seagrass sediments were seagrass structural complexity, turbidity, water depth, and wave height. In the Canopy Complexity region, carbon content was higher for shallower sites and those with higher seagrass structural complexity. When turbidity varied along the Turbidity Gradient, carbon content was higher at sites with high turbidity. In both regions carbon content was consistently higher in sheltered areas with lower wave height. Seagrass canopy structure, water depth, turbidity, and hydrodynamic setting of seagrass meadows should therefore be considered in conservation and management strategies that aim to maximize sediment carbon content.

AB  - Aimed at the problems of unmanned marine exploration vessels, such as the short voyage time and the limited sensing ability caused by sensor failure under complex marine environments, a long-range unmanned ocean-air stereo exploration vessel driven by wind and solar energy is developed. An elevating ducted wind turbine is designed for high efficiency and low starting wind speed, and a deployable solar photovoltaic power generation system is developed. Therefore, wind power and solar energy can be utilized to realize a hybrid system, which overcomes the instability of single energy power supply, and effectively ensures the endurance of unmanned exploration vessel. Then, a ship-borne tethered ummanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system is developed with an autonomous takeoff and landing control section. Finally, the information fusion technology of ship borne and airborne sensors is adopted to greatly improve the perception ability of the unmanned ship to the surrounding environment and the function of three-dimension detection of sea and air.

TI  - Productivity Gains from Offshore Outsourcing: Evidence from the Chinese Manufacturing Industry
AB  - Using the Cobb-Douglas production function and vertical specialization share, the present paper measures the productivity spillover effects of offshore outsourcing in the Chinese manufacturing industry. We examine different production factors and the degree of openness by dividing the Chinese manufacturing industry into five major categories: capital-intensive business, technological-intensive business, labor-intensive business, open business and non-open business. The results show that offshore outsourcing is positively associated with productivity in the Chinese manufacturing industry as a whole, but less so in labor-intensive industries and more in capital-intensive industries. Moreover, the positive impact of outsourcing on productivity is slightly higher in open industries than in non-open industries. These results shed light on the differential spillover effects of offshore outsourcing on productivity. Our findings suggest that outsourcing structure is important to China's long-run competitive advantage. China's policy-makers should encourage further offshore capital-intensive and technology-intensive activities and focus more on outward-oriented offshore businesses.

TI  - Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Capture and Release with a Redox-Active Amine
AB  - Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from the combustion of fossil fuels is a major contributor to global climate change and ocean acidification. The implementation of carbon capture and storage technologies has been proposed to mitigate the buildup of this greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Among these technologies, direct air capture is regarded as a plausible CO2 removal tool whereby net negative emissions can be achieved. However, the separation of CO2 from air is particularly challenging due to the ultradilute concentration of CO2 in the presence of high concentrations of dioxygen and water. Here, we report a robust electrochemical redox-active amine system demonstrating a high electron utilization (i.e., mole of CO2 per mole of electrons) of up to 1.25 with the capture of two CO2 molecules per amine in an aqueous solution with a work of 101 kJe per moles of CO2. The capture of CO2 directly from ambient air as the feed gas presented an electron utilization of 0.78. Â© 2022 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.

TI  - Perspectives for the sustainable use of fossil fuels in Brazil with carbon sequestration in geological reservoirs
AB  - Brazil is in search of clean energy options in accordance to country's voluntary commitment to mitigate climate change. Carbon sequestration in geological reservoirs is one of the most promising technologies for the sustainable use of fossil fuels and, thus, many actions are being conducted to assure country readiness for this technology. These actions include capacity building, establishment of appropriated R&amp;D infra-structure, e.g., CEPAC (Carbon Storage Research Center), and implementation of CO2 storage research, development, pilot, and demonstration projects in four onshore sedimentary basins and in the offshore Campos Basin. The projects aim to assure CO2 storage capacity and effectiveness in deep brine aquifers, coal seams, and petroleum fields to store CO2 for thousands of years. Pilot projects are expected to wherein âˆ¼. 0.3 million ton/yr of CO2 will be injected by 2014. Demonstration projects are planned to store 3.9 million ton/yr of CO2 in the Campos Basin by 2008, 1.9 million ton/yr CO2 in the Potiguar Basin by 2011, etc. The amount of CO2 stored per year in demonstration projects by 2014 will be 90 million ton/yr CO2 to 18% of Petrobras' present-day emissions.

TI  - Cooperative optimization of shore power allocation and berth allocation: A balance between cost and environmental benefit
AB  - Shore power is the use of shore-side electricity to satisfy ships' electricity demand during berthing at ports. It is an effective measure of reducing the emissions produced by auxiliary engines of ships at berth. This paper develops a cooperative optimization method to model the problem of whether to allocate shore power for each berth and which berth is allocated for the stochastic arriving ship. The cooperative optimization method is to minimize the total cost of installing and using shore power systems and maximize the environmental benefit of reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Considering the emission of different pollutants can't be directly accumulated as the objective, different pollutants are uniformly expressed as economic penalties by imposing environmental taxes and then economic penalties are regarded as the objective of environmental benefits. Firstly, the problem is carried out by proposing a multi-objective cooperative optimization model from the perspective that both shipping and port companies take overall benefits of port supply chains as the optimization target. Next, the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to resolve the model. Then, a proposed bulk terminal/wharf is taken as an example to conduct experiments for gaining optimal solutions under different carbon pricing policy scenarios. After then, based on the proposed preference-based decision-making method, optimal decisions under different preference are obtained. Finally, in order to analyze the applicability and generalizability of the model, experiments are conducted to analyze the impact of environmental tax rates on results and berthing time on environmental benefits. The results show that optimal solutions can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides, nitrous oxides and particulate matters by at least 3.8\% while reducing the total cost by 35.9\%, compared with the baseline scheme. Meanwhile optimal solutions can reduce emissions by up to 100\%, but increase the total cost by 183.7\%. Besides, the proposed model has good applicability when the berthing time and environmental tax rates change. In conclusion, the developed method can be widely used for popularizing shore power, promoting port sustainable development, reducing global air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of precipitation strengthened nibase superalloys
AB  - This paper discusses the results of an on-going investigation to rank the hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of precipitation strengthened Ni-based superalloys using a rising step load (RSL) technique in four-point bending. Alloys characterized include UNS N07716, UNS N09925, and UNS N07718 heat treated to various strength conditions. Hydrogen was introduced either in-situ via an applied cathodic potential (external hydrogen) or prior to testing by thermally charging in gaseous hydrogen (internal hydrogen). The RSL method measures the stress intensity required to cause propagation of a pre-existing flaw with and without the presence of hydrogen. Another method used to evaluate hydrogen embrittlement is the slow strain rate test, which characterizes material through the relative loss in ductility due to hydrogen exposure. While both methods provide a relevant measure of hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility, fracture mechanics testing such as the RSL method offers more useful information for the design of components. Results indicate hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility is related to both the microstructure and the composition of the alloy. Measured fracture toughness values are also affected by the method of hydrogen exposure, however general trends among the materials are seen. In light of these results, the relative merits of the RSL testing method compared to slow strain rate testing is addressed, with a focus on overall applicability. Failures attributed to hydrogen embrittlement of Ni-based superalloys in off-shore wells have emphasized the need to identify the limitations of these alloys in environments where the potential for hydrogen embrittlement exist.

TI  - THE INSTALLATION OF FLEXIBLE RISERS AND FLOWLINES SYSTEMS WITH PLET ON THE SUBSEA END
AB  - Flexible riser and flowline systems used in offshore oil and gas developments in shallow and deep water are typically terminated with vertical connectors with goosenecks or with horizontal connectors. An alternative arrangement is to terminate with PLET although it is not as commonly adopted. PLETs usually have a sizeable dimension and weight compared to the vertical and horizontal connectors hence present handling and deployment issues. A number of flexible risers and flowlines terminated with PLETs recently installed in a deepwater development in Gulf of Mexico showed that with careful engineering such deployment is viable and can be performed safely by a typical flexlay vessel. The installation engineering, installation aid requirements, the deployment methodology are presented and discussed. The observations from ensuing offshore operation showed that the flexible torsion and twist during deployment need to be carefully monitored and managed offshore. Flexibles terminated with PLETs could be potentially suitable where life of field gooseneck load may be excessive or for bigger and stiffer flexible products where making the 2nd end connections might be a challenging undertaking offshore. A PLET could also be used where an intermediate structure is required along a MEG line for example where In-Line Terminations (ILTs) are needed for flying leads plug-in. This would save on requirement for an intermediate structure and connectors.

TI  - Flare emission reduction utilizing solid oxide fuel cells at a natural gas processing plant
AB  - The oil and gas sector produces a substantial volume of emissions mainly generated from flaring, which adds to the total energy loss in oil and gas plants and significantly impacts air quality. Therefore, reducing and recovering flare gas is essential since it benefits economic efficiency and environmental protection objectives. Several options have been developed for flare gas recovery. One of the promising approaches is integrating solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) into natural gas operations. The integration of SOFCs with a flare system in a natural gas processing plant that produces two billion standard cubic feet of natural gas daily reduces the emissions and generates electricity using the complimentary fuel. Moreover, by maintaining the flame's heating value at the flare tip to ensure the plant's safety requirement, 70% of the flare gas can be fed to SOFC as fuel. In an on-shore plant, SOFCs are fueled by 3.5 million standard cubic feet of purge gas, which will reduce the CO2 eq. per day from 263 tons to 101 tons and generates 20 MW of electricity. For the off-shore plant, the fuel for SOFCs is around 105 thousand standard cubic feet of purge gas, which reduces the CO2 eq. per day from 9 tons to 3 tons and generates 600 kW of electricity. Utilizing SOFCs in the natural gas flare system will generate extra electricity using waste gases and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Â© 2021 The Authors

TI  - Environmental impact of offshore brine disposal associated with petroleum storage activities
AB  - In September 1977 engineers and scientists at Texas A&M University began a study to assess the environmental impact of the eventual discharge of a brine effluent from the Bryan Mound site of the Department of Energy's Strategic Petroleum Reserve Program. This site is the first of several storage sites planned for the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The brine effluent of up to 680, 000 barrels per day at 90% saturation is the result of leaching storage caverns in the underground salt dome at Bryan Mound near Freeport, Texas, or the result of filling already leached caverns with petroleum. The organization and management philosophy for an interdisciplinary team of principal investigators is discussed. The primary project study areas are physical oceanography, analysis of the discharge plume, water and sediment quality, nekton, benthos, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and these areas are supported by management, field and data management components . This paper summarizes the results from the predisposai and intensive postdisposal periods. During these periods, the project has generated a unique collection of base line data which have been collected for coastal waters over an extended period of time and placed in the public domain. These records include three years of continuous physical oceanography data, at a single point and one year of both cross shelf and longshore measurements with a three meter-three depth array, three years of benthic data over a wide cross shelf grid, three years of bi-monthly nekton sampling and 1 year of monthly day-night sampling over a grid extending 25 miles offshore, extensive water and sediment analysis, and one year of monthly zooplankton and phytoplankton data. Results of these programs and the brine plume measurement and an initial evaluation of the nature and extent of the brine impact are discussed. Â© Copyright 1981 Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Carbon addition as a countermeasure against biological invasion by plants
AB  - Increased nitrogen availability is known to favor invasion by non-native plants into natural grasslands. This suggests that decreasing nitrogen availability might serve as a countermeasure against invasion. One way to at least temporarily decrease nitrogen availability to plants is to increase microbial nitrogen uptake by adding carbon to the soil, and sawdust is a carbon source whose low cost could make it a practical conservation tool. To test whether adding sawdust to soil can counter the tendency of nitrogen enrichment to promote invasions by non-native plants, we hand-tilled 1.5 kg sawdust/m2 into the upper soil of the bare, nitrogen-rich patches left by dead shrubs of the nitrogen-fixing shrub Lupinus arboreus in two nearby areas with contrasting levels of invasion in a coastal grassland in northern California. After two years, in both areas, patches with sawdust had 40% less biomass of non-native plants than patches without sawdust, whereas biomass of native plants was not affected by sawdust addition. The more negative effect of sawdust on non-native species was specifically due to an effect on non-native grasses; adding sawdust increased the frequency of both native and non-native forbs. Results suggest that adding carbon as sawdust to soil can help counter invasion of grassland by non-native plants when invasion is being promoted by increased nitrogen availability, especially when the major invasive species are grasses.

TI  - Geothermal energy versus CCS AND CCU [Geotermia A CCS I CCU]
AB  - The issue of potential conflict of interests between CO2 geological storage in saline aquifers (CCS - Carbon Capture and Storage) and low-enthalpy geothermal energy is often raised by opponents of the CCS in Poland and other European countries of similar geological conditions. However, contrary to those opponents, processes accompanying CO2 injection into deep saline aquifers can be simultaneously used for both sequestration and associated production of clean energy. Sedimentary formations occurring in the Permian-Mesozoic Basin, covering the Northern Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands North Sea, eastern England and more than a half of the territory of Poland contain deep waters of variable salinity. It is possible to combine geothermal and CCS, both in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and for cost-efficient heat and/or electricity generation. The first concept is the use of CO 2 in closed, unconventional geothermal systems (HDR - Hot Dry Rock). In case of HDR fracturing is carried out in order to enhance reservoir properties of rocks at depth of at least 3 km, reaching a temperature of minimum 95-100Â° C, sufficient for heat and electricity generation. This method combines the geothermal energy and CO2 injection instead of water in a closed loop. Therefore, this method should be classified mostly as CCU, subordinately as CCS. Although it does not neutralize huge amounts of CO 2 in comparison with conventional geological storage (only about 10% of injected gas is ultimately stored in the host rock), the CCU method is much desired and produces geothermal energy with much better efficiency than the classical geothermal loop using water as a medium transporting the heat - which is the main economical and ecological advantage of this method. The second concept uses sedimentary rocks of good reservoir properties, containing saline aquifers, usually less suitable for geothermal because of high corrosivity and generally weak thermal properties (at least in Poland). CO2 is injected into the saline aquifer, and appears at depth of minimum 800 m in a phase similar to a liquid, but of density lower than brine, so it remains on top as a plume. If most of the injected CO2 remains in the aquifer (i.e. it is sequestered), part of it is re-circulated in a closed loop for the heat exchange or electricity generation in a turbine. At the depth of more than 800 m, in the temperature of tens of C degrees plus, the carbon dioxide transmits the heat/energy stream several times more efficiently than the water/brine medium, which makes economic sense of such an approach.

TI  - Fine root biomass and its contribution to the mangrove communities in three saline zones of Sundarbans, Bangladesh
AB  - Globally, sea levels are rising due to climate change which would influence the salinity levels in mangroves. In the framework of this study, we focused on the influence of salinity and differences of forest structure on the fine root biomass (FRB) and carbon stocks in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh. Also, the relationships FRB to different stand structural parameters were investigated using the data obtained from 50 sample plots (100 sq. m each) in different salinity zones in Sundarbans. Four random soil samples (30 cm in length) were taken within study plots, which were further divided into 10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm to identify the most active soil layer for FRB stocks. Results suggest differences in forest structural parameters and diversity indices with salinity changes in different saline zones. The low and medium saline zone is dominated by Heriteira fomes, while Excoecaria agallocha dominates the high saline zone. The carbon stocks (Mg C ha(-1)) in Sundarbans show a significant decrease with increasing salinity in different saline zones, e.g. oligohaline (252 +/- 60.2), mesohaline (199 +/- 37.7), and polyhaline (171 +/- 20.0) zone. FRB carbon (Mg C ha(-1)) allocation in different saline zones also followed a decreasing order, such as oligohaline (12.8), mesohaline (7.9), and polyhaline (7.3). Fine mot biomass showed a decreasing trend with increasing soil depth, where the differences, however, were not significant (p > 0.05) among the soil layers. Our results provide evidence on FRB variations in Sundarbans, which has implications on the mangrove species conservation and management. The mature stands at different saline zones of Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh has a high fine root biomass, which is valuable for mangrove restoration and the studied species plantation in the shore line or coastal area which can help to decrease the erosion effects of tidal inundation.

TI  - Establishing decommissioning capability
AB  - Decommissioning projects are rare in this region (South East Asia), thus opportunities for benefitting from firsthand experience are quite limited. According to The Offshore O&amp;G Decommissioning Market 2013-2023, similarly throughout the North Sea, the Norwegian sector has limited experience with Decommissioning1. As the Asia operators were focused on developing technologies to unlock and produce new reserves, they are still in an infancy stage when it comes to decommissioning. Perhaps timing is the key to the development of decommissioning activities and knowledge in Asia. The timing of "Peak Oil" where numbers of ceased Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) are increasing and at the same time the operators are chasing extraction technologies to increase the ultimate recovery factors of oil and gas. The time is near where it is uneconomical for the Asian operators to continue to produce oil and gas and hence decommissioning of facilities is the only the next step. Bearing in mind that decommissioning of oil and gas fields is regulated by international law, the need for improving this capability is there. Evidently, it takes a big nudge from external stakeholders to shape the decommissioning industry, very similar to how energy demand shaped the oil price today. United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) Article 60(3), states that "Any installations or structures which are abandoned or disused shall be removed to ensure safety of navigation, taking into account any generally accepted standards established in this regard by the competent international organisation. Such removal shall also have due regard to fishing, the protection of the marine environment and the rights and duties of other States. Appropriate publicity shall be given to the depth, position and dimensions of any installations or structures not entirely removed." This paper aims to demonstrate how a reputable global upstream operator builds its capabilities from scratch through a collaboration of selected in-house experts, working together to establish in-house decommissioning capabilities in three (3) key domains; [1] Technical know-how; [2] Cost estimating models, and; [3] Standardization of Project Management System.

TI  - Offshore technology emphasis is on subsea completions
AB  - Worldwide offshore drilling operations are trending increasingly toward subsea completions to exploit fields that are small, marginal and/or in harsh environments. Offshore technology is shifting accordingly, with more products tailored to the needs of subsea wells. A review is presented of new devices. Among them are: A template/manifold that permits simplified production from directional wells, as well as drilling in deep water. There is also a subsea wellhead control system that is truly autonomous, a subsea wireline system that deploys from small vessels, a subsea production system for oil fields with associated gas that utilizes a 'floater,' and an economical subsea separator for submarginal (less than 30 MMbbl) fields.

TI  - Climate engineering through artificial enhancement of natural forcings: Magnitudes and implied consequences
AB  - Explosive volcanism and solar activity changes have modulated the Earth's temperature over short and century time scales. Associated with these external forcings were systematic changes in circulation. Here, we explore the effect of similar but artificially induced forcings that mimic natural radiative perturbations in order to stabilize surface climate. Injection of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere, not unlike the effects from large volcanic eruptions, and a direct reduction of insolation, similar to total solar irradiance changes, are tested in their effectiveness to offset global mean temperature rise resulting from a business-as-usual scenario, thereby reducing surface temperatures to conditions associated with committed warming of a year 2000 stabilization scenario. This study uses a coupled Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model to illustrate the character of resulting climate and circulation anomalies when both enhanced greenhouse (A2 scenario) and opposing geoengineering perturbations are considered. First we quantify the magnitude of the required perturbation and compare these artificial perturbations to the natural range of the respective forcing. Then, we test the effectiveness of the "correction" by looking at the regional climate response to the combined forcing. It is shown that widespread warming could be reduced, but overcompensation in the tropics is necessary because sea ice loss in high latitudes cannot be reversed effectively to overcome higher ocean heat content and enhanced zonal winter circulation as well as the continuous IR forcing. The magnitude of new, greenhouse gas-countering anthropogenic forcing would have to be much larger than what natural forcing from volcanoes and solar irradiance variability commonly provide.

TI  - Greenhouse Gas Fluxes of Mangrove Soils and Adjacent Coastal Waters in an Urban, Subtropical Estuary
AB  - Mangroves are known to sequester carbon at rates exceeding even those of other tropical forests; however, to understand carbon cycling in these systems, soil-atmosphere fluxes and gas exchanges in mangrove-adjacent shallow waters need to be quantified. Further, despite the ever-increasing impact of development on mangrove systems, there is even less data on how subtropical, greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes are affected by urbanization. We quantified carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from mangrove soils and adjacent, coastal waters along a gradient of urbanization in the densely-populated, subtropical San Juan Bay Estuary (PR). Edaphic (salinity, pH, surface temperature) factors among sites significantly covaried with GHG fluxes. We found that mangrove systems in more highly-urbanized reaches of the estuary were characterized by relatively lower porewater salinities and substantially larger GHG emissions, particularly CH4, which has a high global warming potential. The magnitude of the CO2 emissions was similar in the mangrove soils and adjacent waters, but the CH4 emissions in the adjacent waters were an order of magnitude higher than in the soils and showed a marked response to urbanization. This study underscores the importance of considering GHG emissions of adjacent waters in carbon cycling dynamics in urbanized, tropical mangrove systems.

TI  - Development of gel systems for pipeline dewatering and drying applications
AB  - Dewatering a long pipeline requires special considerations regarding the design of the dewatering train components. Gels constitute a critical part of a dewatering train. This paper discusses the functional specifications that have been developed to select appropriate gels for a given application. These specifications pertain to thermal, chemical, and shear stabilities; contamination sensitivity resulting from dilution with other fluids; drying characteristics; solids content left in the pipeline upon drying; lubricity of sealing elements in the pigs; and fluid rheology to prevent fluid bypass. In addition to these properties, the gels selected should also be environmentally disposable. This paper also discusses the numerous criteria (biological degradation, ease of on-site quality control, etc.) developed for the gel selection process. Laboratory testing procedures applicable to long-term stability because of long pipeline lengths have also been discussed. The developed gel systems have been successfully employed in the dewatering of two subsea pipelines of the Zeepipe system in the North Sea: (1) a 40-in. diameter, 505-mi. (814-km) long pipeline and (2) a 20-in. diameter, 155-mi. (250-km) long pipeline. The performance of these gels has been excellent as verified through tests of fluid samples before and after the train travels. As a result of this study, water-based and methanol-based gels have been developed that provide excellent performance. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to design and operate dewatering trains even for long pipelines with virtually no gas bypass. The contributions of this paper are the functional specifications and the methodology for the development of appropriate gels for pipeline dewatering/drying applications. The laboratory-based simulations of the dilution and shearing of gels during the train travel will also be useful. Â© 1994, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Air pollution from ships: Recent developments
AB  - All developments on air pollution by ships are fairly recent. Annex VI of the international Marpol-convention, regulating the emissions of CFCs, Halons, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) from cargoes, emissions from incinerators and exhaust gas emissions from engines (NOx and SOx) entered into force in May 2005. The International Maritime Organization is currently discussing an upgrade of the air pollution issues covered by Annex VI and some that are not in Annex VI, such as greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas emitted by ship. Fuel consumption by the world merchant fleet is expected to grow to between 250-300 million tons per year with corresponding CO2 emissions of 800-960 million tons per year. In Western Europe land based measures have reduced sulphur emissions substantially, leaving shipping as an important remaining source of these emissions. Average sulphur content of heavy fuel oils is 3%, with a limit of 4.5% imposed by Annex VI. Both the Baltic- and the North Sea have the status of SOx emission control area, limiting sulphur content to 1.5%. A significant reduction of the emissions of sulphur oxides from ships is technically possible. One way is to reduce the sulphur content in heavy fuels, but there are several drawbacks. The first is that many refineries do not have the facility to produce low sulphur fuels in large quantities. They may have to invest in new installations, which takes time. The second is that desulphurization costs a lot of energy. There is a penalty in the form of additional CO2 emissions from the refineries. The third is that investing in desulphurization may be less attractive than in investing to produce more light products. Other ways to reduce SOx emissions are the use of low sulphur distillates or exhaust gas cleaning. As to NOx emissions it is believed that new technologies allow a further stepwise reduction of these emissions. Regulations may follow what is feasible. For VOCs, so far Annex VI provides for the possibility to address these emissions (cargo vapours) from ships. There is a tendency to use the possibility and actually reduce these emissions. New elements may enter Annex VI in due course. Addressing particulate matter and PAH's may be among these. Local air quality in some ports provokes looking at all kinds of possibilities to reduce local air pollution. Again ships' emissions are becoming relatively more important as land based emissions are diminishing. In growing economies, more shipping also means more ship based pollution in absolute figures. "Cold ironing", i.e. electric power from shore based plants to ships (instead of power supply by the ships' diesel generators) is among the possibilities that have been discussed during the last 10 years. It remains to be seen if this issue will at the stage of practical application on a large scale. Â© 2007 World Maritime University.

TI  - Including the reefer chain into genuine beef cold chain architecture based on blockchain technology
AB  - Improving the cold chain system for perishable foods would both increase food safety by maintaining quality and reduce business operation costs by minimizing food loss from inappropriate management. This has led to various attempts to apply blockchain technology (BCT) to the food cold chain, such as IBM's FoodTrust and Alibaba's Food Trust Frameworks. This system is expected to guarantee food traceability and sustainability. In this research, we focused on the importance of maritime and aviation transportation in the entire supply chain, and we established the BCT-based beef cold chain system, which includes the reefer chain. Specifically, we raised the monitoring and physical infrastructure issues at the port (or airport) and maritime (aviation) transportation node and took these into consideration. Additionally, we conducted scenario analysis to investigate the effects of the suggested system. The amount of food losses and the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are calculated by different scenarios in accordance with the recall recovery time and node where a recall occurrence is recognized. For both import and export models, when the proposed BCT-based beef cold chain platform is applied, the number of discarded reefer containers and the associated GHG emissions go down by 42.1\% and 21.8\%, respectively. Interestingly, when we assumed the recall recognition stage was right after the defects occur, the largest effects of improving performance of the proposed platform were 48.3\% in import (IM) node of the port level. These results will provide a needed solution for cold chain management at the government level and affirms the essential role of the port/airport in the cold chain.

TI  - Evaluation of offshore CO2 transport alternatives in Brazil
AB  - As a more mature option, or with less apparent technological challenges, CO2 transport has deserved less scientific attention than its capture. However, there are relevant challenges to transportation, especially when it involves an irregular supply of CO2, for example, associated with the burning of seasonally available bioenergy, and the need to move offshore gas over long distances. This work evaluates the costs of implementing a CO2 transport infrastructure on the Brazilian coast, through a comparative analysis between offshore pipelines and ships. Seven routes were selected connecting ports to mature oil fields, for which abatement costs were estimated. Findings show that, for greater distances and smaller volumes (usually above 400 km and below 10 Mtpa), ships are more cost-effective, while in the case of larger volumes and small distances, offshore pipelines are the most suitable alternative. Moreover, ships adapt easily to variations in CO2 injection rates and market changes and can benefit from a multipurpose fleet associated with Liquefied Petroleum Gas transport. Â© 2022

TI  - Energy-use strategy of mangrove individuals along the life history
AB  - Mangroves, a unique flora, have high primary productivity in the intertidal environÃ‚ments. Mangrove species are more efficient in energy use than most of forest species when facing the harsh conditions, e.g., waterlogging, high salinity, and tidal flushing. How to balance the energy allocation among propagation, survival, stress-resilience and competition is the key driver for their successful settlement. From seedlings to mature plants, the main energy investment objects shift from roots to stems. Although the relative biomass of leaf decreases with plant growth, the calorific value in leaf is constantly higher than other organs. Due to the additional energy consumption for environmental resistance, the slow-return investments of energy-use stratAÃªgy are favored by most species. Under this situation, the investment to leaf is reduced, and the newly absorbed energy is concentrated on roots and stems to maintain the survival. Viviparous mangrove species invest more energy to propagules, while non-viviparous species have higher specific leaf area and nitrogen concentration but lower cost of construction, leading to faster investment return. The energy-use strategy is closely related to leaf economic spectrum, while both are important to the adaptive strategy and invasiveness of mangrove species under stressful environment.

TI  - Performance and design recommendations for on-site wastewater treatment using constructed wetlands
AB  - Constructed wetland technology is currently evolving into an acceptable, low-maintenance, and cost competitive alternative for small-scale and on-site wastewater treatment. Design criteria, however, have not been standardized and thus continue to limit the use of this promising alternative. In cooperation with the Alabama Department of Public Health, nine onsite constructed wetland systems were installed in coastal south Alabama and monitored for a period of one year. Specific objectives of the project were to (1) determine performance, reliability, and economic feasibility of constructed wetland technology and (2) demonstrate this new and innovative technology to the local community. Results indicate that excellent treatment performance for fecal coliform, BOD, and suspended solids can be achieved using constructed wetland systems. Fecal coliform, BOD, and suspended solids removal of up to 90\% were obtained. Significant nitrogen removal can be achieved, but requires design modifications or larger systems area. Design recommendations include (I)the use of two stages-one for treatment and one for disposal, (2) the use of a first-order BOD removal equation adjusted for temperature, and (3) the use of actual soil conditions to size a disposal area.

TI  - Ultra-High conductivity umbilicals: Polymer nanotube umbilicals
AB  - This document describes the work performed and scheduled to satisfy the terms of the Research Partnership to Secure Energy for America (RPSEA) contract number 10121-4302-01. NanoRidge, Inc., located in Houston, Texas, is the prime contractor and has subcontracted Rice University and DUCO, Inc. to participate in this endeavor. Representatives from Shell, Weatherford, Total, and Technip Umbilicals, the project's cost share partners, comprise the Steering Committee and Working Project Group. The ultimate goal and culmination of work is to use a carbon nanotube wire as the conductor in a prototype power cable umbilical. Once accomplished, the technology, starting at a technology readiness level (TRL) of 1, would have a TRL of 5 to 6. The project was instituted to replace copper wire with a carbon-based conductor. The difficulties with copper include a) corrosion, particularly at wire terminations, and b) strength, in some applications the weight of copper exceeds its tenacity. The conductor formed in this effort shall overcome these difficulties. The technical steps to achieve this goal are the continuous production of CNT wire with in-line post processing steps to form the bare conductor. The resistivity of the carbon nanotube wire shall be equal to copper at one sixth the weight. Once the conductivity is achieved, the wire shall be jacketed with polymer. This material we have termed the polymer nanotube umbilical (PNUÂ®) cable. Since the wire is nonmetal, we anticipate minimal saltwater corrosion. Also, the CNT conductor shall have greater tensile strength than copper. The following is described in this paper: 1) our technical approach and progress, 2) specialty equipment, and 3) Phase I and II results.

TI  - Control of large-scale impacts by designed structural damping
AB  - Modification of deep-water floaters often involves module installation using a floating crane vessel. The impact forces caused by relative motions between the floating vessels represent a major challenge during set down on the floater deck due to the large inherent variability of these forces. Traditionally the difficulties in predicting impact forces during module installation have been overcome by the use of experienced based rules of thumb rather than accurate simulations and calculations. One has to some degree relied on the indeed present but un-quantifiable effect of human intelligence of the operation supervisor. Traditionally the impact forces are taken either by elastic deformation of the module itself and/or the installation guides or by permanent deformation of intermediate structural elements through e.g. plastic yielding of ductile metal members or crushing of wood members. Designing the module and the guides to be able to take the entire probable range of impact forces is difficult due to the inherent contradiction between wanted flexibility and required strength. The large uncertainties of the impact energy imply that it is difficult to design these intermediate elements to cover all possible impact energy levels. Furthermore, these elements cannot be applied in cases where repeated impacts may occur. An attractive alternative to the traditional solutions is application of industrial shock absorbers. The performance of these is predictable and they can be designed to cover the estimated range of impact energy. This paper will present a more precise and consistent design and analyses methodology that gives a more accurate measure on the reliability of the operation in accordance with code requirements. The paper will show application of industrial shock absorbers as an alternative to traditional solutions for impact handling during offshore module installation to floating vessels, illustrated with experience gained by the installation of two modules on the Visund Semi. Results from multi-body simulations and model tests comparing traditional methods with the proposed solution will be given. The significant benefits obtained with respect to increased operational performance, reduced acceleration loads on the installed equipment, the increased predictability of the operation, and the consistent safety level in accordance with code requirements, will be highlighted. The possibility to apply designed damping for other offshore applications like dropped object protection etc, is also discussed.

TI  - Proper selection of LDHI for gas-condensate systems, in the presence of corrosion inhibitors
AB  - A number of gas fields have been developed in the Middle East, Offshore Western Australia and in the Asia-Pacific region for the last five years as the demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) has grown tremendously worldwide. Most of these gas field production systems consist of long subsea flowlines, which are flowing with three phase fluids gas, condensate and water. The cold temperatures of the subsea environment pose a flow assurance risk to production, especially for hydrate blockages. The only solution currently being considered to address the risk for hydrate blockages in gas fields is the usage of Kinetic Hydrate Inhibitors (KHIs), not Anti-Agglomerate Low Dose Hydrate Inhibitors (AAHIs). The most significant production concern for all producers associated with this production scenario is that the performance of the KHI is compromised in the presence of the Corrosion Inhibitor (CI). The reason for not considering the AAHIs for this application, whose performance is not compromised by the corrosion inhibitor, is the general belief that these chemistries are predominantly water soluble and therefore increase the toxicity of the produced water. The published literature to-date is focused on understanding the interactions between the KHI and the CI chemistries to solve the incompatibility issue. The lack of literature to-date showcasing the success of such an understanding warrants a solution with a different perspective. Data is available for new generation chemistries currently being used in the industry that show greater than 99% oil solubility and would hence overcome the toxicity concern that was valid for the first generation AAHI chemistry. This new generation chemistry was tested by Heriot-Watt University in the United Kingdom (UK) that shows the product effectiveness up to 90% water cut at a reasonable subcooling, applicable for these subsea flowlines in discussion. The performance at these high water cuts will make this new generation chemistry more applicable for these subsea flowlines without the risk of hydrate blockages.

TI  - An efficient solar-wind-diesel-battery hybrid power system for st. martin island of Bangladesh
AB  - St. Martin's island is a small island in the Bay of Bengal about 17 km far from the main land of Bangladesh. Nearly 6000 inhabitants live there and fishing is their primary livelihood and as a tourist spot there are many hotels and rest houses. Since the island is far away from the main landgrid connection is almost impossible even in future due to its geographical position. However, the electricity demand is partly fulfilled by stand-alone diesel generators. In this study, an attempt has been made to model a hybrid electricity generation system for a small community of the island. This system incorporates a combination of solar PV, wind turbine, battery and diesel generator. HOMER, software for optimization of renewable based hybrid systems, has been used to find out the best technically viable renewable based energy efficient system for 100 households and 10 shops. Sensitivity analysis is also done to see the impact of solar insolation, PV investment cost, wind speed and diesel fuel price on the optimum result. This system can reduce CO2 emission by about14 tons per year compared to diesel generator only.

TI  - Evidence for conservative transport of dissolved organic carbon in major river basins in the Gulf of Maine Watershed
AB  - Transport and fate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rivers are important aspects of the carbon cycle and the critical linkage between terrestrial, aquatic, and marine systems. Recent studies have quantified fluvial export to the marine environment in many systems, but in-stream losses of DOC are poorly constrained. This study compares DOC yields (kg C/ha) between the area-weighted averages of several tributaries within larger watersheds with the DOC yields of the larger watersheds to gain insight on in-stream losses in larger river systems. Four large watersheds, 22 tributaries to those watersheds, and 5 additional main stem locations in Maine were studied during 1 April to 15 November in 2011 through 2013. There were no significant differences in the area-weighted average DOC yield of the tributaries and the larger watersheds indicating little net in-stream loss in the main stems of the larger rivers. It is unlikely that inputs of DOC from un-gauged areas compensated for losses from gauged tributaries based on similarity in DOC yield longitudinally along the main stems of two of the rivers. In addition, wetland abundance, which is associated with higher DOC yield in this environment, did not consistently increase from tributaries to the larger watershed or longitudinally along the main stems. This geographic distribution of wetlands therefore also indicates that it is unlikely that inputs of DOC from un-gauged areas compensated for losses from gauged tributaries. These findings suggest that in-stream losses of DOC in these larger river systems are minimal and that the vast majority of DOC in major rivers in Maine is transported conservatively to the coastal ocean.

TI  - Sustainable energy for the marine sector
AB  - Most scientists agree that climate change is affected by anthropogenic factors, and measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are being considered among countries. The maritime transportation sector must bear its share of responsibility for adopting corrective innovative measures on a global scale. The authors projected the energy consumption and emissions of different marine transportation types in 2050 and applied the model of stabilization wedges to explore activities and technologies to deduce policies that would lead to sustainable marine propulsion. Three percent of the global emissions reductions -about 44GtCO 2/y- required to stabilize the temperature under 2Â°C above current levels must come from the maritime sector. To meet a reduction target of this segment, about 1.67GtCO 2/y in 2050, we propose a range of technologies that include mission refinement, resistance reduction, prime mover and propulsion innovation, and new fuels. The authors find that the goal is partially attainable and proposes the balance to be delivered by dedicated land-based synfuel refineries that use carbon dioxide from coal power plants and hydrogen produced from sustainable sources, an approach that would extend the lifecycle of conventional prime movers. We await the adoption of suitable technologies to reduce the emissions in the maritime sector. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The innovative part of proposed energy harvester is the introduction of control system into structure of tuned mass damper providing the automatic adjustment of springstiffness coefficient in accordance to the current frequency of external force. Such energy harvesting devices are targeting two issues: reduction of impacts of dynamic loads acting on vessel and obtaining additional portion of electrical energy for free.

ACRM can reduce CO2 and brine leakage, minimize interactions with neighboring subsurface activities, allowing independent assessment and permitting, reduce the Area of Review and required duration of post-injection monitoring, and reduce cost and risk. ACRM provides benefits to reservoir management at the cost of extracting brine. The added cost must be offset by the added benefits to the storage operation and/or by creating new, valuable uses that can reduce the total added cost. Actual net cost is expected to be site specific, requiring detailed analysis that is beyond the scope of this paper, which focuses on the benefits to reservoir management. We investigate operational strategies for achieving an effective tradeoff between pressure relief/improved-injectivity and delayed CO2 breakthrough at brine producers. For vertical wells, an injection-only strategy is compared to a pressure-management strategy with brine production from a double-ring 9-spot pattern. Brine production allows injection to be steadily ramped up while staying within the pressure-buildup target, while injection-only requires a gradual ramp-down. Injector/producer horizontal-well pairs were analyzed for a range of well spacings, storage-formation thickness and area, level and dipping formations, and for homogeneous and heterogeneous permeability. When the producer is downdip of the injector, the combined influence of buoyancy and heterogeneity can delay CO2 breakthrough. Both vertical and horizontal wells can achieve pressure relief and improved CO2 injectivity, while delaying CO2 breakthrough. Pressure buildup and CO2 breakthrough are sensitive to storage-formation permeability and insensitive to all other hydrologic parameters except caprock-seal permeability, which only affects pressure buildup for injection-only cases.

TI  - Environmental Controls on the Distribution of Tidal Wetland Soil Organic Carbon in the Continental United States
AB  - Tidal wetlands are among the most valuable ecosystems in the world in terms of ecosystem service value, and the strategic management of their carbon resources is an important part of climate change mitigation. Tidal wetland soils contain relatively high quantities of soil organic carbon (SOC); yet there is little information about whether this SOC can be predicted based on easily identifiable environmental factors. We investigated how tidal wetland SOC density was distributed across the continental United States among various coastal locations, estuarine typologies, vegetation types, water regimes, and management regimes and found that knowledge of a wetland's coastal affiliation provided the most differentiation (whether on the East Coast, West Coast, or Gulf Coast). We then sought to identify whether SOC density was correlated with 47 different environmental variables and found that knowledge based on latitude and precipitation explained ~46% of the variance in SOC density for wetlands on the West Coast and Gulf Coast, respectively. Several other geographic, oceanic, terrestrial, and atmospheric factors were cross-correlated along these axes, including oceanic salinity, temperature, and average catchment elevation. For the U.S. East Coast, SOC density was not simple to explain and was likely dependent on a wide range of interacting and complex factors. This synthetic work can provide a better understanding of how changing environmental and social conditions can lead to enhanced or degraded carbon sequestration rates in times of rapid global change.

TI  - Developing technologies for offshore oil and gas structures in frontier and hazardous areas
AB  - Much of the United States' future domestic petroleum supply is expected to come from the areas off the shore of Alaska and the lower 48 states. Areas of highest potential are in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), seismically active areas off southern California, and the ice-infested waters of the Arctic. Major technologies that have been or are currently being developed to open the deep ocean and Arctic to offshore oil and gas operations are highlighted. Various platform designs for deep-water drilling are described. Designs for use in the Arctic, which must include provisions for very low temperatures, sea ice, permafrost, seismicity, waves, and bottom scouring by ice ridges are examined. Provisions for earthquake hazards are considered.

TI  - Effective EEDI performance achievement by MAN B and W G-Type ultra long stroke marine diesel engine: A review
AB  - Man Diesel &amp; Turbo G-Type ultra long stroke marine diesel engine was introduced in October 2010.This ultra long stroke means it has been designed to have reduced engine speeds and there by achieving high efficiency ships with reduced fuel consumption as well as reduced CO2 emissions. The ultra long stroke diesel engine with capability of using large size propeller and there by engines with comparatively low speeds can be used for propulsions of large bulk carriers and oil tankers. This arrangement facilitates the effective implementation of EEDI. In this paper we review the effectiveness of this engine in implementation and achievement of EEDI and thereby achieving reduced CO2 emissions. In this paper, we also study the selection of propeller sizes to achieve the optimum design ship speeds and thereby comply with EEDI requirements. Â© 2017.

TI  - Design and fabrication of the Auger deck
AB  - The Auger deck structure, covering an area approximately 300 feet by 300 feet, is an open truss design that provides support for nine major modules and numerous equipment skids that are required for drilling and production operations. The design of the deck was accomplished in four distinct cycles that increased in sophistication as the design requirements matured. The concept cycle allowed for the efficient evaluation of major system configuration alternatives. The preliminary cycle provided realistic weight estimates of alternative truss configurations in the deck. Once the final configuration was set, the design and analysis cycle was utilized to develop construction drawings. The final cycle was during the early construction phase to adapt the design to the contractors capabilities and fabrication plans. The deck was fabricated and assembled by McDermott Inc. at their facilities in Amelia, Louisiana. The primary trusses, assembled from prefabricated nodes and girders, along with other prefabricated subcomponents, were constructed in buildings, transported to the erection site and assembled to form the complete deck. Major modules and other equipment skids that were provided by Shell Offshore Inc. were integrated into the structure as the structural components were erected. The deck contract specified that the contractor establish and maintain a Quality System documented in a formalized Quality Manual and Quality Plan. The Quality System was patterned after the requirements of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9002. This was the first time Shell Offshore Inc. entered into a major fabrication contract with the contractor performing the primary quality control and assurance functions. The Auger deck was a very complex structure to design and fabricate due to its wide range of functional requirements, the novel systems and strict weight budget requirements. Designers, field staff and the contractor worked continuously to improve the design and construction methods to improve productivity and schedule without sacrificing quality.

TI  - Ship of the future â€“ A slender dry-bulker with wind assisted propulsion
AB  - From the first days of our civilization sea transport has enabled trades. Today sea transport accounts for 80% of the Global trade measured in ton miles and 3% of Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. More than 40% of this sea trade is performed by the Dry bulkers, making them the real workhorses of the sea. Compared to other transport modes, Sea transport and Dry bulkers in particular, are energy efficient. Despite this, with the urgent need to reduce Global GHG emissions according to the Paris agreement (UNFCCC 2015), all sectors including shipping, needs to deliver major GHG reduction within the next decades. This paper focus on potential energy reductions through building more slender bulk vessels in combination with wind assisted propulsion (WASP). The results indicates that fuel consumption and hence GHG emissions can be reduced by up to 40% on an operational basis (EEOI) and 30% when shipbuilding is included (LCA). Â© 2022

TI  - The mangrove mesocosm of Biosphere 2: Design, establishment and preliminary results
AB  - Biosphere 2 is a specially constructed, 1.25 ha, greenhouse in southern Arizona, USA that is atmospherically and materially isolated from Biosphere 1, the Earth. Housed inside are living recreations of five natural ecosystems and an agricultural zone. Techniques were developed for the transplantation, maintenance and establishment of a diverse neotropical estuarine ecosystem model (referred to here as the mangrove mesocosm). Technical systems were designed for the simulation and control of environmental conditions including rain (0-3 l s(-1)), wind (0-11 km h(-1)), air (5-50 degrees C) and water temperature (15-35 degrees C), water circulation (0-20 l s(-1)), salinity (0-45 ppt), relative humidity (10-85\% RH) and nutrient removal (up to 20 g-N d(-1)). In or near the mangrove mesocosm permanent sensors monitored and recorded at 15-min intervals the following ranges: light above (5-35.5 E m(-2) d(-1) and 1600 mu E m(-2) s(-1) maximum) and below (0.5-5 E m(-2) d(-1)) the mangrove canopy; air(18-42 degrees C) and water(16-27 degrees C) temperature; salinity (25-35 ppt); relative humidity (50-80\% RH); pH (7.6-8.1); dissolved oxygen (3.8-5.5 mg l(-1)); and several biogenic gasses including oxygen (20.5-14.5 ppm), CO, (500-4500 ppm), methane (0-50 ppm), nitrous oxide (0-80 ppm) and hydrogen sulfide (0-0.1 ppm). From November 1990 to December 1993, mangrove height increased approximately 250\% for each of the three mangrove species: Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove). The: spreading mangrove average canopy area increased by 374, 533 and 637\% for the red, black and white mangroves, respectively. The mangroves organized into a closed canopy, maturing forest under the unique set of conditions found inside of Biosphere 2. Concurrent litterfall and decomposition monitoring experiments were initiated in October 1992 in the mesocosm and at Florida-based analog research sites. Reproductive litterfall and total litterfall approximated the seasonal patterns found at the field sites. Both total and reproductivelitterfall production in the mesocosm exceeded field levels (except for white mangrove) but fall within reported rates for Southwest Florida. Total litterfall and total reproductive litterfall for the mesocosm red (1281.1 g m(-2) yr(-1); 178.3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and black (635.2 g m(-2) yr(-1); 64.6 g m(-2) yr(-1)) mangroves exceed the Florida field site red (948.3 g m(-2) yr(-1); 89.2 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and black (461.7 g m(-2) yr(-1); 16.3 g m(-2) yr(-1)) mangrove rates. The field white mangrove total litterfall and total reproductive litterfall (766.3 g m(-2) yr(-1); 215.9 g m(-2) yr(-1)) rates were greater than that produced by the mesocosm white mangroves (654.8 g m(-2) yr(-1); 67.6 g m(-2) yr(-1)). In addition to being a useful system for mangrove ecology, the mesocosm is on display for public education and awareness of the need to conserve wetland areas.

TI  - Offshore well construction with closed-loop cementing technology
AB  - Achieving successful isolation of potential flow zones during well construction from floating rigs has historically been a formidable task, particularly on HPHT prospects. Operational challenges include actual vs. predicted leak-off test (LOT) values, margins of error in mud weights, high temperature compressibility at shoe depth and risk of inducing a fracture during pre-flush and/or cement slurry displacement. Wellbore strengthening operations may contribute to the relative unknown. Additionally, it is often assumed that the weakest component of the cementing operation is the last casing shoe, which may not be the case. This presentation speaks to conducting dynamic formation integrity tests when drilling the open hole to be cased and cemented and applying managed pressure drilling (MPD) techniques as a means of increasing chances of getting a good cement job on the first attempt and in keeping with the intent of API Recommended Practice 65, Part 2- Isolating potential flow zones during well construction: Preparatory - quantify the stability of the wellbore, actual wellbore pressures data for correlation with cementing simulator models & more efficient hole cleaning ahead of the cement. Displacement - optimize fluid dynamics, ascertain in real-time an induced fracture and/or help ensure the column of plug in the tubing string is balanced with the annulus. Curing -maintain more consistent annulus pressure on rigs experiencing wave heave & backpressure applications for minimizing the risk of channeling. Testing - using MPD kit in lieu of cementing equipment or exercising the BOP. Copyright Â© (2013) by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Organic Carbon Cycling in Continental Margin Environments
AB  - Intense carbon cycling in coastal ecosystems is driven by a complex mixture of physical and biogeochemical processes that vary spatially and temporally in response to local forcing and geomorphology. The impact of ocean boundaries on the global carbon budget is not well known but likely provides major pathways for transferring carbon among the important, climatically relevant reservoirs. With the caveat that significant uncertainty remains in the estimates of many of the important carbon transfers, results to date imply that 21% of global primary production, a likely higher proportion of the export production, a significant proportion of the net oceanic uptake of CO2, and nearly half of the biological pump transfer of carbon to the deep sea reservoir occur at the ocean boundaries, driven by coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Streamline simulation of CO2 storage in saline aquifers
AB  - Injecting CO2 in deep saline aquifers is one of many feasible options for mitigating climate change in the medium term. It is important, though, to evaluate the risk involved. Numerical simulations of CO2 injection may be performed to assess the likely migration paths. However, since aquifers may be extensive and highly heterogeneous, the time taken for conventional finite-difference simulations may be prohibitive. In this study, we investigated the application of streamline simulations as a means for speeding up simulations of CO2 injection. The simulations were carried out using a model that was constructed to represent a "generic" heterogeneous deep saline aquifer, using the geometry of the Tay Aquifer near the Forties Field in the North Sea. The main advantage of streamline simulation is its ability to process high-resolution grids efficiently and, in recent years, there has been a widespread increase in the use of streamline simulation in modelling oil reservoirs. The first part of this paper describes a sensitivity study on several streamline-specific parameters to examine their impact on the simulation of CO2 storage in saline aquifers. The differences between streamline and compositional models were then examined. The comparison between the streamline and compositional simulations was carried out for two different injection strategies, designated as follows: â€¢ Scenario 1 - Injection of supercritical CO2 â€¢ Scenario 2 - Injection of CO2 saturated brine The results of the sensitivity analysis on the streamline parameters and the comparisons between the streamline and compositional models were analysed and contrasted. In particular, we found that in Scenario 1, where gravity effects are important, there were significant differences between the streamline and conventional simulation results. The streamline simulation produced a more diffuse plume. However, in Scenario 2, where density of the injected fluid was similar to the resident fluid, the simulation results were similar.

TI  - INVESTIGATION OF WASTE HEAT ENERGY IN A MARINE ENGINE WITH TRANSCRITICAL ORGANIC RANKINE CYCLE
AB  - The increasing of fuel prices and global energy demand and enactment of new restrictive emissions regulations require more efficient and environmentally friendly engines to be designed. In this context, conversion of waste heat to useful energy is necessary to design more energy efficient vessel including using more efficient main engines and auxiliary engines. The aim of this study, thermodynamic characteristic of recovery of a ship's main engine waste heat is determined parametrically for waste heat recovery system (WHRS). Naturally, heat exchangers are used for waste heat recovery. Because of that reason, firstly shell and tube heat exchanger will be investigated parametrically. In order to make a more accurate calculation, it is important to reflect the pressure and enthalpy variations in the heat exchanger to the heat transfer calculations. After that the Transcritical Organic Rankine Cycle (TORC), which is recommended by many authors for the recovery of waste heat sources at low and medium temperatures, will be examined parametrically. The results show that increasing the number of pipes in the heat exchanger at a certain value may result in a decrease in system performance parameters that is The Net Power and Thermal Efficiency due to decreasing velocity of the mass flow in tubes. Moreover, The Net Power and Thermal Efficiency curves behaved differently with variable mass flow rate. Therefore, we will define performance parameter being important for WHRS.

TI  - Efficiency Analysis of Shipboard DC Power Systems
AB  - Growing concerns about environmental protection and oil prices have forced the transport industries to develop low emission, fuel efficient solutions. In the maritime sector, dc grids are being considered for commercial marine vessels to improve emission and fuel consumption. As a requirement for evaluation and optimization of the fuel consumption, this paper sets forth efficiency modeling and analysis of a shipboard dc power system. The studied dc hybrid power system includes diesel engines, synchronous generator-rectifier units, and a full-bridge bidirectional converter that incorporates an energy storage device into the system. Various loss components of different elements are analyzed in detail, which are finally simplified to be readily used in complex optimization algorithms.

TI  - Core-scale geophysical and hydromechanical analysis of seabed sediments affected by CO2 venting
AB  - Safe offshore Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) includes monitoring of the subseafloor, to identify and assess potential CO2 leaks from the geological reservoir through seal bypass structures. We simulated CO2leaking through shallow marine sediments of the North Sea, using two gravity core samples from -1 and -2.1 m below seafloor. Both samples were subjected to brine- CO2 flow-through, with continuous monitoring of their transport, elastic and mechanical properties, using electrical resistivity, permeability, P-wave velocity and attenuation, and axial strains. We used the collected geophysical data to calibrate a resistivity-saturation model based on Archie?s law extended for clay content, and a rock physics for the elastic properties. The P-wave attributes detected the presence of CO2 in the sediment, but failed in providing accurate estimates of the CO2 saturation. Our results estimate porosities of 0.44 and 0.54, a background permeability of -10-15 and -1017 m2, and maximum CO2 saturation of 18 \% and 10 \% (?5 \%), for the sandier (shallower) and muddier (deeper) sample, respectively. The finer-grained sample likely suffered some degree of gas-induced fracturing, exhibiting an effective CO2 permeability increase sharper than the coarser-grained sample. Our core-scale multidisciplinary experiment contributes to improve the general interpretation of shallow sub-seafloor gas distribution and migration patterns.

TI  - Experimental Study of Wellbore Integrity for CO2 Geological Storage
AB  - Storing CO2 into a suitable underground geological formation is considered the most effective way for a safe and definitive CO2 sequestration. Depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs are potential sites for injection and permanent CO2 storage. The wells drilled which have been duly plugged and abandoned constitute one of the main risks directly affecting permanent and safe CO2 storage, due to possible material deterioration around the wellbore, including the durability of the cement. Therefore, deep abandoned wells represent the greatest risk for potential leakage pathways along the wellbore's structure. Accordingly, a new experimental procedure is proposed here to improve our understanding of reactivity of CO2-brine-well cement systems. For the experimental tests, API Class G cement samples were prepared by following the same industrial cementing process conditions used in the depleted Goldeneye gas condensate reservoir (North Sea). The analysis further shows variations of permeability with confining pressure and depth. The permeability increases with depth, from 2.06 x 10-21 m2 (at 1296 m depth) to 1.17 x 10-20 m2 (at 2560 m depth). Â© 2017 The Authors.
