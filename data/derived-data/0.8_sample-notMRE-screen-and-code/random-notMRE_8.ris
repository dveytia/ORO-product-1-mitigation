TI  - Environmental Filtering by pH and Salinity Jointly Drives Prokaryotic Community Assembly in Coastal Wetland Sediments
AB  - Understanding the microbial community assembly is an essential topic in microbial ecology. Coastal wetlands are an important blue carbon sink, where microbes play a key role in biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and energy transformation. However, the drivers controlling the distribution patterns and assembly of bacterial and archaeal communities in coastal wetland are unclear. Here we examined the diversity, co-occurrence network, assembly processes and environmental drivers of bacterial and archaeal communities from inshore to offshore sediments by the sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The value of alpha- and beta-diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities generally did not change significantly (P > 0.05) between offshore sites, but changed significantly (P < 0.05) among inshore sites. Sediment pH and salinity showed significant effects on the diversity and keystone taxa of bacterial and archaeal communities. The bacterial and archaeal co-occurrence networks were inextricably linked with pH and salinity to formed the large network nodes, suggesting that they were the key factors to drive the prokaryotic community. We also identified that heterogeneous and homogeneous selection drove the bacterial and archaeal community assembly, while the two selections became weaker from offshore sites to inshore sites, suggesting that deterministic processes were more important in offshore sites. Overall, these results suggested that the environmental filtering of pH and salinity jointly governed the assembly of prokaryotic community in offshore sediments. This study advances our understanding of microbial community assembly in coastal wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Renewable resource management with stock externalities: Coastal aquifers and submarine groundwater discharge
AB  - We model coastal groundwater management and its effects on submarine groundwater discharge, nearshore marine water quality, and marine biota. Incorporating the stock externality effects on nearshore resources increases the optimal sustainable steady-state levels of both the aquifer head and the stock of a keystone native algae species. Numerical simulations are illustrated using data from the Kuki'o region on the Island of Hawaii. Two different approaches for incorporating the nearshore resource are examined. Including algae's market value in the objective function results in only slightly lower rates of groundwater extraction. When a minimum constraint is placed on the stock of the keystone species, however, greater conservation may be indicated. The constraint also results in non-monotonic paths of water extraction, head level, and marginal opportunity cost of water in the optimal solution. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monitoring and research on environmental impacts related to marine natural gas hydrates: Review and future perspective
AB  - In response to the accelerating processes of marine natural gas hydrate exploration and gas production from hydrate-bearing sediments, their potential impacts on the environment have been attracting extensive attention from international academia as well as from industry, especially in recent years. Methane seeps related to gas hydrate degradation on the seafloor are ubiquitous on continental slopes in both active and passive continental margins. A previous series of articles suggest that hydrate dissociation (gas release or ebullition at large scale) mainly occurs as a result of faulting or decreased lithostatic pressure triggered by many external driving forces (mainly including tectonic activities, overpressure zone, earthquake and fides), and temperature change. These frequently affect methane inputs into the atmosphere, fueling seafloor oxygen consumption or ocean acidification, and even posing submarine geohazards. Gas hydrate-related areas are usually estimated from indirect biochemical indications (cold-seep communities, element and isotopic anomalies in pore water) and geophysical indications (surface morphology, gas plumes and pathways). Therefore, appropriate application of monitoring and detection methods is of crucial significance for assessing the temporal and spatial variability of related environmental indicators in gas hydrate reservoirs. Monitoring is also as an essential support for harvesting this potential alternative energy in ways that are safer, more economical, and more environmentally friendly. Following the three structural elements of a hydrocarbon seep pumping system (gas/fluid source, fluid migration pathway, and seeping structures at or near the seafloor), this paper sets forth the significance of indicators for dynamics resulting from the destabilization of reservoirs of natural gas hydrates, reviews the corresponding monitoring or detection methods and integrated monitoring systems; and especially, expatiates the in situ observation networks regarding gas hydrate reservoirs and gas hydrate production tests. In the closing section, we discuss and draw conclusions regarding the challenges for future development of hydrate environmental monitoring and significant environmental issues requiring special attention. We intend this paper to provide references and to set the scene for future research activities about gas hydrates, so as to ignite the interest of more research groups around the world.

TI  - Could a new Scottish CO2 transport and storage industry deliver employment multiplier and other wider economy benefits to the UK economy?
AB  - In 2021, the UK Government commenced a `cluster sequencing' initiative to identify early movers in delivering carbon transport and storage (T\&S) services to proximate regional industry clusters with capture potential. A Scottish proposition focussed primarily on linking the Grangemouth industry cluster to North Sea storage, and the potential to transition Oil and Gas industry capacity to deliver CO2 T\&S has devolved policy support. This is in terms of potential to transition and create new direct industry and supply chain jobs, set against risks of displacing jobs in different sectors and regions of the UK. We introduce a Scottish CO2 T\&S industry to a UK multi-sector economy-wide model, assessing the extent of potential expansion and job creation in the presence of supply-side and funding constraints. We find that large employment `multiplier' gains registered in previous studies only apply over the very long term and in the absence of such constraints. Crucially, any need to recover demands on the public purse via socialisation of costs severely constrains possible gains, while imposing `polluter pays' leads to net economy-wide contractions triggered by competitiveness losses concentrated in Scottish cluster industries, leading to offshoring of production and jobs, potentially skewed within the localities hosting the clusters.

TI  - Challenges in offshore natural gas processing
AB  - The Brazilian offshore pre-salt cluster is one of the most important recent discoveries of hydrocarbon resources in the world. These fields normally present high CO2 content (more than 10%) and also high Gas Oil Ratio (GOR), thus might limit the oil production in the convention FPSOs project due to the capacity and complexity of gas processing plant. These conditions lead to application of alternative processes for gas treatment in offshore environment, such as molecular sieve for dehydration, fixed bed for H2S removal and CO2 removal membranes. Besides, due to high flow and high pressure drop involved in the treatment section, an increase in the number of equipment, such as compressors, heat exchangers and scrubbers are needed in order to reach high pressure values necessary for the CO2 reinjection into production zones for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). proposes. This objective will also contribute to increase complexity on the gas processing plant since it must deal with expected variations in GOR and CO2 content in natural gas during field lifetime. Petrobras and partners have been working, since 2008, with the objective to increase performance of existing processing and compression technologies and also supporting application of new ones (technological gaps) that can result in overall improvements in CAPEX and OPEX, such as: nano-sized zeolites for dehydration, new metal oxides for H2S removal with high capacity under influence of CO2, new material for membranes (ceramic and carbon tubes) and dense phase CO2 separation. The aim of the combined use of such iniatives is footprint and weight reduction, higher efficiency, less energy consumption with modular design. The purpose of this paper is to present the actual strategy for developing offshore gas process in Brazil, emphasizing the different technological gaps identified and the consequential road maps that are being pursued for the new units to be designed.

TI  - China's deepwater gas hydrate development strategies under the goal of carbon peak [ç¢³è¾¾å³°ç›®æ ‡ä¸‹ä¸­å›½æ·±æµ·å¤©ç„¶æ°”æ°´åˆç‰©å¼€å‘æˆ˜ç•¥]
AB  - Developing marine gas hydrate (hereinafter referred to as hydrate) in a large scale is one of China's major strategies for energy development. In order to determine China's strategies to deepwater hydrate under the goal of carbon peak, this paper classifies its development technologies into five types, i.e., laboratory simulation test technology, geological exploration technology, drilling and sampling technology, three-gas commingled production technology and environmental risk monitoring technology, according to the clustering analysis results of the papers and patents related to hydrate. In addition, hydrate development status and deepwater hydrate development direction are studied systematically. And the following research results are obtained. First, marine hydrate production technologies have the double attributes of great significance and great difficulty and they have strategic and revolutionary characteristics in the nation level and prospective and competitive features in the technical level. Second, the large-scale hydrate development in the sea areas of China still faces several theoretical and technologies difficulties. For example, the temporal and spatial evolution of reservoir heat, fluid, mechanics, space, structure and multiple fields are not understood clearly, the complex gas-liquid-sand-hydrate four-phase flow law from reservoir and wellbore to underwater Christmas tree, submarine pipeline and downstream process facility is not clarified, and the regeneration mechanism of hydrate is not recognized. Third, as for the development of deepwater shallow hydrate, high-accuracy detection technology and stereoscopic and comprehensive detection technology of geophysics, geology, logging and drilling are the main development directions in the future. Fourth, the hydrate resource evaluation method is on the way to be refined, the development mode and production test engineering of hydrate resource tend to the joint development of hydrate and oil & gas, and new commingled production technology and equipment will be the hot spot and frontier direction of following research. Furthermore, China's deepwater hydrate development path and the development theories and technology roadmap in 2020-2035 are put forward. In conclusion, the future development strategies of deepwater hydrate focus on exploring and breaking through the safe and efficient production technologies of surface, shallow and deep hydrate of different types and different occurrence forms. What's more, for different development modes of deepwater hydrate, it is in urgent need to establish a comprehensive monitoring and systematical evaluation mechanism from local to entire and from short term to long term, so as to ensure the stable production test and large-scale development of hydrate.

TI  - Mass balance of nitrogen in constructed mangrove wetlands receiving ammonium-rich wastewater: Effects of tidal regime and carbon supply
AB  - A series of computer-controlled mangrove tide-tanks planted with Kandelia candel was constructed to investigate the removal and transformation of ammonium-nitrogen under two tidal regimes: (i) 12-h wet/12-h dry (long tidal regime) and (ii) 6-h wet/6-h dry/6-h wet/6-h dry daily (short tidal regime). All tanks were irrigated with NH4Cl solution for nine water cycles (each cycle lasted for 5 weeks) at an amount of around 2.1 g NH4Cl (equivalent to 0.52 g N) per tank per cycle. During the experiment, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), inorganic nitrogen (N) (NH4+-, NO2--, and NO3--N) and carbon were completely removed by the mangrove system. The added NH4+-N was not detected in tidal water or accumulated in sediment. The mass balance of nitrogen showed that the discharge of ammonium-rich wastewater to mangrove wetlands enhanced microbial nitrogen transformation, particularly nitrification and denitrification processes, with 15-30% of the total nitrogen inputs returned to atmosphere as N2 gas. Growth of K. candel and macroalgae was stimulated by ammonium addition, and up to 3 and 7% of total N inputs were assimilated in plant and algal tissues, respectively. Constructed mangrove wetlands with short tidal regime had higher numbers of nitrifiers and significantly lower content of ammonium that those with long tidal regime. On the other hand, higher populations of denitrifiers and lower nitrate were found in mangroves with long tidal regime and with glucose addition. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vortex induced motions and surge/sway oscillation periods of the independence hub and thunder Hawk Semi-submersibles
AB  - The Independence Hub semi-submersible and Thunder Hawk semi-submersible, both located in the Gulf of Mexico, have been operational since 2007 and 2009 respectively. The underwater hull geometry is basically the same for both vessels. Both Independence Hub and Thunder Hawk are moored by twelve polyester mooring lines. Independence Hub supports many more flowlines than Thunder Hawk. Each semi-submersible is equipped with a measuring system which records, amongst other data, the semi-submersible's position, and the current speed and direction. The measurements indicate that Vortex Induced Motion (VIM) behavior occurs, and VIM behavior occurs under increased current velocities. However, observed VIM amplitudes are much smaller than what is observed under typical model test conditions and there is a significant variation in oscillation period. Yet and evaluation of oscillation periods between Independence Hub, Thunder Hawk and model tests reveals very similar characteristics when normalizing the periods by the natural period in surge/sway. The determination of the surge/sway natural period for field conditions is not as straightforward; different natural period in surge/sway have been observed for the same vessel under different historical conditions. The natural period in surge/sway for those field conditions was identified through an iterative procedure. The important aspect of the procedure is that at lock-in 1) the variation in natural period in surge/sway is minimal, 2) that the motions are nearly sinusoidal, and 3) the motion amplitudes are the largest observed. The Independence Hub and Thunder Hawk field observations indicate that the frequency (response period) behavior of a semi-submersible in the field is rather well duplicated by the traditional model test setup, though significant differences exist regarding the magnitude of response. The field measurements contain information for reduced velocities up to approximately eleven; hence lock-in and post lock-in conditions are included.

TI  - The CFD design and optimisation of a 100 kW hydrogen fuelled mGT
AB  - Against the background of a growing deployment of renewable electricity production, like wind and solar, the demand for energy storage will only increase. One of the most promising ways to cover the medium to long-term storage is to use the excess electricity to produce hydrogen via electrolysis. In a modern energy grid, filled with intermittent power sources and everincreasing problems to construct large power plants in densely populated areas, a network of Decentralised Energy Systems (DES) seems more logical. Therefore, the importance of research into the design of a small to medium-sized hydrogen fuelled micro Gas Turbine (mGT) unit for efficient, local heat and electricity production becomes apparent. To be able to compete with Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines (RICEs), the mGT needs to reach 40 % electrical efficiency. To do so, there are two main challenges; the design of an ultra-low NOX hydrogen combustor and a high Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT) radial turbine. In this paper, we report on the progress of our work towards that goal. First, an improvement of the initial single-nozzle swirler (swozzle) combustor geometry was abandoned in favour of a full CFD (steady RANS) design and optimisation of a micromix type combustion chamber, due to its advantages towards NOx-emission reduction. Second, a full CFD design and optimisation of the compressor and turbine is performed. The improved micromix combustor geometry resulted in a NOx level reduction of more than 1 order of magnitude compared to our previous swozzle design (from 1400 ppm to 250 ppm). Moreover, several design parameters, such as the position and diameter of the hydrogen injection nozzle and the Air Guiding Panel (AGP) height, have been optimized to improve the flow patterns. Next to the combustion chamber, CFD simulations of the compressor and turbine matched the 1D performance calculations and reached the desired performance goals. A CFD analysis of the impact of the tip gap and exhaust diffuser cone angle led to a choice of these parameters that improved the compressor and turbine performance with a limited loss in efficiency.

TI  - Relevance of carbon burial and storage in two contrasting blue carbon ecosystems of a north-east Pacific coastal lagoon
AB  - Coastal vegetated ecosystems constitute very productive habitats, characterized by efficient Corg sequestration and long-term preservation in sediments, so they play an important role in climate change mitigation. The temporal evolution of Corg content, stocks and burial rates were evaluated in seagrass and salt marsh habitats in San Quintin Bay (northeast Pacific, Mexico)by using 210Pb-dated sediment cores. Salt marsh cores were characterized by fine-grained sediments, higher salinities, lower terrigenous input and lower mass accumulation rates (MAR: 0.01â€“0.03 g cmâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1)than seagrass cores (MAR: 0.02â€“3.21 g cmâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1). Accumulation rates in both habitats steadily increased throughout the past century most likely because of soil erosion promoted by land use changes in the surroundings. The Corg stocks were highest in salt marsh cores (12.2â€“53.6 Mg haâˆ’1 at 10 cm depth; 259â€“320 Mg haâˆ’1 at 1 m depth)than in seagrass cores (5.7â€“14.4 Mg haâˆ’1, and 80â€“98, Mg haâˆ’1, respectively), whereas Corg burial rates were considerably lower in salt marsh (13â€“60 g mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1)than in seagrass (9â€“144 g mâˆ’2 yrâˆ’1)habitats, and the temporal variations observed in Corg burial rates were mostly driven by changes in the accumulation rates. The overall Corg stock (485 Â± 51 Gg C)for both habitats together was comparable to the carbon emissions of a major city nearby. Our results highlight the need to protect these environments as relevant carbon reservoirs. Â© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Oceanic iron fertilization: one of strategies for sequestration atmospheric CO2
AB  - Carbon cycle is connected with the most important environmental issue of Global Change. As one of the major carbon reservoirs, oceans play an important part in the carbon cycle. In recent years, iron seems to give us a good news that oceanic iron fertilization could stimulate biological productivity as CO2 sink of human-produced CO2. Oceanic iron fertilization experiments have verified that adding iron into high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) seawaters can increase phytoplankton production and export organic carbon, and hence increase carbon sink of anthropogenic CO2, to reduce global warming. In sixty days, the export organic carbon could reach 10 000 times for adding iron by model prediction and in situ experiment, i.e. the atmospheric CO2 uptake and inorganic carbon drawdown in upper seawaters also have the same magnitude. Therefore, oceanic iron fertilization is one of the strategies for increasing carbon sink of anthropogenic CO2. The paper is focused on the iron fertilization, especially in situ ocean iron experiments in order that the future research is more efficient.

TI  - Making better business decisions evaluating multi-prospect plays using a clustered development basis
AB  - In plays with multiple prospects, decision makers put themselves at a significant disadvantage by using economics on a stand-alone basis to justify development for each prospect. Offshore developments do not require a stand-alone discovery to exceed a minimum economic threshold for the development to be sanctioned. Technology developments such as, extended reach drilling and long distance subsea tie-backs support the development of an asset area using a "clustered" development model. The presence of geologic dependence and development synergies between prospects, requires that business development decisions be made holistically using a "clustered" development approach. In the clustered development approach, the geologic dependence between prospects is combined with the aggregation of prospects to determine the economic viability of a grass roots development offshore. Historically our industry has applied a rather straightforward conservative approach whereby a grass roots development required a single prospect to meet or exceed the minimum economic threshold. A better approach would base the initial sanctioning and capacity design decisions on one or more discoveries that exceed the minimum economic threshold in aggregate, even though no individual discovery may be large enough to support a stand-alone development. Although easily visualized, economic evaluations of clustered developments do not typically consider the geological dependencies and development synergies that exist. As we will demonstrate, modeling these synergies has a significant impact on the economic evaluation of grass roots developments. Play analysis concepts, where we develop an understanding of the dependency between prospects, must be assessed to properly evaluate new offshore developments. In "greenfield developments", there are geologic chance dependencies (shared chance elements) between many of the prospects. Probabilistic analysis is the preferred method to evaluate the range of possible resource outcomes at each prospect and the dependency between the shared chance parameters of the clustered prospects. These geologic dependencies, integrated with development dependencies, will be linked to modify the probabilistic geologic resources distribution into an economic resources distribution and economic chance of project success. Examples will be shown in this paper of a clustered development economic evaluation that quantifies the increased chance-weighted resources, improved chance of economic success for project sanctioning and the increased expected monetary value of the venture.

TI  - Highly efficient solar seawater desalination with environmentally friendly hierarchical porous carbons derived from halogen-containing polymers
AB  - Desalination of seawater using solar energy is a promising solution to the global freshwater shortage. Ultrahigh surface area (up to 1740 m(2) g(-1)) hierarchical porous carbons (HPC) have been prepared by the carbonization of precursors derived from the room temperature dehalogenation of low cost, widely available polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with simple, low cost, environmentally friendly processes. The broad hierarchical pores (from 2 nm to 20 mu m) facilitate and ensure fast water and vapor transportation. Flexible photothermal steam generation devices were successfully fabricated with these hierarchical porous carbons on hydrophilic ultrathin (200 mu m) paper. An evaporation rate record of 7.87 kg m(-2) h(-1) and high energy conversion of 95.8\% have been obtained under the concentrated solar intensity of 5 kW m(-2). Our research leads to a new approach to converting halogenated plastics into environmentally friendly and useful porous carbon materials by simple, low-cost processes. It establishes and validates the concept of creating a sustainable and economic pathway to simultaneously recycle halogenated polymers, harvest solar energy and produce clean freshwater.

TI  - Offshore: Research aimed at mapping inexhaustible supply of energy in gulf
AB  - The semi-submersible Uncle John recently embarked on a 30-day voyage in the Gulf of Mexico to map a virtually inexhaustible supply of energy - the methane hydrate that may represent â‰¤ 200,000 tcf of natural gas. The expedition marks the next major step in understanding a potentially huge energy resource trapped in methane hydrate, called the "ice that burn" because it releases a flammable gas when it melts. The resource is found far beneath the surface in waters along the US coast and the permafrost of Alaska. DOE funded the Gulf of Mexico Joint Industry Project, a 4 yr, $13.6 million, cost-shared effort to develop technologies that locate and safely drill through or near the hydrate. While the potential of methane hydrates as an energy source is enormous, researchers must continue to study its characteristics, evaluate drilling safety issues, and weigh its effect on global climate change, while finding ways to cost-effectively transport the gas to the surface before wide-scale production can occur.

TI  - Ship-Based Carbon Capture and Storage: A Supply Chain Feasibility Study
AB  - The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) calls for the maritime industry to restrict its CO2 emissions by âˆ’40% (IMO2030) and âˆ’70% (IMO2050). This paper answered the following research question: â€œWhich technical, economic and emissions-related conditions predominantly determine the feasibility of a conceptual supply chain of liquid CO2 that is captured from the exhaust gases of LNG powered offshore vessels?â€ The captured CO2 is transported to land where it is utilized by a final customer. The study followed a systems engineering approach. Problem definition was followed by a requirements analysis (technology, emissions, economy and operations), design with scenarios and a case study with realistic vessel deployment, modeling and evaluation. All designs have technical uncertainties and financial risks, but the sale of captured CO2 could be a crucial advantage of the proposed concept over other concepts. The main conclusion is that emission and financial targets (payback time) can be met by aligning the offshore transportation distance with the capacity to store CO2 on board and the available means of transport to the final user. Specialists from the vessel owner indicate that capturing, storage and off-loading is likely to have minor implications for the vessel availability and regular operations. Â© 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Effect of dynamic loading on wellbore leakage for the Wabamun Area CO2 sequestration project
AB  - To permanently remove CO2 from the atmosphere large scale injection of CO2 from stationary sources such as coal fired power plant and heavy oil production into brine filled formation is seen as one of the most viable options. One of the main risks identified with storing CO 2 into the subsurface is the potential for leakage through existing wells penetrating the cap rock. The wellbore system has several components which can fail and create leakage paths such as type and placement of wellbore casing and cements, completion method, abandonment and wellbore expansion or contraction by changes in temperature and pressure. Of the 1000 wells in the study area near Lake Wabamun, Alberta 95 wells penetrated the immediate cap rock above the proposed Nisku injection formation and was identified as potential leakage pathways. The leakage risk of these wells was evaluated based on the knowledge of well design, current well status and historical regulation's in the area. For the subset of 27 well studied on only 4 wells were identified as wells requiring work over which was less of a problem than anticipated. To evaluate the risk of creating leakage paths by thermal and pressure changes caused by CO2 injection, a three dimensional finite-element model was built which used elasto-plastic material models for cement and formation. Multi-stage simulations for casing-cement and cement-formation interactions with temperature enabled elements were conducted. Because of the uncertainty on cement properties in old wells, a parametric study of cement properties was conducted. The simulation results indicated that thermal cooling might reduce near-wellbore stresses which will increase risk of integrity loss in casing-cement and cement-formation. The parametric study reviled that the risk of debonding and tensile failure will increase with increasing Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the cement under dynamic loading conditions. In addition, low mechanical cement strength will increase risk of shear failure in the cement. Copyright 2011, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - OXYFLUX, an innovative wave-driven device for the oxygenation of deep layers in coastal areas: A physical investigation
AB  - Coastal areas for anthropic zones are vital economic hubs for tourism, fisheries and recreational activities. These are just some of the businesses which develop and grow many parts of the world. In terms of water quality, the growth of economy, along with the acceleration of climate change makes it necessary for sustainable coastal defense plans. No other environmental variable of such ecological importance to estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems around the world has changed so drastically, in such a short period of time, as dissolved oxygen in coastal waters. This paper specifically addresses the use of a new floating device called OXYFLUX, (devoid of electro-mechanical sections), as an innovative approach to altering water quality parameters with the aim of increasing the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the underwater areas near the bottom. This is based on laboratory results. The experiments were carried out on a device in 1:16 scale in wave flume at University of Bologna.OXYFLUX's functionality is based on floater's capacity to collect incoming waves into a reservoir that floats on the sea surface. Collected water yields a higher hydraulic head in the reservoir, which in turn induces a downward water flux inside the device body. The dynamic response of the device, and it's pumping capacity are assessed under a variety of wave conditions by changing wave steepness. Experiments allow a first outline of design recommendations for these kinds of devices. At the end of the paper such guidelines are applied to Northern Adriatic coast conditions.

TI  - Widened safe mud window for subsalt well sections: A workflow and case study
AB  - This paper presents a 3D numerical study on the mechanical behaviors of natural fracture under injection loading, and further proposes a practical workflow for designing a widened safe mud weight window (MWW) for drilling subsalt well sections with natural fractures. The original safe MWW value for subsalt well sections is usually narrow. More specific, for a subsalt well section with natural fractures, no safe MWW existed because of this unfavorable geological environment. Therefore, hydraulic plug technology was adopted to reinforce wellbore stability and widen the MWW. The value for opening a natural fracture under the given mud-weight pressure was numerically calculated, and then used for selecting the lost circulation material (LCM) treatment size. In addition, stress cage, which is quantified by enhancement of hoop stress at the wellbore surface, was numerically analyzed. An illustrative example is performed with information from a well in a deepwater Gulf of Mexico (GOM) field. It is observed that a fracture with initial width of 0.5 mm opening to 0.664 mm will result in an increment of 0.55 lbm/gal mud weight. This solution is obtained with assumption of one pair of natural fractures. In the case of two existing pairs of fractures, a 1.1 lbm/gal increment of mud weight can be directly obtained for this set because of the linear property of the model,. The case study described in this paper provides a workflow for widening the MWW for safe drilling through a naturally fractured subsalt well section. A best practice for using this type of MWW design is also presented.

In this paper, we show that the vessel features of a future deep seabed mining vessel have many similarities to offshore vessels in the deep-sea offshore oil and gas industry and can be used as such. We evaluate and discuss the technical, operational, and commercial performance of three possible vessel design solutions developed based on such a case ship. Â© IMDC 2022. All right reserved.

TI  - Sequestering seawater on land: A water-based solution to global issues [version 1; referees: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]
AB  - The 'surplus' of oceanic water generated by climate change offers an unprecedented opportunity to tackle a number of global issues through a very pragmatic process: shifting the excess water from the oceans onto the land. Here we propose that sea-level rise could be mitigated through the desalination of very large amounts of seawater in massive desalination plants. To efficiently mitigate sea-level rise, desalinized water could be stored on land in the form of crop, wetlands or new forests. Based on a US$ 500 million price to build an individual mega desalination plant with current technology, the cost of controlling current sea-level rise through water desalination approaches US$ 23 trillion. However, the economic, environmental and health benefits would also be immense and could contribute to addressing a number of global issues including sea-level rise, food security, biodiversity loss and climate change. Because these issues are intimately intertwined, responses should aim at addressing them all concurrently and at global scale. Â© 2016 Boyer S and Lefort MC.

TI  - Emerging technical challenges of 5-million-ton/yr injections
AB  - To achieve substantial national and global greenhouse gas abatement, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) must be deployed at large scale in many locations. Individual large projects (5 million tons/y) will inject volumes on the order of 80,000-130,000 bbls/day equivalent continuously for 30 years or more. This requires explicit consideration of and management of growing reservoir pressure unlike CO2-EOR. Accurate reservoir descriptions of fault networks and the in-situ stress tensor are critical to successful management. Small uncertainties in the structural geometry or stress tensor azimuth can potentially produce very different results for fault activation and risk, which in turn affect the potential for induced seismicity in an active injection. Although smaller than the injection pressure wave, the large injection footprint will make monitoring and verification challenging. Key challenges involve reduction of cost and improvement of accuracy using non-seismic methods. Careful integration of monitoring results and understanding of uncertainties are critical to avoid subsurface trespass and far-field migration. Demonstrations of InSAR, microseismic, and electrical survey methods have improved understanding of these technologies and may lead to improved monitoring suites. Seafloor monitoring has received little attention, but will be central to shelf deployments. Direct monitoring of groundwater systems may also be required by regulations, but have received little attention. In order to avoid excessive local build-up of pressure and to maintain a small injection footprint, active management of the reservoir may be needed. Co-production and treatment of reservoir brines could provide a cost-effective means of reducing both operational risk and project costs. More aggressive reservoir management (interception wells and induced flow fields) may be needed to avoid trespass onto adjacent properties. Such measures are standard practice in many oilfield operations, suggesting that the incremental cost and risk posed by active management is likely to be small.

TI  - Integrated Water Resources Management in Coastal Regions and Wastewater Reuse in Alexandria, Southern Mediterranean
AB  - A study has been conducted to develop wetland eco-systems and cost-effective alternatives to the discharge of Alexandria's partially treated wastewater into coastal lagoons, lakes and to provide sustainable solutions for wastewater recycling. A pilot wetland facility, in conjunction with a biofilm aeration facility, was constructed at Lake Maryout by Alexandria coast, where primary treated wastewater of 50,000 m(3)/day is being handled. The satisfactory results of water quality parameters of the pilot wetland effluent were compared with the performance of the wastewater-natural treatment facility located at Arcata Bay, CA. The results provide motivations for further large scale wetland applications in the available land of Maryout Valley where fresh water supplies are low. Highlights are presented on use of safe wastewater sludge and bio-solids for restoration of constructed and natural wetlands, which serve for coastal defense; e.g. at the Nile Rosetta headland, San Francisco Bay, and the Central Wetlands in Louisiana, USA.

TI  - Quantification of near-bed dense layers and implications for seafloor structures: New insights into the most hazardous aspects of turbidity currents
AB  - Turbidity currents pose a serious hazard to expensive oil and gas seafloor installations, especially in deep-water where mitigation, re-routing or repair is costly and logistically challenging. These sediment-laden flows are hazardous because they can be exceptionally powerful (up to 20 m/s), and can flow for long distances (>100s km) over several days duration, causing damage over vast areas of seafloor. Even less powerful flows (âˆ¼1-2 m/s) can damage seafloor equipment, or break strategically important submarine telecommunication cables. The consequences of turbidity currents impacting seafloor structures depends on the velocity, duration, direction of impact and, perhaps most crucially, the sediment concentration (or density) of the flow. While some recent studies have successfully monitored turbidity currents in deep-water, imaging flow properties close to the seafloor has proven problematic. We present innovative approaches to the quantification of the velocity and sediment concentration of dense near-bed layers that provide new insights into this important aspect of turbidity current flow. Firstly, we describe a novel experimental setup that is capable of measuring near-bed sediment concentration in dense (>10% volume by concentration) flows. Density contrasts are measured using Electrical Resistivity Tomography - a technique initially developed for geophysical characterisation of subsurface reservoirs. Velocity is measured using Ultrasonic Doppler Velocity Profiling and concentration is characterized using an Ultra High Concentration Meter. Secondly, we outline some recently developed geophysical approaches for the quantification of sediment concentration and velocity for real-world flows based on recent work in fjords, estuaries and deep-sea canyons. This includes integrated moored deployments of Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers, Multibeam Sonars, and a novel Chirp array. We outline some limitations and advantages of these methods. Finally, we underline the value and importance of establishing multiple field-scale test sites in a variety of settings, including deep-water, that will enhance the industry's understanding of turbidity current hazards. Our results demonstrate the importance of near-bed dense layers for turbidity current interaction with seafloor structures. Density contrasts and pressure build up at the base of a flow may lead to uplift, undermining and loss of support, dragging, or pipeline rupture; hence quantification of this layer is crucial for hazard assessment. Measurements of sediment concentration within turbidity currents are incredibly rare, and yet are a vital input for any numerical model that aims to predict sediment transport by turbidity currents in deep-water settings. Currently it is necessary to infer densities and velocities; however, such inferences are poorly calibrated against experimental or real world data. Our measurements underline the importance of understanding near-bed dense layers. Copyright 2015, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Effective concepts for supplying energy to a large offshore oil and gas area under different future scenarios
AB  - Different possibilities were assessed to supply energy to a large offshore oil and gas area in the North Sea. The concepts studied involved: (i) onsite power generation by means of simple gas turbine cycles, (ii) full electrification of the plants with power taken from the onshore grid, and (iii) a hybrid solution where power can be either generated onsite or taken from the onshore grid. The analysis included 37 y of the facilities' lifetime and was based on process simulations of the various concepts. The effect of the offshore area electrification was simulated through a model of the power system. The integration of process and power system modelling contributes to the originality and completeness of the analysis. The environmental impact of the concepts was evaluated in terms of cumulative CO2 emissions. The relative economic cost was also assessed to provide a complete picture. The results showed that the advantage of a specific concept over the others was significantly influenced by the future energy policies and the magnitude of the initial investment cost.

TI  - A thermoelectric cap for seafloor hydrothermal vents
AB  - Long-term in situ monitoring is crucial to seafloor scientific investigations. One of the challenges of operating sensors in seabed is the lifespan of the sensors. Such sensors are commonly powered by batteries when other alternatives, such as tidal or solar energy, are unavailable. However, the batteries have a limited lifespan and must be recharged or replaced periodically, which is costly and impractical. A thermoelectric cap, which harvests the thermal energy of hydrothermal fluids through a conduction pipe and converts the heat to electrical energy by using thermoelectric generators, was developed to avoid these inconveniences. The thermoelectric cap was combined with a power and temperature measurement system that enables the thermoelectric cap to power a light-emitting diode lamp, an electronic load (60 Î©), and 16 thermocouples continuously. The thermoelectric cap was field tested at a shallow hydrothermal vent site near Kueishantao islet, which is located offshore of northeastern Taiwan. By using the thermal gradient between hydrothermal fluids and seawater, the thermoelectric cap obtained a sustained power of 0.2-0.5 W during the field test. The thermoelectric cap successfully powered the 16 thermocouples and recorded the temperature of the hydrothermal fluids during the entire field test. Our results show that the thermal energy of hydrothermal fluids can be an alternative renewable power source for oceanographic research. Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Multiple benthic indicators suggest low sewage impact from an ocean outfall in a high-energy sandy shore (South Brazil)
AB  - Increasing urbanization in coastal areas has not paralleled with adequate sewage treatment, and the overload of organic matter compromise important economic, ecological and social values supported by these ecosystems. Ocean outfalls may be an effective alternative to the destination of wastewater in coastal regions, provided they are properly installed and monitored. In this study, we investigated the effects of a small outfall on a high-energy sandy shore, southern Brazil, using sedimentary steroids, biochemical composition and nutritional quality of organic matter and free-living nematode biodiversity as indicators. The results showed that physical disturbances prevail near the outfall, affecting the densities of the fauna and phytopigments. The higher concentrations of sedimentary sterols detected at 1000 m NE from the outfall indicated the influence of the local hydrodynamic conditions in the transport and dispersion process of the sewage. In this area, the sewage contamination changed the benthic trophic state from oligotrophic to eutrophic, and lead to a strong decrease in the trophic diversity and increase of opportunistic nematode genera. Overall the results showed a relatively low and limited spatial impact from the outfall. The integrated use of fecal sterols, benthic trophic state and nematodes biodiversity were highly effective in detecting sewage contamination of low input of wastewater in a highenergy sandy shore.

TI  - Possibility for CO2 Sequestration Using Sea Water
AB  - In view of the abundant calcium and magnesium ions in sea water, an approach to CO2 capture and sequestration is put forward through enhancing the alkalinity of sea water and increasing the partial pressure of CO2. The purpose of these measures is to increase the concentration of carbonate ion and then accelerate the formation of carbonate precipitation, such as CaCO3 and MgCO3. With the increase of pH, some non-target product, e. g. Mg(OH)(2), may emerge and precipitate from sea water system, so there is a top limit which is found to be pH=9.25 in order to avoid this problem. Considering that it takes a long time for surface ocean water to absorb atmospheric CO2, the engineered process may accelerate the natural kinetics to industrial rates if sea water is applied to scrub flue gas. Through calculation, it is found that applying alkalinity-enhanced sea water to accelerate the formation of carbonate precipitation is a potential and promising method to capture and sequester CO2. In actual application, condensed sea water from desalination plant or high concentration brine can be introduced to react with waste CO2. Additionally, if these carbonate precipitation could be separated, the natural carbonate resources, such as limestone, would be saved to some degree.

TI  - Changes of vegetation carbon storage in Yancheng coastal wetlands for six periods
AB  - This study estimated the vegetation carbon storage in 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002 2007 and 2012 analyzed the characteristics the temporal variation and discussed its influence on carbon fixation of the whole ecosystem based on the land cover data of various landscape patterns with 5 year temporal stage and vegetation carbon density data calculated and collected from references. The results showed that vegetation carbon storage in Yancheng coastal wetlands had kept increasing, with a net increase of 6.56Ã—1051 and 0.26Ã—l05 t/a on average. Ratios of carbon storage of native species (Aeluropus sinensis, Phragmites australis and Suaeda salsa) had been dropping, while ratio of carbon storage of the alien invasive species (Spartina alterniflora) showed an obvious increase, and the ratio of carbon storage of farmland had been increased slightly. Reclamation and alien invasions were the two most important reasons which resulted to the temporal variation of vegetation carbon storage in Yancheng coastal wetlands. The paper suggested that the effective and sustainable carbon fixation depended on both the natural law of salt marsh evolution and the exploitation rate of reclamation in Yancheng coastal wetlands.

TI  - Multi-criteria analyses of two solvent and one low-temperature concepts for acid gas removal from natural gas
AB  - This paper evaluates three acid gas removal concepts studied in the project "A Green Sea". Two solvent concepts (aMDEA/MDEA and Selexol) and a low-temperature concept are modelled and assessed, taking different raw natural gases and natural gas product requirements into consideration. The analyses and comparisons of the concepts and cases consider nine criteria in order to include both energy efficiencies and compactness.The assessment shows that acid gas removal using aMDEA/MDEA technology seems to perform well in terms of energy efficiency, volume and weight for low CO2 removal. However, for high CO2 content or strong polishing requirements, the chemical solvent technology loses its efficiency in terms of weight and volume. The assessment shows that the Selexol concept is an inefficient option in terms of energy efficiency, volume and weight, especially when large quantities of CO2 have to be removed from the gas stream. The assessment also shows that the low-temperature technology can be a compact and energy-efficient option, both in the case of strong polishing requirements and high bulk removal of CO2. However, the higher the amount of CO2 to be removed, the less energy efficient is the low-temperature technology.The case evaluation underlines the fact that the aMDEA/MDEA solvent concept exhibits the best or close to the best key performance indicators (KPIs) for all parameters for the RNG1Pipe case (raw natural gas specification 1 to pipeline quality specification) and therefore appears to be the best technology option. For this case, the two other technologies are slightly less energy efficient than the aMDEA/MDEA, but both are significantly less compact. For the RNG1 LNG (raw natural gas specification 1 to LNG quality specification) case, the aMDEA/MDEA and low-temperature concepts have similar KPIs. The chemical solvent technology, however, is slightly more energy efficient and compact and would therefore be preferred for the RNG1 LNG case. Finally, the RNG2 Pipe (raw natural gas specification 2 to pipeline quality specification) case shows that the low-temperature technology can be a compact option for acid gas removal, which is a critical factor in the case of offshore applications for both the equipment costs and the weight constraints on the platform. Despite its lower energy efficiency, it is therefore likely that the low-temperature technology will be selected in the RNG2 Pipe case. This choice is strengthened by some regulations which recommend that solvents such as MDEA and aMDEA should be phased out for offshore applications, as is seen, e.g. in Norway. In addition, if stricter regulations are also enforced for onshore applications, this might also argue in favour of the low-temperature technology or other chemical solvents that are otherwise less efficient than aMDEA/MDEA.Finally, the potential of hybrid concepts is discussed and suggested for future works, in order to combine the advantages of the different technologies, such as the energy-efficient performances of the aMDEA/MDEA concept and the compactness of the low-temperature concept.

TI  - Permeable bio-reactive barriers to address petroleum hydrocarbon contamination at subantarctic Macquarie Island
AB  - A reliance on diesel generated power and a history of imperfect fuel management have created a legacy of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination at subantarctic Macquarie Island. Increasing environmental awareness and advances in contaminant characterisation and remediation technology have fostered an impetus to reduce the environmental risk associated with legacy sites. A funnel and gate permeable bio-reactive barrier (PRB) was installed in 2014 to address the migration of Special Antarctic Blend diesel from a spill that occurred in 2002, as well as older spills and residual contaminants in the soil at the Main Power House. The PRB gate comprised of granular activated carbon and natural clinoptilolite zeolite. Petroleum hydrocarbons migrating in the soil water were successfully captured on the reactive materials, with concentrations at the outflow of the barrier recorded as being below reporting limits. The nutrient and iron concentrations delivered to the barrier demonstrated high temporal variability with significant iron precipitation observed across the bed. The surface of the granular activated carbon was largely free from cell attachment while natural zeolite demonstrated patchy biofilm formation after 15 months following PRB installation. This study illustrates the importance of informed material selection at field scale to ensure that adsorption and biodegradation processes are utilised to manage the environmental risk associated with petroleum hydrocarbon spills. This study reports the first installation of a permeable bio-reactive barrier in the subantarctic. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - An Innovative variable layout steam plant for waste heat recovery from marine dual-fuel engines
AB  - The paper describes an original Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) variable layout plant to produce steam from the exhaustgases of marine dual-fuel engines. A large part of the steam feeds an electric turbogenerator to improve the ship's energy efficiency.The layout of the proposed steam plant is conceived in a double configuration to satisfy both the stack temperature constraints of theengine exhaust gas, due to the use of diesel oil (no less than 160 degrees C as outlet gas temperature) or natural gas (there are no particularstack temperature limits). The comparison with a traditional WHR single pressure steam plant shows the potential benefits of thevariable configuration. Indeed, the proposed solution allows a better exploitation of the potential thermal energy of the natural gas,without precluding a proper performance even in diesel mode, with a moderate weight increase compared to a single pressure WHR system.

TI  - Evaluation of Sediment Diversion Design Attributes and Their Impact on the Capture Efficiency
AB  - Many riverine systems have been disconnected from their receiving basins by flood-protection levees and other engineered systems. Reconnecting these alluvial rivers with their receiving basins is a viable option to nourish and sustain existing coastal wetland systems as well as to build new land. This sediment nourishment can be accomplished through direct dredging and placement or through sediment diversions. Efficient design of sediment diversions is important to maximize the land building potential. This study's objective is to quantitatively identify key design attributes of sediment diversions, influencing their ability to capture sediment. The outfall channel alignment angle (phi), intake invert elevation, and diversion size are hypothesized as key parameters. The analysis is limited to sediment grain sizes larger than 63 mu m and has been performed using a validated three-dimensional numerical model. A time integrated sediment-water ratio was used as an indicator to reflect efficiency of sediment capture. Analyses indicate phi has minor impact on total diverted sediment load and limited to the medium sand (M) fractions (250-500 mu m) compared to the fine (125-250 mu m) and very fine (63-125 mu m) size classes. The sediment water ratio increases as intake invert elevation is deepened to a certain limit, then it plateaus around y(Inv)/y(Bar) similar to 0.75, implying that deeper invert beyond that limit may not be beneficial. The analysis also shows that the sediment water ratio sharply increases up to a water discharge extraction ratio of 0.1 as the size of the diversion is increased, and plateaus around 0.2.

TI  - Significance of blue carbon in ecological aquaculture in the context of interrelated issues: A case study of Costa Rica
AB  - There is an increasing global awareness of the socioeconomic and ecological significance of coastal and marine ecosystems and aquaculture. Marine ecosystems have been substantially affected by unsustainable exploitation and abuse, leading to their degradation and decline in their capacity to provide ecosystems services. The focus of this chapter is on blue carbon stocks and their significance in coastal marine aquaculture. This chapter presents a holistic discussion of blue carbon and aquaculture, which touches upon multiple factors that are intricately linked, thus requiring elaboration of the complexity of the factors. In ecological aquaculture, stability of ecosystem is vitally important, and it is this stability which is threatened by aquaculture if carried out as an activity that is not consistent with the environmental thresholds. Many intensive aquaculture practices which disturbed the functional capacity of critical coastal ecosystem have failed to recognize the impacts of such activities on long-term food supply. Blue carbon is a term that has been coined to refer to carbon sequestration and storage in aquatic vegetation ecosystems. It is part of a trend in the sustainability literature that seeks to highlight the importance of ecosystem services in order to promote their conservation within diverse institutional alternatives to command and control policies. One of these alternatives is the global carbon market, which may provide financial incentives to protect and conserve natural ecosystems through the development of carbon offset projects. Specifically, blue carbon offset projects may provide additional incentives to protect and rehabilitate mangrove ecosystems in synchronization with aquaculture production. Aquaculture that is compatible with conservation of aquatic vegetation ecosystems is resilient and fares better in terms of sustainability. This not only helps aquaculture supply more aquatic food but also plays a responsible role towards fisheries and mitigating the effects of climate change. Given the fact that the topic of blue carbon is still in its nascent stage, there are a number of interrelated issues that need to be discussed to understand the key ingredients required to develop the linkages between blue carbon and aquaculture. An exclusive focus on blue carbon vis-Ã -vis aquaculture ignores the other related factors, resulting in a discussion that is not adequate in terms of its outcomes for integrated management of coastal marine resources for sustainable seafood supplies. This chapter, therefore, will distil the current science and implementation mechanisms of blue carbon projects and highlight their links with ecological aquaculture. The topic of blue carbon and aquaculture has not been discussed in scientific or grey literature, and this chapter intends to provide a novel approach that explains the synergies that may be achievable between blue carbon and ecological aquaculture through a case study in Costa Rica.

TI  - Weir building: A potential cost-effective method for reducing mercury leaching from abandoned mining tailings
AB  - To mitigate mercury (Hg) pollution and reduce Hg downstream transportation, a weir was designed by a river system that had been inflicted by leachate from the slagheap of the Yanwuping Hg mine in Wanshan Hgmining area. A whole yearmonitoring of Hg species was conducted, and the efficiency of Hg reduction by the weir application was evaluated. The Hg concentrations in the river waterwere significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season. Waterflow was confirmed to be the main driving factor for Hg mobilization and transportation, and an episode study revealed that most Hg was released in times of storms. Increased monitoring and preventive maintenance measures need to be taken on barriers in advance of storms. A large proportion of the total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) is associated to particles. During the study period, approximately 412 g THg and 4.04 g total MeHg (TMeHg) were released from the YMM slagheap, of which 167 g THg and 1.15 g TMeHg were retained by the weir. Annually, 40.4\% THg and 38.4\% TMeHg was retained by the weir. Weir construction is considered as a potential cost-effective measure tomitigate Hg in riverwater and should be promoted and extended in the future after optimization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Variability in the Carbon Storage of Seagrass Habitats and Its Implications for Global Estimates of Blue Carbon Ecosystem Service
AB  - The recent focus on carbon trading has intensified interest in 'Blue Carbon'-carbon sequestered by coastal vegetated ecosystems, particularly seagrasses. Most information on seagrass carbon storage is derived from studies of a single species, Posidonia oceanica, from the Mediterranean Sea. We surveyed 17 Australian seagrass habitats to assess the variability in their sedimentary organic carbon (Corg) stocks. The habitats encompassed 10 species, in mono-specific or mixed meadows, depositional to exposed habitats and temperate to tropical habitats. There was an 18-fold difference in the Corg stock (1.09-20.14 mg Corg cm-3 for a temperate Posidonia sinuosa and a temperate, estuarine P. australis meadow, respectively). Integrated over the top 25 cm of sediment, this equated to an areal stock of 262-4833 g Corg m-2. For some species, there was an effect of water depth on the Corg stocks, with greater stocks in deeper sites; no differences were found among sub-tidal and inter-tidal habitats. The estimated carbon storage in Australian seagrass ecosystems, taking into account inter-habitat variability, was 155 Mt. At a 2014-15 fixed carbon price of A$25.40 t-1 and an estimated market price of $35 t-1 in 2020, the Corg stock in the top 25 cm of seagrass habitats has a potential value of $AUD 3.9-5.4 bill. The estimates of annual Corg accumulation by Australian seagrasses ranged from 0.093 to 6.15 Mt, with a most probable estimate of 0.93 Mt y-1 (10.1 t. km-2 y-1). These estimates, while large, were one-third of those that would be calculated if inter-habitat variability in carbon stocks were not taken into account. We conclude that there is an urgent need for more information on the variability in seagrass carbon stock and accumulation rates, and the factors driving this variability, in order to improve global estimates of seagrass Blue Carbon storage.

TI  - Hydrostatic Response of Deployable Hyperbolic-Paraboloid Umbrellas as Coastal Armor
AB  - This paper introduces an innovative structural system consisting of four-sided hyperbolic-paraboloid (hypar) roof umbrellas as hard countermeasures against nearshore hazards. The umbrellas line the coast and remain upright during normal operation, providing shade and shelter along the waterfront while not limiting access to the shore. A hinge at the hypar-column interface permits tilting to form a physical barrier against surge-induced coastal inundation. Analytical equations based on idealized boundary conditions are formulated in the hydrostatic regime. The equations provide insight into optimal geometric parameters and are used to validate a decoupled numerical scheme constituting smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and the finite element method (FEM). All numerical reactions concur with the analytical solutions for water inundation matching the total deployed height. A proof-of-concept study was employed to successfully illustrate the applicability of deployable hypar umbrellas as coastal armor from a structural engineering perspective. This work ultimately demonstrates the feasibility of decoupled SPH-FEM methods in modeling fluid-structure interaction involving hypar forms, while establishing a foundation for their analysis and design for coastal hazard adaptation.

TI  - Relevance of mangroves for the production and deposition of organic matter along tropical continental margins
AB  - Mangroves are highly complex ecosystems occupying a major part of tropical coastlines. High primary productivity, efficient biological nutrient recyling and a permanent exchange with terrestrial and marine ecosystems are their common features. Despite the high production and export rates of leaf litter, mangrove detritus has been reported to be of minor importance in sustaining marine food webs. The geographical distribution of mangrove-derived organic matter (OM) in marine sediments is found to be restricted to the vicinity of its source. Dissolved nutrient inputs from mangroves and rivers may fuel the production of marine OM. In this paper we assess the relevance of mangroves for the production and sedimentation of OM in the tropical coastal ocean based on data available from the literature and our own research results. We estimate the rates of carbon accumulation in mangrove sediments and of carbon export to the coastal seas. From the rates of litter fall and export we calculate carbon accumulating in mangrove sediments to be in the order of 23x10(12) g C per year and mangrove carbon introduced into the coastal ocean to be in the order of 46x10(12) g C per year. They account for about 11\% of the total input of terrestrial carbon into the ocean and 15\% of the total carbon accumulating in modem marine sediments.

TI  - Tutorial: A century of sidewall coring evolution and challenges, from shallow land to deep water
AB  - Due to the high cost of conventional coring operations, rotary sidewall coring has become increasingly important, particularly for deepwater operations. The rig costs, operational challenges, and amount of time involved to core wells below 30,000 ft are considerable, even for wireline operations. As wells get deeper, formation pressures will exceed 30,000 psi, and differential pressures can exceed 10,000 psi, which will eclipse the capabilities of traditional rotary coring tools. New technology has been introduced to enhance the recovery of rotary sidewall cores to improve operations and capabilities on these challenging wells that will be the primary subject of this paper. This new technology can also enhance coring operations and reliability for land and other offshore operations, in addition to deep water. New improvements and challenges include: â€¢ Reliable 1.5-in.-diameter core samples, with a 35,000-psi-rated tool â€¢ New high-powered coring tools with enhanced energy to address cutting Lower Tertiary well-cemented formations (Wilcox, Lower Miocene, etc.) â€¢ Higher torque and horsepower at the bit to enhance cutting and prevent stalling when coring â€¢ High-powered surface systems along with high-strength and high-power wireline cables â€¢ Upgrades to address high temperatures, high-differential pressures, high-mud viscosity, large (24 in.) boreholes, and improved reliability â€¢ New drill bits and catcher rings to use a high-power system and operate in harsh coring environments â€¢ New cutting, retrieval, and core handling advancements for reliability in hard, consolidated formations â€¢ Combinability upgrades to reduce wireline trips and reduce rig costs for coring â€¢ Dual-coring tools with the ability to have different catcher rings and bits downhole simultaneously on a single run, along with tool redundancy downhole for improved reliability â€¢ A combination of rotary coring and formation sampling operations to obtain formation pressures, fluid samples, and rotary sidewall cores on a single run â€¢ Downhole monitoring of the coring operation, which includes drilling functions like torque, bit force, penetration rate, core bit penetration, and recovered core length, along with tool orientation â€¢ Core recovery information to enable 100% core verification downhole, so extra cores are not cut unnecessarily during the job, with individual core plugs measured and verified downhole â€¢ A unique method to seal the cores in a pressure-compensated coring tube downhole to capture all the formation fluids in the rock in downhole conditions â€¢ Complete rotary coring downhole operations can be monitored remotely for offsite interaction during the coring operation Besides reviewing historical coring tools and techniques, new technology is also discussed in more detail. The new technology starts with the introduction of the 1.5-in.-diameter rotary sidewall coring tools for deep water over a decade ago. Many applications and technologies are presented to show their effectiveness for deepwater operations. The successful examples include acquiring 1.5-in. cores in large boreholes, hard formations, deep wells, high-dififerential pressures, and extreme hydrostatic pressure. There are also examples of new technology available for future operations, including dual coring, combination coring, and sealed pressurized coring. Â© 2021 Society of Well Log Analystists Inc..

TI  - Design standard for concrete LNG terminals offshore
AB  - Investors and oil companies have lately shown an interest in concept development, design and construction of reinforced concrete structures in the marine environment. Examples of such concepts are fixed and floating concrete platform to be used as terminals for LNG/LPG. Based on this interest, DNV has developed an Offshore Standard for Classification of Concrete LNG Terminal. The DNV Offshore standard for " Offshore Concrete Structures" is based on the earlier Rules for Design of Concrete in the marine environment, i.e. the 1974 Rules, the 1977 Rules and the 1993 FOI Rules. The Offshore standard is further founded on the experience gained with the used of these standards and the durability of existing platforms built in the period after the installation of the first concrete platform at Ekofisk in 1973. The LNG containment is incorporating the requirements of IGC and EN1473 into the general design approach for offshore concrete structures. The DNV Offshore standard for offshore concrete structures can be used for material selection, design, construction supervision and in-service inspection of Offshore Concrete Structures of any type and with the new DNV-OS-C503 Offshore LNG/LPG terminals in concrete is also covered by a DNV Offshore Standard. The focus in this paper is directed toward LNG terminal due to the current need for a concrete standard associated with new terminal concepts. DNV Offshore Standard C502 " Offshore Concrete Structures" and DNV OS-C503 " Offshore Concrete LNG Terminals" will be issued in spring 2004 and can be applied for design, verification and classification of offshore Concrete Structures where DNV is acting as classification company or DNV is performing verification work for compliance with specific standard. The standard is considered to be of significant assistance to both the owner, the designer and the National Authorities (US Coast Guard) in quality assurance of the New Terminal Structures, as currently no comprehensive standard exist covering the design of these new innovative structures in concrete.

TI  - Onshore disposition of offshore oil and gas platforms: Western politics and inter-national standards
AB  - Onshore-only disposition of retired offshore oil and gas platforms has become a core strategic objective for ocean/environmental advocates and policy makers. Although international oil companies oppose an onshore-only requirement, its rejection is no longer a high priority for them. The ascendancy of onshore-only disposition reflects a rational and predictable response to political attitudes, values, and expectations in Western Europe by both governmental policy makers and petroleum industry strategists. Repercussions from the fight over the disposition of the obsolete Brent Spar offshore oil storage and transfer facility are the proximate cause of the shift. Onshore disposition has been least expensive option for most platforms, but as platforms move further from shore toward deeper waters onshore disposition is more frequently inferior to other disposition alternatives - from both an environmental and economic point of view. If onshore-only disposition were to become an international standard, either de facto or de jure, some offshore producing areas would incur significantly higher disposition costs and lose opportunities to better utilize and protect their marine resources.

TI  - Water quality improvement with artificial floating islands
AB  - As the natural purification of the traditional artificial floating island is very slow, the purpose of this research is to explore the efficiency of the green energy artificial floating island (GAFI) to improve water quality. We constructed experimental models near the bank of Lize Lake at MingDao University in Taiwan, where the surrounding waters and wastewater from the dormitories served as the sources for water purification and treatment. In the field of the experimental model, three water tanks, each of which is 165cm in depth and 130cm in diameter, with 2 tons of water in total, were buried as the experimental containers. The GAFI area is 60Ã—60cm equipped with three kinds of aquatic plants: Typha orientalis Presl, Eleocharis dulcis and Juncus effuses, as the vegetation purification plants, and an aerator device powered by solar power. According to our experimental results, GAFI can effectively break down stratified water into homogenized water and inhibit algae growth. The dissolved oxygen and oxygen reduction potential were increasing when the GAFI was used, and the NH3-N, NO3-N and NO2-N were effectively decreased. As GAFI can quickly enhance water quality, it is worth promoting its application for water landscapes and environmental conservation in the future. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Because the development of methane hydrates is of great interest for future energy of natural gas, a lot of R&D projects have been undertaken to achieve the whole system including geological survey, exploration, production and enhanced recovery technologies. Japanese program MH21 has promoted the own R&D, focused on the production of methane hydrates from offshore areas. In this talk, research and development related to gas hydrates production are summarized to reveal the status and updated technologies of its exploitation.

TI  - Simulation study of CO2 Huff-n-Puff in tight oil reservoirs considering molecular diffusion and adsorption
AB  - CO2 injection has great potentials to improve the oil production for the fractured tight oil reservoirs. However, Current works mainly focus on its operation processes; full examination of CO2 molecular diffusion and adsorption was still limited in the petroleum industry. To fill this gap, we proposed an efficient method to accurately and comprehensively evaluate the efficiency of CO2-EOR process. We first calculated the confined fluid properties with the nanopore effects. Subsequently, a reservoir simulation model was built based on the experiment test of the Eagle Ford core sample. History matching was performed for the model validation. After that, we examined the effects of adsorption and molecular diffusion on the multi-well production with CO2 injection. Results illustrate that in the CO2-EOR process, the molecular diffusion has a positive impact on the oil production, while adsorption negatively impacts the well production, indicating that the mechanisms should be reasonably incorporated in the simulation analysis. Additionally, simulation results show that the mechanisms of molecular diffusion and adsorption make great contributions to the capacity of CO2 storage in tight formations. This study provides a strong basis to reasonably forecast the long-term production during CO2 Huff-n-Puff process. Â© 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Comparative analysis of geo-engineering approaches to climate stabilization
AB  - Geo-engineering approaches to modern climate stabilization, irrelative to the Kyoto Protocol measures, are under consideration. Conditionally, these approaches are subdivided into two groups: Purposive changes in the Earth radiation balance to compensate the greenhouse gas effect and removal of the excessive amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The first group includes such methods as injection of sulfate and other reflecting aerosols into the stratosphere, creation of orbital reflectors or reflectors at the Lagrange point, an increase in cloudiness over the World Ocean, and a change in the Earth surface albedo. Increased carbon dioxide uptake by forests, ocean, and artificial absorbers are considered within the second group. The methods considered were subject to a comparative analysis using the following criteria: possible fast realization, the ability to counteract the doubling of greenhouse gases, availability of natural analogs, impact on geophysical systems within natural variations, the absence of unacceptable ecological implications, possibility, if necessary, to immediately halt the action. The comparison showed that the use of stratospheric sulfate aerosols can be the most effective. It is emphasized that all geo-engineering directions can be realized simultaneously with the measures stipulated by the Kyoto Protocol. Â© Allerton Press, Inc. 2009.

TI  - Assessing the Benthic Response to Climate-Driven Methane Hydrate Destabilisation: State of the Art and Future Modelling Perspectives
AB  - Modern observations and geological records suggest that anthropogenic ocean warming could destabilise marine methane hydrate, resulting in methane release from the seafloor to the ocean-atmosphere, and potentially triggering a positive feedback on global temperature. On the decadal to millennial timescales over which hydrate-sourced methane release is hypothesized to occur, several processes consuming methane below and above the seafloor have the potential to slow, reduce or even prevent such release. Yet, the modulating effect of these processes on seafloor methane emissions remains poorly quantified, and the full impact of benthic methane consumption on ocean carbon chemistry is still to be explored. In this review, we document the dynamic interplay between hydrate thermodynamics, benthic transport and biogeochemical reaction processes, that ultimately determines the impact of hydrate destabilisation on seafloor methane emissions and the ocean carbon cycle. Then, we provide an overview of how state-of-the-art numerical models treat such processes and examine their ability to quantify hydrate-sourced methane emissions from the seafloor, as well as their impact on benthic biogeochemical cycling. We discuss the limitations of current models in coupling the dynamic interplay between hydrate thermodynamics and the different reaction and transport processes that control the efficiency of the benthic sink, and highlight their shortcoming in assessing the full implication of methane release on ocean carbon cycling. Finally, we recommend that current Earth system models explicitly account for hydrate driven benthic-pelagic exchange fluxes to capture potential hydrate-carbon cycle-climate feed-backs.

TI  - Carbon stock and storage pattern in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, NE coast of India
AB  - This study covered spatial distribution of mangrove biomass, litter fall and intertidal sediment organic carbon storage pattern in the Indian part of the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans. The above and below ground (AGB and BGB) biomass spatially varied with high (57.28 +/- 3.17 and 28.24 +/- 2.64 Mg ha(-1)), moderate (44.81 +/- 8.13 and 20.88 +/- 1.41 Mg ha(-1)) and low (18.97 +/- 3.58 and 9.58 +/- 0.87 Mg ha(-1)) for inner, middle and outer zones of the mangrove biosphere. Trunk, branch and leaves formed 45.8, 34.7 and 19.5\% of AGB. The AGB: BGB was 2.07 indicating more carbon stock in trunk than root. Predominant mangroves genus Avicennia contributed 57\% of plant biomass. Pore-water salinity negatively regulated the distribution of plant biomass. Mean AGB (40.35 Mg ha(-1)) and BGB (19.57 Mg ha(-1)) and mean carbon content (40.5\%) yielded 10.35 Tg carbon stock in Indian Sundarbans. Litter fall varied from 8.95 to 12.30 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), supplying annually 284.7 Gg organic carbon to sediment. Sediment organic carbon (SOC) content varied from 0.92 to 3.29\% (avg. 1.99\%) building up an organic carbon stock of 59.14 Tg up to 90 cm depth of the intertidal sediment column. Organic carbon, humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) in sediment showed a decreasing trend with depth indicating organic matter decomposition and depletion of HA and FA accumulation rate. Based on mean concentration of HA and FA as 300 mu g g(-1) and 571 mu g g(-1) and their respective carbon percentage as 54.25 and 46.23, refractory organic carbon stock in the intertidal mangrove sediment was estimated as 1.7 Tg.

TI  - A review of carbon monitoring in wet carbon systems using remote sensing
AB  - Carbon monitoring is critical for the reporting and verification of carbon stocks and change. Remote sensing is a tool increasingly used to estimate the spatial heterogeneity, extent and change of carbon stocks within and across various systems. We designate the use of the term wet carbon system to the interconnected wetlands, ocean, river and streams, lakes and ponds, and permafrost, which are carbon-dense and vital conduits for carbon throughout the terrestrial and aquatic sections of the carbon cycle. We reviewed wet carbon monitoring studies that utilize earth observation to improve our knowledge of data gaps, methods, and future research recommendations. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic review collecting 1622 references and screening them with a combination of text matching and a panel of three experts. The search found 496 references, with an additional 78 references added by experts. Our study found considerable variability of the utilization of remote sensing and global wet carbon monitoring progress across the nine systems analyzed. The review highlighted that remote sensing is routinely used to globally map carbon in mangroves and oceans, whereas seagrass, terrestrial wetlands, tidal marshes, rivers, and permafrost would benefit from more accurate and comprehensive global maps of extent. We identified three critical gaps and twelve recommendations to continue progressing wet carbon systems and increase cross system scientific inquiry.

TI  - Qualification and validation of DTS/DSS technology for umbilical monitoring
AB  - The paper describes first the laboratory and qualifications works that were conducted to implement Distributed Fiber Optic Sensors (DOFS) such as Distributed Temperature and Strain Sensing (DTS/DSS) technologies in umbilicals. It also shows how these technologies have been implemented in the field for umbilical thermal and mechanical stresses monitoring. There is value to use DFOS for offshore structure integrity monitoring such as flow lines, risers and umbilicals. Other applications such as rating of power umbilicals, flow assurance or downhole sensing would help optimize field production as well. Currently, the offshore full scale implementation of DFOS technologies still faces challenges of its own. In particular, sensor integration into the structure to be monitored is a minimum requirement which applies to any DFOS. If fiber optic is a common mean of data transmission, subsea conditions imply the use of specific components such as Wet Mate Connectors (WMC) and Fiber Optic Rotary Joints (FORJ). These components present large insertion and return loss characteristics which are detrimental to most of the DFOS. The effect of these components is twofold. First it impacts the sensor optical budget limiting its measurement range. Second, sensor sections remain completely blind due to the high reflection levels leaving the structure without status information over distances that can be as large as several kilometers. The present works describes how DTS/DSS based on Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) can overcome the limitations imposed by both WMC and FORJ. The DOFS ability is justified theoretically and demonstrated experimentally through qualification trials involving hotspot detection while WMC and FORJ are part of the sensor path. Their effects are quantified through the determination of the measurement dead zone (shorter than 4m), the temperature uncertainty (better than 0.5K) and the resolution (below 0.5K while the measurement time remained unchanged (tens of seconds to minutes). The work also reports the subsequent installation on operational structures as these trials were successful. The DOFS has been installed to continuously monitor the temperature of a 3km long power umbilical and control the heating system of subsea rigid flowlines whose length can be as large a 45km.

TI  - The effect of pressure, temperature and salinity on CO2 dissolution into H2O + NACL
AB  - Sequestration of liquid CO2 into intermediate depth ocean has been considered as a means to reduce atmospheric concentration of this greenhouse gas and mitigate global warming. A number of CO2 droplets are released into ocean and are diluted. The CO2 solubility into sea water is very important in order to control the amount of released CO2 and environmental impact. Under conditions in the intermediate ocean, that is, high pressure and low temperature, the CO2 clathrate hydrate film was formed on the CO2 droplet surface. The hydrate film has been considered to decrease the dissolution rate and the CO2 concentration at the boundary layer on the droplet surface. In the experiments, LIF technique was used. The CO2 dissolved water emitted intense fluorescence, while the CO2 itself did not illuminate. Therefore, we could know the shrinking rate of CO2 droplet diameter accurately. The CO2 solubility was derived by using the measured shrinking rate. The solubility was investigated qualitatively with some variable parameters, i.e., pressure, temperature and salinity.

TI  - New true blueÂ® connections adapt to any environment or application
AB  - The Asia-Pacific region has had a number of new energy policies enacted in the last year - from new solar feed-in tariff rates to international agreements on fossil fuel development. The new policies have impacted numerous forms of energy generation, including renewable sources and natural gas. Along with solar and other renewable energy development, China also committed to increasing its use of natural gas. The government-owned National Offshore Oil Corp said in September it plans to add five liquefied natural gas receiving terminals by 2015 and double its capacity to as much as 40 million tons per year. The move will also help China increase its use of natural gas to 8 percent of its energy mix by 2015. Natural gas currently accounts for 5 percent of China's energy use. More natural gas also means China can cut air emissions from coal and reduce oil imports.

TI  - Assessment, management & prevention of methanol contamination in export crude
AB  - After methanol has been injected into a subsea tree, it flows back with produced fluid, partitioning between the oil, gas and water phases. Under production circumstances where water cut is low, high concentrations of methanol may be left in the oil phase. This leaves export crude contaminated with methanol which may result in penalties incurred due to pipeline export agreements. Several methods have been developed to control or minimize methanol concentration in the oil phase. The total volumes of methanol injected are compared against expected production flowrate values and a multiphase flow modeling exercise is carried out to track the arrival tendencies of the methanol injected at the tree. A model of the process system is created which considers GOR, water cut, fluid composition and production rates in order to track the partitioning behavior of the methanol. An assessment of the effect of several methanol control methods is conducted in order to select the most appropriate method while considering effect on CAPEX/OPEX, export agreements, and total system modification requirements. This paper will include a discussion of methanol partitioning behavior and the effect of water cut on export crude contamination levels. This is to provide a basis to identify whether or not methanol contamination may be an issue for a particular production scenario. This paper will discuss each control method in detail and outline the various benefits and drawbacks to each one. A discussion of the best option for methanol contamination control will investigate several considerations including topsides facilities, w hether the owner of the field operates the platform, whether there are other water-producing wells on the platform, and what the methanol export limits are. Each method will have an assessment of the relative impact on CAPEX and OPEX required for implementation. Methanol injection at the subsea trees is a common solution for hydrate control, valve equalization, and annulus pressure management. Controlling methanol content in export crude will help to alleviate the negative consequences associated with methanol injection during low water cut production scenarios. An effective methanol contamination control method will reduce or even eliminate penalties associated with contaminated crude production. Â©2017, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Internal ketone sulfonate: A new bio-sourced surfactant for chemical EOR in sea water
AB  - Surfactant Chemical EOR is a proven technology to increase oil recovery with several successful field trials. Offshore trials are less frequent due to the complexity of operations and also because of the limited availability of suitable chemicals adapted to sea water. For using classic anionic surfactants offshore, pretreatment of the water for reducing salinity or the use of alkali are required. In either case an additional unit has to be added to the platform, raising the price of oil production. The structure of the surfactant can be modified for sea water, using ethylene/propylene/butylene and their derivatives to prepare surfactants that are branched and sometimes extended. However sourcing can be an issue due to limitations on production sites. Internal Ketone Sulfonates (IKS) are new bio-sourced surfactants particularly suitable for chemical EOR in sea water. They are a good alternative to petro-derived chemicals with improved raw material availability and carbon footprint. Solubility is proved for TDS higher than 48g/L TDS in synthetic sea water. Phase behavior and low interfacial tensions were evaluated with classical Winsor analysis. Interfacial tension of 3.5*10âˆ’4 mN/m between the IKS formulation and dodecane was reached at the optimal salinity of 31 g/L TDS (R+=0.13) for a temperature of 60Â°C. The formulation was tested for oil recovery under dynamic porous media conditions and allowed to recover RF = 99% (+/-1.7%) after water flood. Copyright Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - ABB SCR Converter: Cutting down total emissions from the funnel
AB  - The ABB SRC converter is designed for both newbuild and retrofitting of marine diesel engines. It effectively deals with nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons. These pollutants are converted into nitrogen and water vapour. The converter allows the diesel engine to operate a maximum efficiency and therefore does not compromise fuel economy with clean emissions. It also significantly reduces NOx emissions from the funnel. It replaces the silencer and takes up no more space than a conventional exhaust system. A monitoring and control system allows emissions levels to be adjusted to meet differing requirements. The first unit was installed in 1992, and Operational-1.c experience has proven units to perform well and reliably. Principles of operation and performance are examined.

TI  - Improvements in the design of a swage pile connection system for jackets
AB  - In the North Sea, weight considerations have become an important issue in the design of jackets. This has largely arisen due to the ability of the new superbarges to lift install jackets which would otherwise have required design for barge launch. The swaged pile connection system which has been used for several years on subsea structures offers several advantages for such structures. Nevertheless in its existing form, although the system offers considerable advantages for jackets the potential weight penalty could influence its acceptance by the industry. A development programme has been undertaken which has demonstrated how the weight of the pile sleeves used for the swage system can be reduced by 35% - 40%. This has been achieved with the minimum of changes to the already established and certified designs. The paper discusses this work. The paper also describes the design and installation of the first jacket to be installed using the revised system. This jacket, conventionally barge launched, was installed for Elf Aquitaine in approximately 500 ft sea water in the Gulf of Mexico. Copyright 1991, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Deep ocean seafloor mineral extraction - Environmental and social considerations
AB  - Nautilus Minerals (Nautilus) is following the lead of the petroleum industry as it strives to tap vast offshore resources. Planning is well underway for the Solwara 1 Project in the Bismarck Sea, Papua New Guinea (PNG) to recover high grade seafloor massive sulphide deposits in 1600 m water depth. The deposit contains an average copper grade >10 times higher than a typical land-based porphyry copper mine. The high grades combined with a relatively small amount of overburden ensure the Solwara 1 Project will have a significantly smaller physical footprint than its land-based counterparts. Offshore minerals production also has the advantage of minimal social disturbance. Nautilus is dedicated to setting a high environmental and social responsibility standard. Nautilus recognises the importance of transparent and inclusive stakeholder engagement and has taken a proactive approach to involve as many stakeholders as possible. One of the first steps in the permitting process is the preparation of the Environmental Inception Report, which describes the project, its envisaged impacts and the proposed studies for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Local (PNG-based) and international environmental scientists, anthropologists, NGOs and other experts were involved in the definition of studies conducted for the Solwara 1 EIA and a team of world-leading experts was involved with carrying out the studies, culminating in the preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). To ensure transparency, collaborating researchers are free to publish their findings. Following its submission, the EIS was made available for public review and public hearings were held at several locations. The EIS has also undergone a rigorous independent review by PNG government-engaged consultants. Outside the permitting process, Nautilus works alongside government officials to carry out ongoing community consultations. Information dissemination and feedback acquisition has also occurred through the Nautilus website and attendance at a number of international conferences, workshops, and meetings. This paper will outline the leading edge approach Nautilus has taken in completing the environmental impact statement for the world's first deep seafloor copper-gold mine. In addition, this paper will review the permitting process and the government and stakeholder engagement undertaken as part of Nautilus' desire to "do it right" in this exciting new industry.

TI  - After the race
AB  - Toyota Motorsport reckons that it can sell its expertise to a wide range of industries as it seeks a new role after moving out of Formula One due to the economic downturn. Toyota has unveiled plans for Marsdorf that could see it start to grow again. The facility is being restructured as a provider of design, development and production services to outside customers. The wind tunnel is quickly seeded with particles and then the PIV system's laser is flashed twice in quick succession to take two synchronized photos. Those images can then be taken and compared to what has been measured in CFD, enabling Toyota to ensure the CFD parameters are tuned to give an accurate representation of what is happening in the wind tunnel, improving the relationship between the two disciplines. Toyota also hopes to transfer such skills to the renewable-energy sector to make parts for offshore wind structures.

TI  - Geometrical risk evaluation of the collisions between ships and offshore installations using rule-based Bayesian reasoning
AB  - Increasing human installations and vessel traffic in offshore waters render a collision risk between ships and offshore installations (SOI). Past decades have witnessed many accidents occurred in the offshore waters involving complex traffic networks. To safeguard offshore installations and improve water-bound transport safety, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian-based model to assess the SOI collision risk involving passing ships. It first identifies the relevant risk factors with the aid of a geometrical analysis concerning SOI collisions. The causal relationships between the risk factors are numerically defined by causal rules with a degree of belief structure, while a Bayesian network (BN) is constructed to aggregate the evaluated value of each risk factor and to assess the collision risks involving different navigational environments. To illustrate the new model, a real case on SOI collision risk in the Liverpool Burbo Bank offshore wind farm is investigated. The results provide empirical evidence for SOI collision risk analysis under complex water conditions and uncertain navigational environments and hence useful insights on SOI collision avoidance.

TI  - Successful cement plug in HPHT pre-salt offshore well in Brazil
AB  - Industry successful cases and lessons learned have shown the challenges of setting cement plugs in open hole. Using industry best practices, it is possible to successfully set cement plugs in deepwater HPHT wells drilled with non-aqueous fluids. However, it is not uncommon to see cases where a single cement plug job has to be repeated more than once in order to achieve a competent barrier. Among different reasons that would cause a cement plug to fail, are: contamination with non-aqueous drilling fluid, insufficient cement and spacer volumes, density hierarchy, friction pressure hierarchy and cement plug slumping. These challenges become more critical as offshore drilling moves towards new frontiers: deepwater, salt formations, deeper measured depth reaching higher bottom hole temperatures and pressures. In Brazil, drilling operators do not face one single challenge in their operations; they are facing a combination of them in most of the new wells. A successful case will be discussed, which describes the placement of a cement plug isolating an over-pressured gas reservoir and allowing the plug and abandonment operation to continue on a HPHT pre-salt offshore well in Santos Basin, in Brazil. The bottom hole pressure was over 137.8 MPa [20,000 psi] (ultra-high pressure well) and bottom hole temperature 171 degC [340 degF], required 2300 kg/m3 [19.2 lbm/gal] mud weight to maintain the well overbalanced after a gas influx happened when the mud had only a density of 2230 kg/m3 [18.6 lbm/gal]. In addition, the heavy-weight and non-aqueous fluid (NAF) added an extra challenge to this operation. On this case, high density, high performance system (HDHPS) with engineered particle size distribution (PSD) was the selected cement slurry in order to overcome ultra-high formation pressure. Special chemistry was combined to the HDHPS to place the cement plug across the gas reservoir and salt formation, maintaining its stability and assuring isolation of the gas in the reservoir. The cement plug placement was designed with dedicated cement plug placement software, which brought a superior value in analyzing the risks involved, determining the placement technique and confirming best practices, thus aiding to define the pre-job conditions and consequently assuring the success of the P&A. These practices can be successfully extended to other operators plugging and abandoning their wells in deepwater, HPHT wells and even in conventional environments.

TI  - Proof of value in automating the drill floor
AB  - It is commonly known that the drilling sector of the oil and gas industry has lagged other batch and process industries such as the automotive and aerospace industries in terms of adopting new technologies. Historically, the oil and gas industry has been risk-adverse to deploying new technologies typically using the mindset â€œIf isn't broken, do not fix itâ€. Technologies that have made it through commercialization have typically centered around solving a problem or accomplishing something that has not been done before, such as the ability to install heavier tubular strings or the ability to complete a well in an environment not previously accomplishable. However, lower commodity pricing is forcing the industry to become more cost-effective at drilling all types wells such that the industry can remain profitable in the current environment. This has created a technology trend to drill wells at a lower cost, which has put a focus on process improvement and process optimization, something not heavily focused on previously. Borrowing off other industries, an accelerated rate of adopting new technologies is being realized, especially digital and robotic technologies that can remove personnel from the rig floor and automate processes that are repetitive in nature. The drill floor is naturally seen as an area where the repetitious nature of pipe handling, installation, and removal can be automated for safety and efficiency. Although technologies do currently exist to mechanize the process, further automation of the process without compromising the functions required at well center has been difficult to be viewed as value added and profitable. Based on experience and research on these operations, proof of value can be demonstrated to show what makes sense in terms of automating the drill floor.

TI  - Transcriptomic response of sea urchin larvae Strongylocentrotus purpuratus to CO2-driven seawater acidification
AB  - Ocean acidification from the uptake of anthropogenic CO2 is expected to have deleterious consequences for many calcifying marine animals. Forecasting the vulnerability of these marine organisms to climate change is linked to an understanding of whether species possess the physiological capacity to compensate for the potentially adverse effects of ocean acidification. We carried out a microarray-based transcriptomic analysis of the physiological response of larvae of a calcifying marine invertebrate, the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, to CO2-driven seawater acidification. In lab-based cultures, larvae were raised under conditions approximating current ocean pH conditions (pH8.01) and at projected, more acidic pH conditions (pH7.96 and 7.88) in seawater aerated with CO2 gas. Targeting expression of -1000 genes involved in several biological processes, this study captured changes in gene expression patterns that characterize the transcriptomic response to CO2-driven seawater acidification of developing sea urchin larvae. In response to both elevated CO2 scenarios, larvae underwent broad scale decreases in gene expression in four major cellular processes: biomineralization, cellular stress response, metabolism and apoptosis. This study underscores that physiological processes beyond calcification are impacted greatly, suggesting that overall physiological capacity and not just a singular focus on biomineralization processes is essential for forecasting the impact of future CO2 conditions on marine organisms. Conducted on targeted and vulnerable species, genomics-based studies, such as the one highlighted here, have the potential to identify potential 'weak links' in physiological function that may ultimately determine an organism's capacity to tolerate future ocean conditions.

TI  - Wear and its effect on electrical submersible pump ESP performance degradation by sandy flow: Experiments and modeling
AB  - Multi-stage electrical submersible pump (ESP) is a frequently used artificial lift method, especially in high production wells. Severe wear and leakage can be caused by sand production from unconsolidated sandstone and proppant backflow. The loss of boosting ability and system stability under sandy flow condition is hard to be predicted, which not only reduces the production but also causes severe failures. In this study, a closed testing flow loop with a mixed type ESP is constructed to test pump performance and efficiency under water-sand flow. 64 hours total testing time is divided into several short intervals. After each interval test, the deteriorated head and efficiency of ESP with pure water were tested. More head loss was observed under low flow rate region, which is presumably caused by leakage through the secondary flow region. Head curve acquired in the test is compared to other studies to analyze the leakage effect in different regions. A leakage flow map including three different regions is provided. The seals' ID/OD and clearances were measured after the pump was disassembled. The leakage effect in previous mechanistic ESP performance prediction model is modified based on test results. By using the appropriate geometries, the deteriorated head curve can be calculated. Compared to the test curves, the proposed model agrees well with the head degradation trend. The model can be further improved by adding abrasion and efficiency models with more available data. Copyright Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Disrupting the effects of synergies between stressors: improved water quality dampens the effects of future CO2 on a marine habitat
AB  - Synergies among stressors drive unanticipated changes to alternative states, yet little has been done to assess whether alleviating one or more contributing stressors may disrupt these interactions. It would be particularly useful to understand whether the synergistic effects of global and local stressors could be alleviated, leading to slower change or faster recovery, if conditions under the control of local management alone were managed (i.e. nutrient pollution). We utilized field-based mesocosms to manipulate CO2 (i.e. forecasted global concentrations) and nutrients (i.e. local pollution) to test the hypothesis that, where synergies exist, reducing one contributing stressor would limit the effect of the other. In testing this hypothesis, we considered the response of turfing algae, which can displace kelp forests on urbanized coastlines. Initial manipulations of CO2 and nutrient enrichment produced an anticipated synergistic effect on the biomass of turfing algae. Following exposure of algal turfs to a combination of enriched nutrients and CO2, a subsequent reduction in nutrients was able to substantially slow further increases in turf growth. Despite this substantial effect, the historical legacy of previous nutrient enrichment was evident as greater turf was maintained relative to ambient conditions (i.e. ambient CO2 and nutrients). Such legacies of past stressors may be stubborn (e.g. persist as intergenerational change) where the alternative state (i.e. turf algae) has substantial resilience to restorative actions. Synthesis and applications. As stressors accumulate across global to local scales, some combine to produce synergistic effects which cause changes of disproportionate ecological magnitude. While strong synergies attract heavy scrutiny, there remains substantial merit in assessing whether their influence can be ameliorated by managing a contributing stressor. Of note, we show that by reducing a locally determined stressor (nutrients), its synergistic effects with a globally determined stressor (CO2 enrichment) on a key taxon (turf algae) may be substantially reduced. These results suggest that in the face of changing climate (e.g. ocean acidification), the management of local stressors (e.g. water pollution) may have a greater contribution in determining the dominant state than current thinking allows.

TI  - The stability of marine sediments at a tidal basin in San Francisco Bay amended with activated carbon for sequestration of organic contaminants
AB  - Recent laboratory studies show that adding activated carbon to marine sediments reduces the bioavailability of persistent organic contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, to benthic organisms. The present work investigates how mixing activated carbon into cohesive sediment affects the stability of sediment obtained from the intertidal zone at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard Superfund site in South Basin, San Francisco Bay, CA. Our results show for these sediments that mixing activated carbon into sediment does not significantly affect stability of surface sediments, as measured by sediment erosion rate and critical shear stress for incipient motion, thus supporting the potential field application of this technique for in situ stabilization of persistent organic contaminants. Hydrodynamic modeling was used to estimate the maximum bottom shear stress encountered during high-wind storm events at the estuarine inlet from which the sediments were obtained. Comparison of estimated bottom shear stresses with measured critical shear stresses shows that surface sediments will not erode under normal, non-storm conditions. Bottom shear stresses caused by large waves under infrequent high-wind storm conditions may erode surface sediments for short periods of time. We conclude from sediment stability tests and hydrodynamic modeling that mixing activated carbon amendment with cohesive sediment at selected locations within South Basin will not reduce surface sediment stability nor result in significant erosion of treated sediments.

TI  - Transport impacts on atmosphere and climate: Shipping
AB  - Emissions of exhaust gases and particles from oceangoing ships are a significant and growing contributor to the total emissions from the transportation sector. We present an assessment of the contribution of gaseous and particulate emissions from oceangoing shipping to anthropogenic emissions and air quality. We also assess the degradation in human health and climate change created by these emissions. Regulating ship emissions requires comprehensive knowledge of current fuel consumption and emissions, understanding of their impact on atmospheric composition and climate, and projections of potential future evolutions and mitigation options. Nearly 70\% of ship emissions occur within 400 km of coastlines, causing air quality problems through the formation of ground-level ozone, sulphur emissions and particulate matter in coastal areas and harbours with heavy traffic. Furthermore, ozone and aerosol precursor emissions as well as their derivative species from ships may be transported in the atmosphere over several hundreds of kilometres, and thus contribute to air quality problems further inland, even though they are emitted at sea. In addition, ship emissions impact climate. Recent studies indicate that the cooling due to altered clouds far outweighs the warming effects from greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) or ozone from shipping, overall causing a negative present-day radiative forcing (RF). Current efforts to reduce sulphur and other pollutants from shipping may modify this. However, given the short residence time of sulphate compared to CO2, the climate response from sulphate is of the order decades while that of CO2 is centuries. The climatic trade-off between positive and negative radiative forcing is still a topic of scientific research, but from what is currently known, a simple cancellation of global mean forcing components is potentially inappropriate and a more comprehensive assessment metric is required. The CO2 equivalent emissions using the global temperature change potential (GTP) metric indicate that after 50 years the net global mean effect of current emissions is close to zero through cancellation of warming by CO2 and cooling by sulphate and nitrogen oxides.

TI  - Safety enhancement to offshore drilling operations
AB  - In the ongoing process of the offshore industry to improve safety aspects of drilling operations, ABS continues to provide support by developing enhanced safety requirements. This paper addresses the latest research that ABS performed to enhance its understanding of critical safety aspects in drilling operations and subsequent utilization of the results in updating the ABS Guide for the Classification of Drilling Systems (ABS CDS Guide). Several U.S. government regulatory initiatives have been implemented relative to offshore drilling operational safety. Other governmental regulators have also taken a similar approach in assessing their existing regulations with the focus on safety improvements. In parallel, the revised ABS CDS Guide provides updated safety requirements to assist industry to (1) improve overall safety in drilling operations and (2) meet regulatory compliance for the drilling systems. ABS commenced the criteria revision process with a gap-analysis between the existing offshore drilling practices and technology (including deepwater), applicable U.S. and worldwide regulations, recognized industry codes and standards, etc. Additionally, a survey was conducted with manufacturers, operators, and drilling contractors to identify main areas where the safety aspect of drilling operation could be improved. Based on the research and survey, industry's participation was a critical element in the rule making process - it provided insight into various safety issues, concerns in drilling operations and improved understanding between the industry and the regulators or Class society. From this process, ABS was able to develop additional measures to enhance existing criteria for drilling operations, while adopting a holistic approach to the classification process of drilling systems and equipment with consideration to the applicable regulatory initiatives. This paper outlines the currently developing regulatory changes to the U.S. drilling industry that may potentially impact worldwide drilling activities. This paper highlights the new safety requirements from our research and from the U.S. regulatory perspective, including: BOP recertification, maintenance, and testing, API RP 53 rewrite to API Spec 53 for adoption into the U.S. CFR, management of safety and environmental systems of API RP 75, safety case initiatives and the role of third-party certification.

TI  - Cost-effective HPHT design methods using external and seawater depth pressures
AB  - External pressures due to hydrostatic heads on subsea equipment which fall under API SC 17 can now be accounted for in the equipment design and rating as a depth-Adjusted working pressure (DAWP) with design guidelines from the recently published API 17 TR 12. This can be beneficial for overcoming some challenges in designing the HPHT equipment and can also result in economically efficient and lightweight equipment. However, design guidelines of recently published API 17 TR 8 w ill need to be followed for designing HPHT subsea equipment. Combining the two design guidelines, it is possible to design or adjust the working pressures based on the working depths for the subsea equipment for HPHT applications. This paper suggests how to combine the design and validation guidelines of API 17 TR 8 and API 17 TR 12. It recommends the different load cases to be analyzed based on recommendations of API 17 TR 12 and applicable design methods from API 17 TR 8 to be used for those particular load cases. Validation testing requirements pose a challenge when combining these two guidelines, and this paper makes an effort to clarify' them according to the component under consideration. It also addresses the fatigue screening and analysis criteria based on the components under consideration. To demonstrate these design methods and load eases, an example analysis of a 15.000-psi subsea component is presented with results for uprating the internal pressures up to 20.000-psi using external pressures due to different working seawater depths. API I 7 TR 12 refers to API 17 TR 8 for a well shut-in pressure greater than 15,000-psi. In the situation in which subsea equipment requires a slightly higher operating pressure (approximately 10 to 15% of the absolute rated working pressure), the equipment can benefit in utilizing DAWP. This paper also recommends the design and validation methods for situations in which the well shut-in pressure is at or below 15,000-psi but the depth-Adjusted working pressure is above 15.000-psi. This situation would typically occur during a bullheading or well kill. For this type of equipment, and in general potential time and investment can be saved by depth adjusting the working pressures to pressures slightly higher than 15.000-psi instead of developing an absolute-rated 20,000-psi system.

TI  - Extensive Laboratory Test to Validate Material Selection for CO2 Injector in Depleted Carbonate Field - A Case Study of Carbon Capture and Storage Development Project in Offshore Malaysia
AB  - As part of decarbonization initiatives, the K1 field CCS project plans to capture the CO2 produced from the nearby gas field development and store it in the depleted carbonate reservoir. One of the challenges in CCS project is to choose the optimum material for the well design. This paper presents the case study of CO2 injection well material selection of K1 field CCS project development. The injection fluid contains more than 90-98% CO2 and about 500-711 ppm of H2S. This condition and presence of free water might create high risk environment for Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) and Sulfide Stress Cracking (SSC). Materials were initially screened based on Oil Company Tubular Good (OCTG) charts. Further qualification was deemed required through fit for purpose tests which represent the most likely and worst-case conditions. Test matrix has been developed based on NACE TM 0177 and NACE TM 0136 guidelines. Initial material selection using the OCTG chart suggested 25 Cr as a suitable material. No verification through the lab test is required for this material. As an alternative material, 22 Cr and enhanced 13 Cr were considered, subject to further verification on Sulfide Stress Cracking (SSC) and Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC). The test matrix had been developed to simulate two scenarios where the injected gas mixes with condensed water during injection and flowback of formation water. For enhanced 13 Cr material, SSC test is performed at 24Â°C and 34Â°C. The temperature of 24Â°C is chosen as the temperature of highest susceptibility of SSC expected to occur for martensitic material. For temperature of 34Â°C, it is performed to investigate the effect of supercritical CO2 fluid phase on the corrosion and cracking if any. For 22 Cr which is duplex material, the test is performed at temperature of 90Â°C, which is the temperature of the highest SSC susceptibility of duplex material expected to occur. The corrosion and cracking test result show that the material suitable for more than 90% CO2 with about 711 ppm of H2S in condensed water condition and flowback fluid condition is 22 Cr and above grade. As part of material selection process, extensive lab tests to qualify tubing material has been performed by both OCTG manufacturer and independent lab. The result enables further optimization on well cost while giving assurance on K1 CCS injector well's integrity. Copyright Â© 2022, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - ORION: Shaping shetland as the UK's first green energy Island
AB  - The ORION (Opportunity Renewables Integration Offshore Networks) project was launched in April 2020 when Shetland Island Council (SIC) and the OGTC formed a strategic partnership to work on an energy hub concept with Highland & Islands Enterprise (HIE), government and industry. Strathclyde University joined in May 2021 as a strategic partner. Shetland has all the critical ingredients of clean energy provision There is significant onshore and offshore wind and tidal resource; strategically important hydrocarbon resource; established oil and gas infrastructure; and a knowledgeable and skilled local workforce. The aim of ORION is threefold:- â€¢ To enable offshore oil and gas sector transition to net zero by electrification, utilising initially onshore and then offshore wind, sustaining thousands of jobs and security of supply. â€¢ To transform Shetland's current dependency on fossil fuels to affordable renewable energy to address fuel poverty and improve community wealth. â€¢ To create a green hydrogen export business on Shetland at industrial scale by harnessing offshore wind power and creating new jobs. ORION has set several ambitious targets by 2050. These include abating 8mT/year of CO2 from offshore oil and gas production; supplying 32TWh of low carbon hydrogen annually - 12% of UK expected requirement; and generating more than 3GW of wind. The annual revenue generated by the project by 2050 would be around Â£5Bn per annum and provide sustainable employment, both locally and regionally, for 1750 people. Techno-economic screening is currently underway, and several individual opportunities are undergoing concept and feasibility analysis. The ORION project is transformational, on both a local and regional scale, positioning Shetland as one of the first green energy islands in the UK. Â© 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers

TI  - Wave attenuation mechanism of the artificial reef in Beidaihe, China
AB  - The Beidaihe District is a famous tourist resort in North China characterized by high quality sand beaches. The beautiful shore environment had driven at least 1.6 billion US dollar income during the years from 2009 to 2012 when beach nourishment projects were implemented in large scale. Since recreational and aesthetic values are necessary considerations in the shore protection, artificial submerged reefs, a group of cuboid perforated blocks made by reinforced concrete aligned as a shore-parallel array, were applied in these projects to attenuate destructive waves. Aiming at storm waves, the submerged perforated reef were studied using flume experiments. Irregular waves in JONSWAP spectrum with five sets of wave heights and periods were used. The reflection coefficient, transmission coefficient and the coefficient of energy loss were obtained from measurements. Wave and velocity processes near the reef were analyzed and compared. In general, the wave attenuation mechanism of the artificial reef can be summarized as follows: the reef causes more dissipation than reflection to attenuate the waves; the reef reflects more short waves than long waves; long waves are mainly dissipated by the reef and turns into short waves that lead to high proportion of short waves in transmitted waves; the dissipation effect of the reef increases with the wave height and period; with the increase of incident wave height, more wave breaking happens in wave passing the reef; after the reef, wave crest becomes steeper and wave trough is flatter, which causes a highly asymmetrical wave shape.

TI  - E-GNSS Use for Autonomous Vessels: Value proposition and market aspects
AB  - Recent technological developments have encouraged the development and implementation of autonomous systems in areas ranging from military surveillance (i.e. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, UAVs) to civilian transport. There are several examples of land-based applications using autonomous control concepts to meet current and envisaged future competitiveness, safety and sustainability challenges. In the case of maritime transport, next generation modular control systems and communications technology will enable wireless monitoring and control functions both on and off board. These will include advanced decision support systems to provide a capability to operate ships remotely under semi or fully autonomous control. Ship Intelligence will be the next major transition for the shipping industry as ships are set to become more complex and will require high levels of data analysis to operate on-board systems to manage propulsion, navigation and potentially lead to autonomous vessels. No persons are expected on board for the whole or part of the voyage. The ship, with partial help from remote control centre, must be able to manage the voyage on its own. In this context, EGUS (E-GNSS User Support) Specific Contract 4 (SC4) aims at supporting to GSA in the Market Development of Autonomous Vessels and Off-Shore applications, focusing in the use of E-GNSS for these applications. EGUS project is funded and managed by GSA (European GNSS Agency), being the industrial partners Ineco (prime), ESSP and GMV. GMV is in charge of the analysis of Autonomous Vessels, which is the aim of this paper. More specifically, the activities to be performed within EGUS SC4 on autonomous vessels navigation are focused on Oceanic/Deep Sea and Coastal Waters Navigation, and are following the next strategy: Development of Market Assessment \& Value Proposition of using E-GNSS in Autonomous Vessels, including the steps included below: Overview of the Autonomous Vessels Identification of requirements Identification of GNSS value chain proposition: identification of potential technologies/services and added EGNSS value (e.g. Galileo authentication service, SBAS integrity at system and user levels) Market status and evolution Elaboration of a SWOT \& CBA of using EGNSS in Autonomous Vessels, to analyse the feasibility of the adoption of E-GNSS in such technology. Preparation of an action plan for adoption, taking into account boundaries conditions and including as main axis the action plan of further development of E-GNSS In order to evaluate the potential use of E-GNSS for autonomous vessel applications, an estimation of the level of performance that could be achieved with such GNSS is to be conducted as part of the project. To this aim, a tool developed by GMV in the frame of EC's PROSBAS project is to be used. This prototype allows the performance assessment not only for EGNOS V2 but also with its evolution EGNOS V3, implements SBAS L1/L5 capabilities and has been specifically prepared for maritime users. The use of this tool will allow analysing if such performance will fulfil the user requirements for the autonomous vessels application. The aim of this paper is to provide a summary of the activities developed so far as part of EGUS SC4, including the analyses of performance developed and a summary of the main outcomes of the surveys/interviews performed within the project as part of the market status and evolution analysis.

TI  - Enchilada: From border town to cowtown
AB  - Since first production in 1997, Enchilada has evolved from a multi-platform development, using direct vertical access (DVA) wells, to a processing and pipeline hub where the majority of the production is from surrounding developments. Located in 600'-700' of water, in the northeast corner of the Garden Banks area, Enchilada borders the deepwater leases. Although the original project was justified as a significant stand-alone development, infrastructure on the Shelf / Deepwater edge was recognized as having strategic value. In order to capture this value, choices were made during development and subsequent to the initial development that have helped shape Enchilada today. This paper will describe the transition to a hub facility, and will highlight some of the choices that have made Enchilada unique. Copyright 2003, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Need for Asian regional Spent Fuel Recycle Center (ARRC)
AB  - Energy demand is increasing rapidly in the Asia-Pacific region. From the viewpoint of preventing global warming, countries in the region are expected to introduce more nuclear power plants (NPPs) which do not emit greenhouse gases (GHGs). At the end of this century, the capacity for NPPs is estimated to reach around 1600GWe and around 300,000 tons of uranium (TU) as spent fuel will be accumulated. The spent fuel from the NPPs should be reprocessed and fabricated into MOX fuel to decrease the amounts of radioactive wastes and future fuel recycling should be supported in the Asian Regional Spent Fuel Recycle Center (ARRC) under international regulation. The ARRC will include a reprocessing plant, an MOX fuel fabrication plant, a high-activity vitrified solid waste storage facility, and sea discharge pipes for extremely low activity liquid wastes etc. Furthermore, the ARRC should be operated as a component in an international organization scheme, an ASIATOM and it should accept the full scope of IAEA safeguards to verify the nonproliferation of nuclear materials. When the ARRC is designed, knowledge obtained through experiences in the Tokai and the Rokkasho reprocessing plants in Japan, which is a non-nuclear weapons country, will be used.

TI  - Location optimization of hydrogen refueling stations in hydrogen expressway based on hydrogen supply chain cost
AB  - Hydrogen energy is regarded as an important way to achieve carbon emission reduction. This paper focuses on the combination of the design of the hydrogen supply chain network and the location of hydrogen refueling stations on the expressway. Based on the cost analysis of the hydrogen supply chain, a multi-objective model is developed to determine the optimal scale and location of hydrogen refueling stations on the hydrogen expressway. The proposed model considers the hydrogen demand forecast, hydrogen source selection, hydrogen production and storage and transportation, hydrogen station refueling mode, etc. Taking Dalian City, China as an example, with offshore wind power as a reliable green hydrogen supply to select the location and capacity of hydrogen refueling stations for the hydrogen energy demonstration section of a certain expressway under multiple scenarios. The results of the case show that 4 and 5 stations are optimized on the expressway section respectively, and the unit hydrogen cost is $14.3 /kg H2 and $11.8 /kg H2 respectively, which are equal to the average hydrogen price in the international range. The optimization results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the model. Â© 2021 The authors and IOS Press.

TI  - Subsea power supply based on submarine propulsion technology
AB  - The paper reports on the development of electrical subsea power generation and storage systems based on non-nuclear air independent submarine propulsion technologies. Proven submarine technology represents a promising base for innovative and high-performance subsea solutions. Reliable and cost efficient electric power supply can be regarded as one of the most important factors for the successful development and operation of future subsea facilities. Long step outs, large water depths and remote locations without topside infrastructure pose challenges to cable based solutions. Submarine technologies can help to overcome these issues. Within the scope of the paper, an overview of conventional (non-nuclear) military submarine propulsion technology and its perspectives to be applied for civil subsea power supply systems is given. The outlined technologies include diesel-electric propulsion, lead and lithium ion batteries, and air independent propulsion (AIP) systems. For the latter, fuel cells and closed cycle diesel systems are described. The present work highlights the potential of such technologies to be applied as an energy supply for subsea systems. A modular concept is presented which is applicable for water depths up to 3000 m. It consists of battery components to satisfy large intermittent power demands as well as AIP modules which will be able to offer moderate base loads. This way, tailored hybrid battery/AIP solutions can be created which fit the needs of specific stationary and mobile subsea appliances. The concepts can easily be scaled in power and energy.

TI  - New insight into global blue carbon estimation under human activity in land-sea interaction area: A case study of China
AB  - The C sequestration in coastal blue carbon (C-b) ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes, was discovered to be useful in mitigating the increasing trend of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission due to climate change. In this study, we systematically estimate traditional C-b ecosystem distribution and the associated C-b sequestration rate, and then further quantify the C-b sinks fishery contribution to C-b ecosystem due to human activity in coastal ecosystem. The results show that the global C-b ecosystem is able to store 10.8 PgC, wherein biomass and soil are able to store 2.13 and 8.68 PgC, respectively. In China, the C-b pools are 162 TgC in mangroves, 67 TgC in saltmarshes and 75 TgC in seagrass. The human activity induced global C-b sink fishery on C-b ecosystem is about 26.58-37.6 TgC yr(-1), accounting for 30.7\%-43.4\% of the world's traditional C-b sequestration ecosystem. The global C-b sequestration potential reaches up to 86.59 Tg yr(-1), while China can explain 1.70\% of the world's total C-b sequestration. However, in China, the C-b sequestration due to human activity reaches up to 632-7.89 TgC yr(-1), accounting for 20.9\%-23.7\% of global C-b sink fishery. Therefore, it is very important to build the C-b sink fisheries measure and monitor system to scientifically valuate C-b sink fisheries and associated development potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The investigation of ecosystems under extreme environmental stress where their mere existance seem to be in contradiction to previous dogmas has been in the focus of exploration. On the surface the transmission bandwidth can be improved with a certain number of buoys deployed or ships underway to form a transitional transmission network.

TI  - Wave spreading and wave drift loads for a standard lng carrier in shallow water
AB  - The need for LNG export and import terminals is anticipated to grow as natural gas progressively accounts for a larger fraction of worldwide consumed energy. These terminals are preferably located nearshore i.e. in relatively shallow water. Design of floating structures is most of the time performed assuming long-crested waves. In shallow water, diffraction of waves by a variable bathymetry can result in wave spreading i.e. in short crested seas. The effect of short crested seas on the wave drift load spectral densities for a 135,000m3 storage capacity LNG Carrier in 15m water depth is investigated. It is shown that the impact of wave spreading on drift loads depends on the natural frequency of the moored vessel and thus on the stiffness of the mooring system under consideration. Although response calculations are not performed herein for reasons to be discussed, it is conceivable that wave spreading could adversely affect loading/offloading terminal availability for stiff moorings.

TI  - Sustainable exploitation of deep seabed mineral resources in the Indo-Pacific through practical cooperation under the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative
AB  - In order to reduce global temperature rise to 15-2 degrees C against the pre-industrial values as agreed in the Paris Agreement, the world community has begun focusing on renewable energy. This effort requires nearly double the quantity of minerals as required for a 4 degrees C rise and has forced humanity to look at exploiting deep seabed minerals. While extracting minerals from the Area Beyond the National Jurisdiction requires rules and permission of the International Seabed Authority, those in the national jurisdiction require permission of the concerned state. With focus on `sustainability' as defined by the UN Sustainable Development Goals and on Security and Growth for all in the Region, the Indian Prime Minister announced the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative in 2019 with `Marine Resource' exploitation as one of the pillars of mutual cooperation and growth. Accordingly, this article explores the possible practical cooperation for sustainable deep seabed mineral exploitation in the Indo-Pacific under the IPOI.

TI  - Louisiana barrier islands and their importance in wetland protection: Forecasting shoreline change and subsequent response of wave climate
AB  - The role that barrier islands play in mitigating the wave climate in lower energy, bay or lagoonal environments has not yet been addressed in detail. With the exception of one study in which a shallow water wave prediction model (HISWA) (LIST et. al., 1992) was applied to idealized barrier-bay configurations, the critical linkages among barriers, wave energy transmission into bays, regenerated local waves, and subsequent wave climate have not been made. In Louisiana, barrier disintegration is rapid over the short-term (10(2) years) and the mere potential for impacts of barrier loss on the bay wave climate is highly significant. Because of a paucity in scientific data which could be utilized to address this issue, there remains a significant debate as to the value of barrier islands in mitigating wave climate in the bays and along fringing marshes. In this paper we present historical shoreline change data which are used to predict the rapid disintegration of a section of barrier island coast along central Louisiana (Isles Dernieres) and resultant forecasted increases in wave energy in the adjacent bays. The methods associated with shoreline, bathymetric and wave energy forecasting are briefly presented as an example of a larger, ongoing project regarding the feasibility of large-scale barrier island restoration in Louisiana. A brief overview of the magnitude and causal mechanisms associated with wetland loss are provided in addition to the implications associated with barrier island loss and subsequent detrimental impacts on fringing marshes. The example data set presented here indicates that the role of Louisiana's barrier islands comprising the Isles Dernieres in mitigating the wave climate in their adjacent bays and fringing marshes appears critical. Considering only fairweather conditions, the data indicate that the bays adjacent to the Isles Dernieres could experience an increase in wave height of 700\% if the barrier chain is reduced to shoals. Although large-scale barrier island restoration will greatly reduce wave energy in Louisiana's bays and along fringing marshes, additional devices capable of absorbing wave energy around portions of the fringing marshes will likely require construction. This may occur in areas where the fetch permits regeneration of incident waves that have propagated across the Louisiana shelf, or locally generated higher frequency waves.

TI  - COUPLING OF MULTI-EFFECT DISTILLATION WITH VACUUM FREEZING TO REDUCE ENERGY COST IN SEA WATER DESALINATION.
AB  - The energy crisis has imposed restrictions and caused delays in the construction of large sea water conversion enterprises. For the purpose of improving energy utilization in desalination by thermal processes, a new process is proposed, whose main feature is coupling horizontal tube evaporators with a vacuum freezing unit, thus replacing the conventional final condenser by a lower temperature device. The proposed plant is operated by means of a boiler, whose steam actuates an absorption cycle, to drive the process by delivering the vapors from the freezer into the absorber, where they are directly condensed on a concentrated Lithium Bromide solution. The advantages of the coupled plant are relatively high Economy Ratio of 18 to 20 and operation conditions between 0 degree to 60 degree C, which minimizes corrosion attack.

TI  - Geoengineering, marine microalgae, and climate stabilization in the 21st century
AB  - Society has set ambitious targets for stabilizing mean global temperature. To attain these targets, it will have to reduce CO2 emissions to near zero by mid-century and subsequently remove CO2 from the atmosphere during the latter half of the century. There is a recognized need to develop technologies for CO2 removal; however, attempts to develop direct air-capture systems have faced both energetic and financial constraints. Recently, BioEnergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) has emerged as a leading candidate for removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However, BECCS can have negative consequences on land, nutrient, and water use as well as biodiversity and food production. Here, we describe an alternative approach based on the large-scale industrial production of marine microalgae. When cultivated with proper attention to power, carbon, and nutrient sources, microalgae can be processed to produce a variety of biopetroleum products, including carbon-neutral biofuels for the transportation sector and long-lived, potentially carbon-negative construction materials for the built environment. In addition to these direct roles in mitigating and potentially reversing the effects of fossil CO2 emissions, microalgae can also play an important indirect role. As microalgae exhibit much higher primary production rates than terrestrial plants, they require much less land area to produce an equivalent amount of bioenergy and/or food. On a global scale, the avoided emissions resulting from displacement of conventional agriculture may exceed the benefits of microalgae biofuels in achieving the climate stabilization goals.

TI  - Storm-Driven Hydrodynamic and Sediment logical Impacts to an Engineered Coast
AB  - We replicated a breakwater, seawall, and artificial gravel beach from Marina di Pisa, Italy in a 1:40 scale-model. The model was tested in a wave-current flume that is 50 m long, 0.8 meters wide and high, and located at the University of Florence. The gravel beach, berm, and breakwater models were constructed based upon in situ beach surveys. The laboratory quartz boulder beach and breakwater D-50 approximated 3.0 mm and 3.6 cm, respectively. The laboratory hydrodynamics aimed to simulate a portion of storm measured at a local wave buoy during an event in October 2003 that lasted 54 hours. Ten wave runs were conducted with durations ranging from 9.5 - 43 min with programmed peak wave periods of 1.4 - 2.1 s and significant wave heights of 9.6 - 17.5 cm. Seven wave gauges were distributed along the wave flume, two adjacent to wave maker, three just offshore the breakwater, and two just onshore of the breakwater. The clear glass side of the flume was delineated to capture millimeter scale changes of beach and berm morphology. Wave transmission (K-t) values calculated using field-based measurements ranged from 0.33-0.52, suggesting that between 11-27\% of the offshore energy is transmitted through the breakwater. In the laboratory simulation of the storm, the modeled K-t values under-predicted measured K-t values by 1-16\% and the berm migrated onshore to the upper shoreface and flattened the overall beach profile.

TI  - Numerical investigation of role of angle of attack of duct in ducted propeller with PBCF
AB  - Propeller boss cap fin (PBCF) is a well known energy saving devices (ESD), appreciated by various researchers for their capability of destroying hub vortex. Propeller duct also used for highly loaded propeller vessel due its ability to destroy blade tip vortex. But combined study of PBCF and propeller duct to improve propeller efficiency has not been investigated as per concern. In this paper numerical investigations have been performed to observe significance of duct angle of attack in the combine effect of PBCF and propeller duct. Here 19A duct is combined with aero foil shape PBCF with NACA4412 profile as ESD in VP1304 controllable pitch propeller. For numerical study, angle of attacks are varied for 5Â° interval and three duct models are generated with 0Â°, 5Â° and 10Â° angle of attack. Results shows improvement of propeller efficiency is reducing gradually with the increase of angle of attack and maximum 7.05% efficiency improvement is obtained at 0Â° angle of attack compare to parent propeller. This may be due to restricted flow at the tail section of the duct with the increase of angle of attack. Besides that fluctuation of pressure, various velocity components, formation of vortexes will also be investigated. Â© 2019: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects

The bundles - which consist of a carrier pipe including production and service lines - are built onshore in one length and will be towed out, pulled and connected to the subsea manifolds. A description of dedicated subsea tools which have been engineered and fabricated in order to ensure a diverless installation of these bundles is given. Some specific features have been implemented during design and fabrication of the subsea electrical cables and umbilical. These features, which are further described, will allow for installation and connection of these lines without any diver assistance. Finally, the particular role of the Remote Operated Vehicles which provides a back-up solution on many occasions is outlined. Â© 1988 Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Distribution of microbes in supercritical CO2 extraction of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) oils
AB  - The distribution of vegetative microbial cells and their spores in a supercritical CO, extraction process was studied. The seed and flesh/skin fractions of the press residue of sea buckthorn berries (Hippophae rhamnoides) from a juice factory were used as raw materials. A pilot-scale extraction plant was operated at 30 MPa at temperatures of 40 and 60 degrees C. The number of yeasts, moulds and bacteria in the pulp/skin fraction, in the extraction residues, in the extracted oils as well as in the water phases separated from the extracted oils was estimated by the spread plate technique. The microbial content of the flesh/skin material was increased in some extractions by the addition of bacterial spores. In general, the extraction process led to a decrease in the bacterial count of the extracted material, whereas no microbial growth was detected in the oils extracted or in the water phases separated from them. Neither yeasts nor moulds were found in any samples after the extraction process. The microbial status of seed oil and flesh/skin oil obtained by industrial-scale CO2 extraction at 40 degrees C and at 30 MPa before and after gelatine encapsulation remained unchanged. This proves that supercritical CO2 can be used to manufacture edible oil products free of living micro-organisms and their spores.

TI  - East coast of Canada: An industry perspective on the opportunities and challenges
AB  - The Grand Banks off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada is home to several major offshore oil discoveries. Most notable are the 800+ MMbbl Hibernia and 400+ MMbbl Terra Nova fields, currently in production; the 200+ MMbbl White Rose field, currently under development towards planned start-up in early 2006; and the 500+ MMbbl Hebron field, whose development future is undetermined at this time. All discoveries are in a single producing basin, the Jeanne d'Arc. Since the discovery of Hibernia, there have been predictions that offshore Newfoundland could become the next North Sea. But while the Jeanne d'Arc Basin has proven to be a world-class producing basin, other large discoveries have remained elusive to date. Since the inception of the industry in the North Sea, thousands of exploration and delineation wells have been drilled and hundreds of fields have been developed. During a similar time period, well under 200 exploration or delineation wells have been drilled, and just two fields have entered production on the Grand Banks. While offshore Newfoundland and Labrador has not lived up to its early billing as the next North Sea, the opportunity remains for this region to be a more significant producing area, but probably not at the scale of the North Sea. Petro-Canada operates the Terra Nova field, and has substantial interests in Hibernia, White Rose, Hebron and all but one of the significant hydrocarbon discoveries in the region since 1979. This paper provides one perspective on the development of the Newfoundland offshore area - the considerable environmental, geological, technological and infrastructural challenges, the significant opportunities that are driving continued interest in the region, and the factors for success.

TI  - Analysis of Electrical Distribution System for Offshore Oil and Gas Platform
AB  - The electrical power system of a medium size offshore oil and gas platform is studied by using a power system simulator software, namely ETAP. The load flow and short circuit analyses under various operating conditions are carried out, including normal, service, emergency and black start operation. The operations that generate maximum and minimum fault current magnitudes at the main switchboard and electric submersible pump are calculated, respectively. The protective device coordination is achieved by using the time-current curve tool of ETAP. The component ratings, voltage drop, and protection device setting are evaluated based on the results obtained from these analyses. A modern multifunctional transformer relay is proposed on a 2240kVA 6.6/0.415 kV transformer to provide a comprehensive protection and control. The overcurrent tripping time is reduced by using the combination of instantaneous and time-delay protection functions of the multifunctional transformer relay, hence mitigate the arc flash damages to the system and improve safety for personal. The relay is assessed in the laboratory by using a secondary current injection tester. The result shows that the correctness of the relay setting. The future work includes transformer internal fault studies and testing, and integration of protection systems with plant automation. Â© 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Sustainable renewable energy seawater desalination using combined-cycle solar and geothermal heat sources
AB  - Key goals in the improvement of desalination technology are to reduce overall energy consumption, make the process ``greener,{''} and reduce the cost of the delivered water. Adsorption desalination (AD) is a promising new technology that has great potential to reduce the need for conventional power, to use solely renewable energy sources, and to reduce the overall cost of water treatment. This technology can desalt seawater or water of even higher salinity using waste heat, solar heat, or geothermal heat. An AD system can operate effectively at temperatures ranging from 55 to 80 degrees C with perhaps an optimal temperature of 80 degrees C. The generally low temperature requirement for the feedwater allows the system to operate quite efficiently using an alternative energy source, such as solar power. Solar power, particularly in warm dry regions, can generate a consistent water temperature of about 90 degrees C. Although this temperature is more than adequate to run the system, solar energy collection only can occur during daylight hours, thereby necessitating the use of heat storage during nighttime or very cloudy days. With increasing capacity, the need for extensive thermal storage may be problematic and could add substantial cost to the development of an AD system. However, in many parts of the world, there are subsurface geothermal energy sources that have not been extensively used. Combining a low to moderate geothermal energy recovery system to an AD system would provide a solution to the thermal storage issue. However, geothermal energy development from particularly Hot Dry Rock is limited by the magnitude of the heat flow required for the process and the thermal conductivity of the rock material forming the heat reservoir. Combining solar and geothermal energy using an alternating 12-h cycle would reduce the probability of depleting the heat source within the geothermal reservoir and provide the most effective use of renewable energy.

TI  - Shallow particulate organic carbon regeneration in the South Pacific Ocean
AB  - Particulate organic carbon (POC) produced in the surface ocean sinks through the water column and is respired at depth, acting as a primary vector sequestering carbon in the abyssal ocean. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are sensitive to the length (depth) scale over which respiration converts POC back to inorganic carbon, because shallower waters exchange with the atmosphere more rapidly than deeper ones. However, estimates of this carbon regeneration length scale and its spatiotemporal variability are limited, hindering the ability to characterize its sensitivity to environmental conditions. Here, we present a zonal section of POC fluxes at high vertical and spatial resolution from the GEOTRACES GP16 transect in the eastern tropical South Pacific, based on normalization to the radiogenic thorium isotope Th-230. We find shallower carbon regeneration length scales than previous estimates for the oligotrophic South Pacific gyre, indicating less efficient carbon transfer to the deep ocean. Carbon regeneration is strongly inhibited within suboxic waters near the Peru coast. Canonical Martin curve power laws inadequately capture POC flux profiles at suboxic stations. We instead fit these profiles using an exponential function with flux preserved at depth, finding shallow regeneration but high POC sequestration below 1,000 m. Both regeneration length scales and POC flux at depth closely track the depths at which oxygen concentrations approach zero. Our findings imply that climate warming will result in reduced ocean carbon storage due to expanding oligotrophic gyres, but opposing effects on ocean carbon storage from expanding suboxic waters will require modeling and future work to disentangle.

TI  - A Eulerian-Eulerian physical-biological impact model of zooplankton injury due to CO2 ocean sequestration
AB  - To study the biological impacts of CO2 ocean sequestration on floating marine organisms, a full Eulerian-Eulerian scheme model has been developed in a large-eddy simulation (LES) version using one-way coupling of the equations of seawater flow to the transport equations of the bio-scalar variables. Special attention was paid to deriving the transport equation, involving non-conservative scalars to describe the degree of injury to floating organisms due to the change in the pH environment resulting from CO2 dissolution. The source terms of the transport equations of bio-scalar variables are based on experimental data on zooplankton activities affected by lower pH seawater, allowing construction of empirical sub-models of three kinds of floating marine organisms: Gaidius variabilis, Paraeuchaeta Birostrata, and Multi-organisms. An example is given to show the applicability of the model to the assessment of the biological impact of CO2 sequestration in the ocean. Given an initial CO2 droplet diameter of 8.0 mm and an injection rate of 1.0 kg/sec, the model simulation predicts that the zooplanktons lose approximately 90% of their activity when the lowest pH inside the plume decreases from 7.57 to 5.61. These injured zooplanktons then recovered gradually to their normal state within two hours due to dilution of the plume. Copyright Â© The Oceanographic Society of Japan.

TI  - Deepwater floating production systems in harsh environment - A look at a field development offshore Norway and need for technology qualification
AB  - Deepwater field developments are regarded as standard technology in several areas of the world such as offshore Angola, Brazil and in Gulf of Mexico, but in very harsh environments no deepwater fields are put in production yet. When moving into harsher environment the extreme design loads becomes more challenging, but the increased fatigue loading may be just as important when selecting concept for field development. Especially riser and mooring solutions are vulnerable to the loading conditions in harsh environment. In the present paper key challenges for developing deepwater fields in harsh environment will be addressed. Development solutions that are working very well in more benign environments may not work as required in the deepwater harsh environments offshore Norway and Shetland. Careful reviews must be carried out to assess current technology status and applicability of selected technology in new environment settings. The Aasta Hansteen deepwater field development offshore Norway will be used to illustrate the drivers for the concept selection. Necessary steps to qualify the concept for sanctioning will also be highlighted. Copyright 2013, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Reduction of freshwater usage of a coal fired power plant with CCS by applying a high level of integration of all water streams
AB  - The integration of the recently built 1 070 MW coal-fired unit in Rotterdam (Netherlands) with the proposed new 250 MW demonstration carbon capture unit of the Rotterdam Opslag en Afvang Demonstratieproject (ROAD) would lead to a substantial reduction in freshwater usage. This is partly due to the power plant design, the most relevant features being the seawater direct cooling and the limestone gypsum Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD); and partly due to the high level of integration. This paper describes the water and waste streams of the capture plant, including quality and (re-) use in the power plant. The implications for a full scale capture are discussed.

TI  - The impacts of carbon pricing on maritime transport costs and their implications for developing economies
AB  - We provide an in-depth review of the extant literature on the impact a maritime carbon pricing measure might have on maritime transport costs. First, we analyse the relative importance of the determinants of maritime transport costs for trade and economic development, and secondly assess the transmission channels and economic effects of a carbon price on maritime transport costs. We argue that the introduction of a carbon price has a limited impact on total maritime transport costs for the average country. However, Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries are more likely to be negatively impacted by such a measure in terms of maritime transport costs as we provide novel evidence that the relationship between per unit transport costs and trade flows is negative and elastic at least for the case of Pacific Small Island Developing States.

TI  - Integrated underreamer technology with real-time communication helpedeliminate rathole in exploratory operation offshore nigeria
AB  - This paper describes the successful deployment of integrated underreamer technology with real-timecommunication through mud-pulse telemetry system, to drill and eliminate rathole in 17 1/2-in Ã— 20-insuccessfully in one run and helped set casing as close as possible to the depth of suspected pressure rampon an exploratory well offshore Nigeria. This technology uses the same communication system (actuatorbypass) as Measurement While Drilling tools (MWD),Logging While Drilling tools (LWD) and RotarySteerable System (RSS). Integrated underreamers broadly used in the drilling operations support optimized casing and completionprograms and helps reduce operational risks such as wellbore instability. The ball drop and hydraulicallyactivated reamer technologies available today comes with limitations and HSE risks. The distinctivefunctionalities of the integrated underreamer technology described here, such as unlimited and fastactivation and deactivation via downlinking and real time downhole feedback,reduce uncertainties andoperational costs in the complex and challenging deep offshore drilling operations. The real-time communication through mud-pulse telemetry system enabled the placement of integratedunderreamer 6 meters from the bit thereby reducing rathole length to approximately 9 meters compared to 80meters for conventional underreamer application. The integrated underreamer is compatible with existingRSS and provide unlimited activation cycles. The integrated underreamer offers flexibility in placement inthe bottom hole assembly (BHA) and it can be used as a near bit reamer, or as main reamer or as both.Inthis case,the integrated near bit underreamer eliminated the need for a dedicated rathole removal run.It alsooffered a feedback confirmation of the cutter blades activation status and provided hole opening log therebyreducing the operational uncertainties for the under reaming, saving rig time up to 16 hours for shoulder test. The underreamer was successfully deployed to drill and ream the challenging 14 Ã— 17 and ream17 Ã— 20'' section offshore Nigeria. Both sections were drilled and reamed to section Total Depth (TD) inone run with all directional requirements and Measurement While Drilling (MWD)/Logging While Drilling(LWD) met,saving client approximately 4 days of rig spread cost. The reamer appeared to provide an in-gauge borehole allowing for successful running and cementing of liners without any issues, demonstratingsuperior borehole quality.The new Technology proved to be a reliable and flexible hole enlargement whiledrilling solution that help to improve drilling performance, reduce operational risks and save cost.

TI  - Seismic monitoring for subsurface uncertainties at the Endurance CO2 store
AB  - The development of the Endurance structure in the southern North Sea as a CO2 store offers a potentially large decarbonization opportunity for industry along the east coast of England. The Bunter Sandstone Formation in the Endurance structure has been assessed as an excellent candidate for CO2 storage due to its position, depth, reservoir properties, and extensive seal. Monitoring CO2 during active injection and after closure is vital to confirming containment and conformance of the CO2 within the store. There are two key subsurface uncertainties: compartmentalization and vertical permeability. Current seismic resolution does not provide imaging of thin, low-permeability layers that may create low relative vertical permeability, and the high net to gross of the sandstone limits imaging of any minor faulting. However, the strong CO2 response on 4D seismic likely will illuminate baffles and barriers to flow along with variations in reservoir permeability. In 2020, four two-dimensional high-resolution (2DHR) seismic data test lines were acquired to assess the best technology for imaging and monitoring Endurance. High-resolution seismic was concluded to provide quality imaging from the base of the reservoir (approximately 1500 m true vertical depth subsea) up through the overburden to image the entire subsurface and to demonstrate safe storage of CO2.

TI  - DOE-ANOVA to Optimize Hydrokinetic Turbines for Low Velocity Conditions
AB  - The need of reducing the dependence of fossil fuels and CO2 emissions have motivated the diversification of energy matrix. Among the Renewables, the hydropower shows better characteristics compared to solar, wind, biomass and geothermal, because its low CO2 emissions, higher density and others technical factors. Within the Hydropower, the Hydrokinetic turbines (HT) are considered as a promising technology because can provide electricity during low flow velocity conditions (&lt; 2 m/s) and is able to operate in shallow waters &lt; 8 m and in secluded areas without access to the energy network. In this sense, the present study incentivizes the research in Hydropower and proposes and new application of DOE-ANOVA combined with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling for the HT design and optimization. Accordingly, this work evaluated the performance of a HT with 1.9 m of rotor diameter operating in a water flow of 1.5 m/s through a 23 factorial design with 9 modelling cases (MC). The results showed that the increment of outlet diameters increased the downstream velocity and the hydrodynamic pressure over the HT, and the reduction of the blade tip edge distance generated an increment of the response of the HT hydraulic and mechanical properties.

TI  - Offshore structures, sea mud accumulation and mangrove regeneration: Insights from the Vietnamese Mekong Delta, Vietnam
AB  - Offshore structures have been prioritized for controlling eroded muddy coasts, particularly in Southeast Asia. However, these structures have had limited accumulation of sea mud and a low level of mangrove regeneration. The reality shows that sea mud accumulation and mangrove regeneration greatly contribute to controlling erosion and establishing muddy coasts. Little is known as to how sea mud accumulation and mangrove regeneration have been integrated or referred to during designing and construction of offshore structures. I used construction of offshore structures along the Vietnamese Mekong Delta coast for answering the above question. This study was undertaken using critical review of the technical designs, semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders, analysis of satellite images and field measurements in pursuit of the objectives. The results show that sea mud accumulation and mangrove regeneration were not adequately considered by the design and construction of offshore structures. Attenuation of the wave energy and the transplantation were prioritized instead. Physical visibility and survival of interventions were two criteria used for designing the structure. Until now, most sites have been still in liquid sediment. Nether sea mud accumulation nor mangrove regeneration were recorded. The findings provide a technical reference to redesigning current offshore structures to improve their efficacy in accumulating sea mud and promoting mangrove regeneration in the region and in Southeast Asia in the future.

TI  - Robust Islanded Restoration Coordinating Multiple Distributed Resources to Enhance Resilience of Active Distribution System
AB  - On the background of high penetration of renewable resources, the multiple distributed energy resources, e.g., wind turbines, photovoltaic units, electric vehicles, and energy storage systems pose challenges to the operation of the grid utility due to the uncertainty and intermittency. From the perspective of service restoration after a blackout, this paper proposes a robust islanded restoration strategy to cope with the uncertainty of wind and photovoltaic units aiming to enhance the resilience of active distribution system. Moreover, the electric vehicles are dispatched as emergency resources to support service restoration. A three-layer robust islanded restoration mathematical model in the form of min-max-min is established which ensures the minimum load shedding in the worst scenario of wind and photovoltaic units. In the first layer, operators determine the range of each islanded microgrid and the position of each emergency electric vehicle. In the second layer, the worst scenario is searched. The third layer tries to find the minimum load shedding strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and strategy are verified by the simulations on a modified PGE-69 distribution system. Â© 2019 IEEE.

TI  - The Role of Zooplankton in Establishing Carbon Export Regimes in the Southern Ocean - A Comparison of Two Representative Case Studies in the Subantarctic Region
AB  - Marine ecosystems regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by transporting and storing photosynthetically fixed carbon in the ocean's interior. In particular, the subantarctic and polar frontal zone of the Southern Ocean is a significant region for physically driven carbon uptake due to mode water formation, although it is under-studied concerning biologically mediated uptake. Regional differences in iron concentrations lead to variable carbon export from the base of the euphotic zone. Contrary to our understanding of export globally, where high productivity results in high export, naturally iron-fertilized regions exhibit low carbon export relative to their surface productivity, while HNLC (High Nutrient, Low Chlorophyll) waters emerge as a significant area for carbon export. Zooplankton, an integral part of the oceanic food web, play an important role in establishing these main carbon export regimes. In this mini review, we explore this role further by focusing on the impact of grazing and the production of fecal pellets on the carbon flux. The data coverage in the subantarctic region will be assessed by comparing two case studies - the iron-replete Kerguelen Plateau and the HNLC region south of Australia. We then discuss challenges in evaluating the contributions of zooplankton to carbon flux, namely gaps in seasonal coverage of sampling campaigns, the use of non-standardized and biased methods and under-sampling of the mesopelagic zone, an important area of carbon remineralization. More integrated approaches are necessary to improve present estimates of zooplankton-mediated carbon export in the Southern Ocean.

TI  - A completion system application for the world's first marine hydrate production test
AB  - The world's first subsea methane hydrate completion system was installed and its production test successfully executed in the eastern Nankai Trough area off the east coast of central Japan in March 2013. A variety of methane hydrate production methods exist and have been recognized by the industry as being feasible in producing methane hydrate from the view point of geology, geophysics, petrophysics and reservoir/production engineering. This paper describes one of these methods and provides some background and detailed engineering required in the development of a completion design, the interface and qualification testing necessary to mitigate some key challenges and risks associated in the development of a methane hydrate completion and production system. The completion system demonstrated in this paper utilizes an Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP) in conjunction with real-time downhole monitoring whilst producing separated fluid and gas flow streams to surface, combining natural and artificial separation methods. The objective of this paper is to present the application of the completion system in a methane hydrate production well by the depressurization method. It will review the completion system and key production string component, as well as the lessons learned from the production test. Copyright 2014, Offshore Technology Conference.

In this regard, this work reviews all the technologies capable of performing electrolysis at sea. The review includes a thorough description and explanation of all known possible damages to the different electrolysis technologies caused by the impurities that may be present in water sourcing from the sea. In addition, this work studies three different hypothetic plants based on the reviewed technologies, to produce hydrogen at 350 bar for its transportation in compressed state. The study is aimed to make an energetic and environmental comparison. The results show that low-temperature electrolysis technologies are currently the best possible candidates regarding both sustainability and durability, with an estimated specific energy to produce hydrogen at 350 bar of 175 MJ/kg under a steady state operation.

TI  - PERFORMANCE OF GEOGRID REINFORCED FILL AT INNER LAYER OF THE RUBBLE-MOUND BREAKWATER
AB  - One of the most common and most conventional way to protecting a coastal area from excessive wave action is built rubble mound breakwaters. Main cost of the breakwater construction is due to the supply and transport costs of very heavy rocks from the quarries to the construction sites or built artificial blocks such as tetrapods, cubes, antifers. Usually, rubble-mound breakwaters consist of a single or double rows armor layer, one or more inner layer filled with relatively smaller size rocks, and of an impermeable core part. In this study, geogrid application in breakwaters as an inner layer and their efficiency from the stability point of view was experimentally studied. The aim of the study was to investigate the performance of geogrid as an alternative for one or two-layer inner zones in breakwaters in order to ensure an easier construction and more economical solution.

TI  - Leaching tests as useful tools to characterised contaminated marine sediments mobility under CO 2 leakages from CCS technology
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been gaining attention as a climate change mitigation option. However, the potential impact of possible CO 2 leakages on the marine sediments and the sea environment is an important consideration for the application of these techniques. The analysis, modeling, and assessment of the mobility of substances from sediments in contact with acidified seawater by CO 2 leakages could be done by leaching tests. The effect of different type of water, i.e., deionized water, seawater, and acidified seawater, on leaching data was studied. The pollutant release was evaluated as a function of pH. The release in batch and column tests were compared as a function of liquid-solid ratio. The mechanisms of the leaching tests were elucidated. This is an abstract of a paper presented at the 7th European Congress of Chemical Engineering-7 and 19th International Congress of Chemical and Process Engineering CHISA 2010 (Prague, Czech Republic 8/28/2010-9/1/2010).

TI  - Ecological roles of zoosporic parasites in blue carbon ecosystems
AB  - Pathosystems describe the relationships between parasites, hosts and the environment. Generally these systems remain in a dynamic equilibrium over time. In this review we examine some of the evidence for the potential impacts of change in dynamic equilibrium in blue carbon ecosystems and the relationships to the amount of stored carbon. Blue carbon ecosystems are marine and estuarine ecosystems along the coasts. Virulent pathogens can be introduced into ecosystems along with non-native hosts. Alteration of environmental conditions, such as temperature, pH and salinity, may cause parasites to dominate the pathosystems resulting in significant decreases in productivity and population sizes of producer hosts and in changes in the overall species composition and function in these ecosystems. Such changes in blue carbon ecosystems may result in accelerated release of carbon dioxide back into the ocean and atmosphere, which could then drive further changes in the global climate. The resiliency of these ecosystems is not known. However, recent evidence suggests that significant proportions of blue carbon ecosystems have already disappeared.

TI  - What's new in production: CO2-based EOR in the UK
AB  - A DTI report, "Implementing a demonstration of Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) using carbon dioxide", was published in early April 2004. The report fulfills DIT's commitment in the Energy White Paper to "set up an urgent detailed implementation plan with developers and oil producers to establish what needs to be done to get a demonstration project going". The main conclusions from the report are: under existing current market conditions, there is little interest in CO2-based EOR among North Sea oil producers; CO-based EOR remains a potential option for demonstrating CO2 capture and storage (CCS), which is central to development of near-zero emissions fossil fuel combustion plants; and DTI is reviewing its strategy for development of a near-zero emission fossil fuel plant, and CO2-based EOR will be further considered within this strategy. CCS is attracting much international interest as a technique for making major reductions in CO2 greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to use fossil fuels.

TI  - Enhancing safety in offshore well control by applying intelligent drillpipe
AB  - One of the major concerns in drilling operations is gas kick detection and blow out control. If not detected early or properly controlled, gas kicks could be disastrous. Loss of human lives, polluting the environment (especially in deep offshore drilling) and financial losses are possible consequences of a blowout. Despite significant enhancements in offshore drilling technology, still conventional well control indicators are applied for gas kick detection in most of the offshore wells. These indicators are rudimentary and are not sufficiently reliable for drilling costly offshore wells. Now, having access to continuous pressure data along the wellbore at very high rate and independent of drilling fluid type is offered by mounting pressure sensors on intelligent (wired) drillpipe. One of the most important applications of this new technology. However, in order to apply this technology for early gas detection, variations in annular pressure profile during entering gas influx to the wellbore should be precisely predicted. To accomplish this goal, different involved regions are modeled and a numerical scheme and a transient gas kick simulator are developed to solve the equations. Simulator is validated with available two-phase experimental data (air-water) from a vertical flow loop (3 in X 1.66 in, 52.5 ft long) at The University of Tulsa. Based on the analysis of simulated annular pressure profile, ethodologies are developed for early kick detection and determining its location for different drilling scenarios. Obtained results indicate that during entrance of gas influx in Constant Bottomhole Pressure Technique of Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD), pressure at all sensors increases simultaneously. This criterion can be used for early detection of gas influx; furthermore, determination of influx location is conducted by monitoring variations in pressure derivative curve at each sensor. For this MPD technique, when gas influx reaches a certain sensor, pressure derivative starts to decline.

TI  - Use of the moving frame method in dynamics to model gyroscopic control of small crafts at sea: Theory - Part 1
AB  - This paper presents new method in dynamics-the Moving Frame Method (MFM)-and uses it to address a challenge faceing Norwegian shipping. Large offshore renewable energy investments require the use of maintenance boats to keep them in operable conditions. Unfortunately, due to rough seas in some project locations, the transferring of crew members from vessel to turbine or platform is fraught with safety concerns. These concerns can be alleviated by controlling the motion of the transfer vessel. This research studies an add-on stability system for marine vessels to ease the process of offshore platform maintenance and crew member safety. Specifically, this research concerns an internal active system-an active gyroscopic stabilizer-and a more powerful method of theoretical and computational mechanics. This paper derives the equations of motion of a model system equipped with dual gyroscopic stabilizers, using the MFM. The equations of motion are numerically solved to obtain a numerical simulation. The method exploits a variational principle with a restricted variation of the angular velocity. The MFM simplifies dynamics, enables a consistent notation, from 2D to 3D analysis and exploits matrix algebra in lieu of the vector cross product. Finally, in a companion paper to this one, the mathematical model and the numerical simulation is verified with experiments conducted in a large-scale wave tank. Â© 2017 ASME.

TI  - Ocean renewable energy and its prospect for developing economies
AB  - OceanÂ  Renewable Energy (ORE) is a comparatively new and relatively unexplored source of clean energy. Oceans have considerable potential for mechanical, thermal, and chemical energy that can help mitigate global climate change by reducing carbon emissions from the use of fossil fuels. Technologies are available for tidal current, wave, thermal, and salinity gradient energy. Developed countries like France, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States are the global leaders of technologies and installation. Developing economies, such as China, India, Brazil, and Indonesia are also adopting ORE projects in recent years. However, there are several potential adverse impacts of ORE plants including injury and mortality of marine mammals and benthic community, damage and dislocation of their habitats, and change of shoreline, which can contradict with global commitment toward conservation and ensuring sustainable utilization of the oceans and marine resources according to Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs). Since developing countries are striving toward increasing the share of renewable in their energy portfolio in which ORE would be a stable and predictable source of energy especially for coastal communities and isolated small island developing states. Improving the design of the technologies is imperative to minimize negative impacts on marine ecosystems and the environment. There is a need for community endorsement of renewable energy projects through consultation and revenue sharing for achieving sustainability. Investment should be increased on research and development for reducing capital cost while enabling policies, institutions, budgeting, and strengthening regional and international cooperation are also required for greater adoption of ORE technologies by developing economies. This chapter highlighted and discussed all these issues in brief. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characterizing Sockeye Salmon Smolt Interactions with a Hydrokinetic Turbine in the Kvichak River, Alaska
AB  - The development of hydrokinetic turbines has been motivated by the desire to reduce fossil fuel reliance, energy production costs, and greenhouse gas emissions. Detailed information about fish interactions with hydrokinetic turbines is limited; therefore, this study sought to characterize the interactions between a turbine (RivGen; Ocean Renewable Power Company) and Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka from one of the most productive populations in the worldâ€”that in the Kvichak River, Alaska. By viewing real-time video imagery, our objectives were to quantify the number of Sockeye Salmon smolts that interacted with the turbine and to assess the behaviors/outcomes of these interactions during the species' smolt out-migration. From May 21 to June 10, 2021, a total of 2,374 Sockeye Salmon smolts passed through the field of view of cameras placed immediately downstream of the hydrokinetic turbine. The majority of these observed events occurred over a short (5-d) time period from late May to early June during periods of darkness (0000â€“0400 hours). Fish were observed passing through the hydrokinetic turbine in both normal and disoriented manners, with the rotational status/speed of the hydrokinetic turbine appearing to influence passage behavior. Blade strikes on fish were also observed, all of which occurred when the turbine was rotating at high â€œproductionâ€ speeds. After temporally and spatially extrapolating the observed fish interactions to account for our subsampling, the results suggest that when monitoring was conducted, the hydrokinetic turbine interacted with approximately 200,000 Sockeye Salmon smolts during this species' smolt out-migration period. This study adds to the sparse knowledge base on fish interactions with emerging riverine hydrokinetic devices and may inform strategies to mitigate the impacts of developing energy projects on socially and culturally important fisheries.

TI  - Lahat BWRO plant: technical and economic evaluation of energy recovery alternatives
AB  - The Lahat BWRO plant was constructed as part of the southern Israel coastal aquifer rehabilitation project. Two RO trains, with a capacity of 10,000m(3)/d each, were commissioned in August 2010. In both trains a turbocharger (TC) energy recovery device was installed, wherein the turbine side utilizes the energy of the second stage brine to boost the second stage feed. Lahat plant expansion with two additional 11,300m(3)/d BWRO trains is currently under construction. As part of the pre-design phase, a techno-economic analysis was conducted with the purpose of finding the most cost-effective energy recovery configuration. Comparing existing design of TC added with a booster pump with alternative isobaric energy recovery with ERI PX devices, it was shown that implementation of isobaric PX results in a life cycle saving of 1,091,882\$, about 1.5 times more than the TC alternative. Accordingly, in the design of the two additional RO units, isobaric energy recovery device was implemented. Apart from the cost benefit, this configuration has several advantages versus the TC, mainly the control of the second stage booster pressure with increased accuracy and flexibility. This enables a better balance of the first and second stage flux in comparison with TC option. The current paper includes an introduction about the southern Israel coastal aquifer rehabilitation project, and the construction plan of the Gat, Granot, and Lahat brackish water RO BWRO desalination plants. In addition, it presents the complexity of the marine brine disposal pipeline of these inland plants, and the rational that led to the innovative idea of energy recovery in the Lahat BWRO plant. Finally, the technical and economic considerations of energy recovery alternatives in BWRO plants are discussed and summarized.

TI  - Influence of Sea Water Ingression on Carbon Sequestration in Soils Under Coastal Agro-ecosystems of Eastern India
AB  - Coastal agro-ecosystem covers a good part of Earthâ€™s land cover, and the recent global warming-related sea-level rise may further extend its coverage. We assessed the ability of such agro-ecosystem for stocking organic C. To reveal the reasons thereof, soils were collected from three ecologies along east coast of India. It was observed that soils that experienced occasional visits by sea water were a better niche for organic C. Formation of bigger-sized soil aggregates that occlude organic C and protect it from microbial oxidation, migration of organic C towards relatively recalcitrant pools by attachment of its de-protonated â€“COO groups onto soil mineral surfaces, besides subdued microbial activity due to salinity, contributed longer persistence to organic C and thus its enrichment in coastal soils. Results suggested that occasional visits of salt-laden sea water to coastal agro-ecosystem might curb C loss from soils and thus CO2 loading in the atmosphere and hence the phenomenon of global warming.

TI  - Numerical prediction of the dilution process and its biological impacts in CO2 ocean sequestration
AB  - In order to investigate the biological impacts of the ocean sequestration of CO2 (carbon dioxide), the dilution processes of CO2 were investigated near injection points in the deep ocean. From a combined fluid-dynamics, chemical, and biological approach, a two-phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method with mass transfer was developed to predict droplet plume flow, the dissolution of CO2 from droplets into seawater, and the advection-diffusion of dissolved CO2 (DCO2) in the deep ocean. Changes in pH due to the concentration of DCO2 were also calculated. In addition, the isomortality concept of Auerbach et al. was incorporated to predict the lethal damage to marine organisms caused by DCO2. The simulation results suggested that the biological impacts of CO2 sequestration were insignificant in terms of mortality in both small-scale field experiments and the real-life cases we propose.

TI  - The Semisubmersible Floating Production System: From Argyll to Appomattox
AB  - This paper is part of the special OTC session "Floating Memories-Look Back to Leap Forward" intended as a historic retrospective of the evolution of the four major types of floating production platforms: Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO), Semisubmersible (FPS), Tension Leg Platform (TLP) and Spar, from their inception to the present day. The session includes a look ahead to the future of these floating platforms and what it will take to sustain their commercial viability as they adapt to headwinds from continuous volatility of oil and gas prices and competition from onshore tight oil projects. This paper's focus is the Semisubmersible Floating Production System (FPS). It chronicles the forty five year progression of FPS technology from its humble beginnings in 1975 as a converted Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) deployed on the Argyll field in the North Sea in 80 m of water, to Appomattox, the most recent FPS, that began production in 2019 in 2250 m of water in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) (Figure 1). It also touches briefly on the evolution of the FPS hull, mooring and riser systems and addresses future trends and prospects. Â© 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Does Telemedical Support of First Responders Improve Guideline Adherence in an Offshore Emergency Scenario? A Simulator-Based Prospective Study
AB  - Objective To investigate, in a simulator-based prospective study, whether telemedical support improves quality of emergency first response (performance) by medical non-professionals to being non-inferior to medical professionals. Setting In a simulated offshore wind power plant, duos (teams) of offshore engineers and teams of paramedics conducted the primary survey of a simulated patient. Participants 38 offshore engineers and 34 paramedics were recruited by the general email invitation. Intervention Teams (randomised by lot) were supported by transmission technology and a remote emergency physician in Berlin. Outcome measures From video recordings, performance (17 item checklist) and required time (up to 15 min) were quantified by expert rating for analysis. Differences were analysed using two-sided exact Mann-Whitney U tests for independent measures, non-inferiority was analysed using Schuirmann one-sided test. The significance level of 5 % was Holm-Bonferroni adjusted in each family of pairwise comparisons. Results Nine teams of engineers with, nine without, nine teams of paramedics with and eight without support completed the task. Two experts quantified endpoints, insights into rater dependence were gained. Supported engineers outperformed unsupported engineers (p<0.01), insufficient evidence was found for paramedics (p=0.11). Without support, paramedics outperformed engineers (p<0.01). Supported engineers' performance was non-inferior (at one item margin) to that by unsupported paramedics (p=0.03). Supported groups were slower than unsupported groups (p<0.01). Conclusions First response to medical emergencies in offshore wind farms with substantially delayed professional care may be improved by telemedical support. Future work should test our result during additional scenarios and explore interdisciplinary and ecosystem aspects of this support. Trial registration number DRKS00014372.

TI  - A comparison of two seawater adaptation strategies for Atlantic salmon post-smolt (Salmo salar) grown in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS): Nitrification, water and gut microbiota, and performance of fish
AB  - The land-based production phase in Norwegian Atlantic salmon farming has the past years been extended to include post-smolt for an increasing number of farmers. Post-smolt production can involve introduction of brackish/seawater to a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) that is acclimatized to freshwater for the earlier stages of salmon production. A change from freshwater to seawater shifts the environmental conditions for fish, bacteria and water treatment processes in RAS. Two regimes for salinity increase were studied to evaluate the effects on nitrification functionality, water and gut microbiota and fish performance on land and in the sea cages. A fish group of 200,000 salmon parr were stocked in a brackish water RAS (bRAS) at 3 parts per thousand salinity. After the fish had smoltified the group was split in two, one group was kept in bRAS and the other was moved to a RAS operated at 28 parts per thousand salinity (sRAS). The bRAS was operated with a gradual increase in salinity from 3 to 26\%o over a period of 28 days, whereafter both groups were moved to two separate sea cages. Bacterial communities of water, biofilter biofilm and fish faeces were characterized by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Nitrification capacity tests at different salinities were performed on biofilter media from bRAS, to evaluate short term robustness to salinity changes. Ordination based on Bray-Curtis similarities showed that in water samples in bRAS, the bacterial communities were stable from 12 to 26 parts per thousand salinity increase. The faecal microbiota of the fish showed high inter-individual variation within fish tanks, suggesting stochastic processes/drift to affect the community structures in addition to salinity increase. The same nitrifying bacteria were present in bRAS (throughout the salinity increase) and in sRAS, showing that these nitrifiers could adapt to salinities from 3 to 26 parts per thousand, and 28 parts per thousand. After the sea cage phase, fish from the sRAS system had in total 2.9\% higher weight than the fish from bRAS, however the mortality was 15\% higher in the sRAS group. Salinity was a driver for succession in RAS, and other factors such as organic load in the water and stochastic processes in the host also affected the bacterial community dynamics.

TI  - Pore structure and diffusion characteristics of intact and tectonic coals: Implications for selection of CO2 geological sequestration site
AB  - With the increasing amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, geologic sequestration becomes a promising measure to reduce the rising concentration of CO2. During the process of CO2 injection into coal seam to store CO2, it is critical to select the appropriate coal seam. In order to study whether the intact or tectonic coal is more suitable for CO2 geological sequestration, the pore structure characteristics and fractal dimensions of these coal samples were analyzed by mercury intrusion porosimetry, N-2 (77 K)/CO2 (273 K) adsorption methods, and methane adsorption and diffusion properties of these coal samples were obtained. The results show that tectonic coals have greater pore volume and specific surface area of micropore, mesopore and macropore, while the fractal dimensions of the tectonic coals are smaller (that is, simpler pore structure, smaller pore surface roughness) than that of the intact coals, indicating that tectonic coal has more favorable pore structure to provide more adsorption sites for CO2 storage. Furthermore, better connectivity as well as the adsorption and diffusion capacity of tectonic coals have been significantly improved compared to intact coals, which indicates that CO2 is easier to migrate into the internal pore system of tectonic coal in a short time, reducing the time consumed by CO2 injection into the coal seam, thus saving the cost of CO2 storage. Interestingly, a fractal conceptual model is proposed to account for the evolution of original long and complex pores were converted into short and simple pores, and closed pores transformed into connectivity pores during the formation of tectonic coals. Therefore, the results of this study contribute to understand the advantages of tectonic coal reservoirs as target sites for CO2 geological sequestration.

TI  - The interplay of temperature and algal enrichment intensifies bioturbation of the intertidal amphipod Corophium volutator
AB  - Bioturbation is a central transport process for ecosystem functioning, especially in large soft sediment habitats like the Wadden Sea. The amphipod C. volutator is a dominant bioturbator in the Wadden Sea, due to its great abundance and almost continuous particle movement. Expedition or loss of its bioturbation activity could thus hold ramifications for ecosystem functioning within sediments, like carbon sequestration and nutrient recycling. Here we test the effect that temperature and organic enrichment have on the bioturbation of C. volutator; two prevalent abiotic factors in the Corophiid's habitat that have fluctuated over recent decades, and are expected to change in the future. In-situ experiments were conducted under 8 and 15 Â°C, with varying levels (0 g, 0.1 g, and 0.2 g) of powdered Ulva compressa enriching cores containing C. volutator. We found a significant interaction effect of temperature and organic enrichment on the bioturbation rate of the amphipod, with bioturbation only increasing with added organic enrichment at 15 Â°C. Further, a threshold within our experiments was also reached under 15 Â°C, where the amphipod ceased to expedite bioturbation under higher organic enrichment. This upper limit on this dominant bioturbation imposed with organic enrichment emphasizes the sensitivity of C. volutator. Our findings reveal bioturbation can be limited by temperature in colder months, and opposingly, limited by organic enrichment under warmer conditions. In future Wadden Sea scenarios where temperature is predicted to be warmer and winters milder, enhanced bioturbation activity by C. volutator could prove crucial in continued ecosystem functions.

TI  - Deep ocean water resources in the 21st century
AB  - Artificial upwelling could enhance the ocean food web and help restore depleted marine life at all trophic levels. The primary technical challenge of artificial upwelling is devising site-specific strategies to retain as much of the nutrients contained in deep ocean water at higher concentrations than the background for as long as possible in the photic zone. Recent experiments and analyses have helped to move the concept forward, but substantial work remains to be undertaken. Here, we discuss some long-time-horizon, large-scale concepts involving utilization of deep ocean water for energy and mariculture that could require or result in the geo-engineering of large areas in the ocean.

TI  - Adding to the geothermal energy portfolio from deep sedimentary basins
AB  - Five regions of deep sedimentary rock and hot temperatures (>130Â°C) exist within the State of Texas, and have the potential for developing electrical power. These include the Gulf Coast, East Texas area, the Delaware-Val Verde Basins, the Anadarko Basin in the Texas Panhandle, and the Trans-Pecos region. The Gulf Coast has hosted a successful geothermal power plant, proving that existing technology can generate electricity within an oil and gas-producing province. Estimates of electrical generation within the Gulf Coast and Delaware-VaI Verde Basins alone are at least 6,900 MW based on past and ongoing investigations. Finally, the resource value may easily reach into the tens of billions of dollars, an amount that can begin to rival the existing Texas oil and gas industry.

TI  - Electrical power infrastructure and control solutions for subsea electrically heat-traced flowline pipe-in-pipe EHTF PiP system
AB  - This paper describes the electrical power infrastructure including high voltage and low voltage power transformers, switchboards, distribution units and their associated connection and protection systems required to power a subsea EHTF installation. It discusses the options considered for both topsides and subsea electrical power infrastructure, their integrity monitoring and methods of fault protection. The low power EHTF PiP system, developed by Subsea 7 and ITP InTerPipe, typically requires a subsea supply operating voltage of lkVrms phase to neutral at the flowline start and the requirement to supply multiple heating wires arranged in subsets of three phase circuits, typically 12. This voltage sits at the challenging intersection of normal industry low voltage (<lkV) and high voltage standards (>1.8kV) and thus relevant clauses have to be selected to fit the qualification purpose of the full EHTF PiP system. This voltage can be supplied from either local or remote topsides facilities bringing with them the option of multiple power circuits direct from topsides to subsea or alternatively using a subsea distribution/splitting system. The electrical power system needs to be able to either adjust the applied voltage, the time applied or the number of heating elements in order to control the power required by the pipeline heating system for different production scenarios and redundancy purposes. It also needs full integrity monitoring and appropriate fault clearance facilities that can operate for the local and remote topsides solutions and operate successfully on long umbilicals and EHTF lengths up to ca. 30 km from a single power feed. There may be multiple power feeds on longer lines (Cherkaoui 2016). Instead of complex phase control systems, a simple heating control, using contactors on individual circuits in the local topsides option provides sufficient EHTF heat control. Whereas the addition of subsea fuse modules and/or solid state relay modules (SSR) in the remote topsides option can provide individual subsea circuit isolation and protection. The benefits and drawbacks of different power transformer arrangements are reviewed with available topsides electrical network (power balance/voltages/redundancy). Integrity monitoring and fault protection for local and remote topsides options are reviewed; specifically, the application of line insulation monitoring systems and residual current protection devices.

TI  - Towards commercialization: Challenges in scaling up lab scale membrane for field performance evaluation
AB  - Membrane technology is favorable for bulk CO2 removal from natural gas due to several advantages such as simple operation, no chemical or moving parts, smaller footprint and weight over other technologies, and high reliability. It has led to massive fundamental research efforts in producing better membrane performance throughout the world. However, scaling up the lab scale membrane for field performance evaluation can be quite challenging. The challenges include consistency in membrane quality for large volume process, membrane module design and fabrication techniques, harsh operating conditions with field contaminants fluctuation, and process facilities requirement for offshore application. All the scale up challenges will need to be properly addressed diligently in order to ensure the membrane can be successfully applied as per the intended field specification.

TI  - Active Power Filtering Solution for Improving Power Quality in Cold Ironed Electric Ships
AB  - Climate change is always a concern in the shipping sector, and there is a constant effort in the international shipping community to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The public transportation and commercial vehicle sectors have already begun implementing electric vehicles to meet the emission reduction requirements that are being put in place around the world. It is time that the commercial shipping sector joined them by working towards the electrification of ships and possibly using large batteries as fuel. However, there are some concerns with the ability to charge batteries during long voyages and the weight addition that large batteries would bring. One way to reduce GHG emissions in port is by cold ironing a ship or plugging in a ship to an onshore power source instead of using onboard diesel generators when ships are at port. This is effective because the main propulsion does not need power while in port. However, to ensure that the integrity of the onshore grid is not affected by this additional heavy load that may arise from the loads onboard the vessel, these loads must be analyzed before connecting them to the onshore grid. In this paper, to address these issues, this paper aims to investigate the power quality of the distribution side of TN General Rudder, a Texas A\&M University Galveston's owned ship. Based on the distribution system's harmonics content and power quality, the authors propose an active filter on the secondary side to reduce the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). The proposed filter results in a decrease of 90\% total harmonic distortion, leading to increased efficiency and system performance. Further, the impact of load on the onboard diesel generator and the onshore electrical grid is also examined.

TI  - A Novel Approach for the Biological Desalination of Major Anions in Seawater Using Three Microalgal Species: A Kinetic Study
AB  - The global water shortage alert has been upgraded to a higher risk level. Consequently, a sustainable approach for ecofriendly, energy efficient water desalination is required for agricultural and municipal water reuse. In this study, an energy-efficient biological desalination process was used to treat chloride anions, which are the most abundant anion salt in seawater. Three algal species were studied: Scenedismus arcuatusa (S. arcuatusa), Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris), and Spirulina maxima (Sp. maxima), under different operating conditions (saline concentrations, contact time, high light intensity, and CO2 supply), and two kinetic models were used. It was identified that under a high light intensity and CO2 supply, S. arcuatusa enhanced chloride removal from 32.42 to 48.93\%; the daily bioaccumulation capacity (Q(e)), according to the kinetic models, was enhanced from 124 to 210 mg/g/day; and the net biomass production was enhanced from 0.02 to 0.740 g/L. The EDX analysis proved that salt bioaccumulation may be attributed to the replacement of Ca2+ and Mg2+ with Na+ and K+ through algal cells. The study's findings provide promising data that can be used in the search for novel energy-efficient alternative ecofriendly desalination technologies based on algae biological systems with biomass byproducts that can be reused in a variety of ways.

TI  - Membrane development and energy analysis of freeze desalination-vacuum membrane distillation hybrid systems powered by LNG regasification and solar energy
AB  - The feasibility of an energy-efficient hybrid system consisting of freeze desalination and vacuum membrane distillation (FD-VMD) powered by waste energy and solar energy for seawater desalination was investigated in this study. FD, being the first step, was used to harvest clean ice by freezing the simulated seawater. To ensure the purity of the product ice, the raw ice was washed by about one-half of the VMD distillate. To treat 1 kg seawater by FD, the cold energy could be provided by the regasification process of 1.26 kg LNG. The concentrated FD brine was further treated by VMD to increase the total water recovery. The membranes used in VMD were tri-bore PVDF hollow fiber membranes. The green solvent, triethyl phosphate, was for the first time used to fabricate membranes with such a geometry. The resultant membrane had an optimum permeation flux of 51.7 kg/m2Â·h for a feed temperature of 70 Â°C. For each 1 kg of seawater fed to the system per hour, the total water recovery is 0.74 kg per hour. The heating duty could be covered by either solar panels of 13.8 m2 or the regasification of 3.10 kg LNG if the system is fully integrated. Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Wetland microtopography alters response of potential net CO2 and CH4 production to temperature and moisture: Evidence from a laboratory experiment
AB  - Coastal wetlands store significant amounts of carbon (C) belowground, which may be altered through effects of rising temperature and changing hydrology on CO2 and CH4 fluxes and related microbial activities. Wetland microtopography (hummock-hollow) also plays a critical role in mediating plant growth, microbial activity, and thus cycling of C and nutrients and may interact with rising seas to influence coastal wetland C dynamics. Recent evidence suggests that CH4 production in oxygenated surface soils of freshwater wetlands may contribute substantially to global CH4 production, but comprehensive studies linking potential CH4 production to environmental and microbial variables in temperate freshwater forested wetlands are lacking. This study investigated effects of temperature, moisture, and microtopography on potential net CO2 and CH4 production and extracellular enzyme activity (beta-glucosidase, xylosidase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase) in peat soils collected from a freshwater forested wetland in coastal North Carolina, USA. Soils were retrieved from three microsites (hummock, hollow, and subsurface peat soils (approximately 20-40 cm below surface)) and incubated at two temperatures (27 degrees C and 32 degrees C) and soil water contents (65\% and 100\% water holding capacity (WHC)). Hummocks had the highest cumulative potential net CO2 (13.7 +/- 0.90 mg CO2-C g soil(-1)) and CH4 (1.8 +/- 0.42 mg CH4-C g soil(-1)) production and enzyme activity, followed by hollows (8.7 +/- 0.91 mg CO2-C g soil(-1) and 0.5 +/- 0.12 mg CH4-C g soil(-1)) and then subsurface soils (5.7 +/- 0.70 mg CO2-C g soil(-1) and 0.04 +/- 0.019 mg CH4-C g soil(-1)). Fully saturated soils had lower potential net CO2 production (50-80\%) and substantially higher potential net CH4 production compared to non-saturated soils (those incubated at 65\% WHC). Soils incubated at 32 degrees C increased potential net CO2 (24-34\%) and CH4 (56-404\%) production under both soil moisture levels compared to those incubated at 27 degrees C. The Q(10) values for potential net CO2 and CH4 production ranged from 1.5 to 2.3 and 3.3-8.8, respectively, and did not differ between any microsites or soil water content. Enrichment of delta(CO2)-C-13-C was found in saturated soils from all microsites (-24.4 to - 29.7 parts per thousand) compared to non-saturated soils (-31.1 to - 32.4 parts per thousand), while delta(CH4)-C-13-C ranged from -62 to -55 parts per thousand in saturated soils. Together, the CO2 and CH4 delta C-13 data suggest that acetoclastic methanogenesis is an important pathway for CH4 production in these wetlands. A positive relationship (Adj. R-2 = 0.40) between peroxidase activity and CH(4 )production was also found, indicating that peroxidase activity may be important in providing fermented C substrates to acetoclastic methanogenic communities and contribute to anaerobic C mineralization. These results suggest that changes in temperature and hydrology could stimulate CO2 and CH4 emissions from surface hummock soils, and to a lesser extent from hollow soils, and provide preliminary evidence that hummocks may be a spatially important and unrecognized hotspot for CH4 production.

TI  - The effects of saltwater intrusion on germination success of standard and alternative crops
AB  - Saltwater intrusion (SWI) is the landward movement of seawater, which can salinize coastal farmlands and affect crop yields. Germination is an especially vulnerable life history stage for crops. Salt stress reduces a seed's ability to absorb water (osmotic stress) and causes an ion imbalance within the seed (ionic stress), ultimately inhibiting germination and preventing crop production. Therefore, growing standard crops in the face of SWI can risk crop failure. If alternative crops are more tolerant of osmotic and ionic stress, they may be more suited to withstand SWI. Our objectives were to (1) determine how salt stress (ionic and osmotic stress) and osmotic stress levels affect seed germination in standard and alternative crops in a controlled environment experiment and (2) compare germination rates in the controlled environment with field trials. In our study region of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, standard crop species include corn, soybean, and wheat; alternative species and varieties include sorghum, chloride-excluding soybean, barley, and quinoa. Seeds of these species were germinated under different levels of salt and osmotic stress ranging from 0 to -4 MPa (0-111.1 dS m(-1), respectively) by manipulating concentrations of NaCl to alter salt stress and concentrations of polyethylene glycol to alter osmotic stress. Crop species differed greatly in germination tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses, however, there was no significant difference in percent germination between standard and alternative crop species. Standard soybean, chloride-excluding soybean, and quinoa were the only species to germinate in salt stress; standard soybean and chloride-excluding soybean had an equal tolerance during germination at -1.8 MPa (50.0 dS m(-1)) and quinoa successfully germinated at -0.5 MPa (13.9 dS m(-1)). However, wheat (standard) and barley (alternative) were the most tolerant of osmotic stress, successfully germinating at -2 MPa (55.6 dS m(-1)). We also examined germination of sorghum and chloride-excluding soybeans in previously-established field trials for two years on two saltintruded farms on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. One of the farms showed greater germination success (measured as seedling emergence) in chloride-excluding soybean than sorghum despite a small difference in salt stress (Delta -0.05 MPa across the field). These results highlight the complexity of understanding how salt stress shapes germination processes in the real world and suggest temporal windows of low and high stress may have long-lasting consequences for crop performance.

TI  - Acute CO2 tolerance during the early developmental stages of four marine teleosts
AB  - Ocean sequestration of CO2 is proposed as a possible measure to mitigate climate changes caused by increasing atmospheric concentrations of the gas, but its impact on the marine ecosystem is unknown. We investigated the acute lethal effect of CO2 during the early developmental stages of four marine teleosts: red sea bream (Pagrus major), Japanese whiting (Sillago japonica), Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), and eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis). The percentages of larvae that hatched and survived were not affected by exposure to water with a PCO2 of 1.0 kPa (= 7.5 mmHg) within 24 h. Median lethal PCO2 values for a 360-min exposure were 1.4 kPa (cleavage), 5.1 kPa (embryo), 7.3 kPa (preflexion), 4.2 kPa (flexion), 4.6 kPa (postflexion), and 2.5 kPa (juvenile) for red sea bream; 2.4 kPa (cleavage), 4.9 kPa (embryo), 5.9 kPa (preflexion), 6.1 kPa (flexion), 4.1 kPa (postflexion), and 2.7 kPa (juvenile) for Japanese whiting; 2.8 kPa (cleavage) and &gt; 7.0 kPa (young) for Japanese flounder; and 11.8 kPa (cleavage) for eastern little tuna. Red sea bream and Japanese whiting of all ontogenetic stages had similar susceptibilities to CO2: the most susceptible stages were cleavage and juvenile, whereas the most tolerant stages were preflexion and flexion.

TI  - Production of biodiesel from coastal macroalgae (Chara vulgaris) and optimization of process parameters using Box-Behnken design
AB  - Renewable biodiesels are needed as an alternative to petroleum-derived transport fuels, which contribute to global warming and are of limited availability. Algae biomass, are a potential source of renewable energy, and they can be converted into energy such as biofuels. This study introduces an integrated method for the production of biodiesel from Chara vulgaris algae collected from the coastal region of Bangladesh. The Box-Behnken design based on response surface methods (RSM) used as the statistical tool to optimize three variables for predicting the best performing conditions (calorific value and yield) of algae biodiesel. The three parameters for production condition were chloroform (X-1), sodium chloride concentration (X-2) and temperature (X-3). Optimal conditions were estimated by the aid of statistical regression analysis and surface plot chart. The optimal condition of biodiesel production parameter for 12 g of dry algae biomass was observed to be 198 ml chloroform with 0.75 \% sodium chloride at 65 degrees C temperature, where the calorific value of biodiesel is 9255.106 kcal/kg and yield 3.6 ml.

TI  - Drivers need to slow down and think quicker
AB  - Lord Howie explains how motorists can think before they criticize and are stunned by the latest energy policies. Motorists are bemoaning their ot these days, though not for the first time. Motorists should be thankful for small mercies in the middle of a gigantic economic crisis. The relationship between road safety and speed has been hotly disputed for many years Budding Hamiltons and Buttons would like the speed limits to be disregarded when traffic was light, say in the middle of the night or on motorways. Brian Gregory, the chairman of the Association of British Drivers, feels that the best way to deal with accidents is to prevent them by getting drivers to pay more attention and to engineer roads to avoid them having false perceptions. As a resolute opponent to wind energy, whether offshore or on land, Lord has been perusing a recent book by James Lovelock entitled 'The vanishing face of Gaia' which he describes as 'a final warning.'.

TI  - Evaluation of power and freshwater production based on integrated gas turbine, S-CO2, and ORC cycles with RO desalination unit
AB  - In this paper, the simultaneous production of power and freshwater by the integration of a gas turbine (GT), a supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) cycle, an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and a reverse osmosis (RO) desalination unit is proposed. The S-CO2 and the ORC are bottoming cycles that recover the waste heat from the exhaust gases of the GT. A RO seawater desalination unit has been added to this power generation cycle to produce low-cost freshwater. The thermodynamic modelling and the simulation of the integrated cycle are performed. In addition, exergetic, exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental analyses have been carried out. Cyclopentane has been chosen as working fluid of the ORC. The results show that the total energy generated by the cycles is about 75.1 MW; the compressors and pumps consume 44\% and the rest is sent to the electricity grid. The integration of the S-CO2 cycle with the gas turbine increases the total efficiency by 10.9\%. Also, the addition of the ORC to this integration, improves the efficiency by about 2\%. The cost of power generation in the gas turbine is about 0.604 \$/s, in the turbine of the S-CO2 cycle about 0.182 \$/s and in the turbine of ORC cycle about 0.036 \$/s. The cost of freshwater production in the RO unit with 5 MW of power consumption is 0.88 \$/m(3). The results show that the proposed combined GT/S-CO2/ORC/RO regenerative system is promising in terms of waste heat recovery from gas turbines. As advantages, deep waste heat recovery, high exergetic efficiency, and low power and freshwater costs have been achieved.

TI  - Consequences of a simulated rapid ocean acidification event for benthic ecosystem processes and functions
AB  - Whilst the biological consequences of long-term, gradual changes in acidity associated with the oceanic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) are increasingly studied, the potential effects of rapid acidification associated with a failure of sub-seabed carbon storage infrastructure have received less attention. This study investigates the effects of severe short-term (8days) exposure to acidified seawater on infaunal mediation of ecosystem processes (bioirrigation and sediment particle redistribution) and functioning (nutrient concentrations). Following acidification, individuals of Amphiura filiformis exhibited emergent behaviour typical of a stress response, which resulted in altered bioturbation, but limited changes in nutrient cycling. Under acidified conditions, A. filiformis moved to shallower depths within the sediment and the variability in occupancy depth reduced considerably. This study indicated that rapid acidification events may not be lethal to benthic invertebrates, but may result in behavioural changes that could have longer-term implications for species survival, ecosystem structure and functioning.

TI  - A compact closed cycle gas turbine for marine propulsion
AB  - A compact closed cycle gas turbine is described. The design was developed during the course of research conducted for the Office of Naval Research on the feasibility of lightweight, compact closed Brayton cycle systems (Contract N00014-C-0706). Emphasis was placed on applying the closed Brayton cycle to Navy high-speed ships currently under development and planned. These applications pose demanding requirements for compactness and light weight necessitating careful attention to the design of turbomachinery and heat exchanger components and their integration into the powerplant. The use of helium, with its propensity to leak at ducting joints, requires that containment integrity be provided without precluding access to plant components for maintenance. The design described meets these requirements by arranging the powerplant components in a closely integrated assembly within a completely enveloping pressure vessel. The research accomplished to date is discussed and the predicted power conversion system performance and characteristics are summarized. Â© Copyright 1979 by ASME.

TI  - A Contact-Mode Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Energy Harvesting from Marine Pipe Vibrations
AB  - Structural health monitoring is of great significance to ensure the safety of marine pipes, while powering the required monitoring sensors remains a problem because the ocean environment is not amenable to the traditional ways of providing an external power supply. However, mechanical energy due to the vortex-induced vibration of pipelines may be harvested to power those sensors, which is a convenient, economic and environmentally friendly way. We here exploit a contact-separation mode triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) to create an efficient energy harvester to transform the mechanical energy of vibrating pipes into electrical energy. The TENG device is composed of a tribo-pair of dielectric material films that is connected to a mass-spring base to guarantee the contact-separation motions of the tribo-pair. Experimental tests are conducted to demonstrate the output performance and long-term durability of the TENG device by attaching it to a sample pipe. A theoretical model for the energy harvesting system is developed for predicting the electrical output performance of the device. It is established that the normalized output power depends only on two compound variables with all typical factors taken into consideration simultaneously. The simple scale law is useful to reveal the underlying mechanism of the device and can guideline the optimization of the device based on multi-parameters analyses. The results here may provide references for designing contact-mode TENG energy harvesting devices based on the vibration of marine pipes and similar structures.

TI  - Energy management strategy for a short-route hybrid cruise ship: an IGDT-based approach
AB  - The increments of the emission tiers and global warming, as well as the reduction of fossil fuels, have led to a change in the power system of vehicles. Even in maritime transportation, there are more restrictions due to environmental regulations of some ports. In this study, the energy management problem of a marine power system is investigated, such a system includes a diesel generator, solar system, energy storage system (ESS), electrical boiler system, and electrical heat pump. The proposed risk-based strategy for scheduling multiple energy systems of a hybrid cruise ship (HCS) is able to provide the electrical and thermal demands related to the cruise services in a reliable and optimal way. The examined HCS travels daily in the Baltic Sea between Stockholm in Swedish mainland and Mariehamn on the angstrom land islands and carries hundreds of passengers in various tour programmes, representing an uncertain shipboard loading profile. Therefore, an information gap decision theory-based (IGDT-based) methodology is applied to model the uncertain HCS load. Furthermore, the proposed multiple energy system can adopt various strategies namely risk-averse and risk-seeker to face different consumption patterns. Finally, the numerical results obtained from actual test case validate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach.

TI  - SUSTAINABLE PORT INFRASTRUCTURE, PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GREEN PORT CONCEPT
AB  - The overall idea and research interest related with the development of sustainable port infrastructure evolved around the core requirements of continuous reduction of negative environmental impacts without jeopardising economic growth. The growth of trade activities and need for competitiveness on the global market are forcing ports around the world to systematically and continuously evaluate all possibilities for the optimisation and related costs reduction. On the implementation level, the greatest challenge is how to empower workers, who operate machines and work on the shop floor, to achieve enduring performance improvements. Presented research work provides a methodological approach for finding realistic solutions to the problem of the future development challenges of seaports. The case study shown in this research represents a practical application of the green port concept with the emphasis on the overall energy efficiency improvement based on testing, deployment and demonstration of energy efficient solutions. Additional emphasis was placed on the state-of-the-art technologies and developing pilot initiatives based on modern energy solutions designed to improve efficiency in fuel consumption and emissions reduction in rubber tired gantry cranes.

TI  - Integrity Assessment of Mooring Systems Using Position Measurements
AB  - Floating Production Systems (FPS) remain on station many years without dry docking. The mooring lines,which ensure station keeping, are designed to last the entire service life of the FPS. However, many mooringline failures or premature replacements have occurred in the past [1]. Most existing mooring line failurealarm systems utilize subsea load cells or inclinometers, which are expensive to maintain or replace andare not sufficiently reliable [2]. Hence, this paper presents a new methodology to assess the mooringintegrity by means of position measurements only, which is less expensive and potentially more reliable.This methodology for mooring line integrity assessment was developed as part of the LifeLine Joint IndustryProject and focuses on application for a variety of FPSOs with different characteristics. The methodologycontains two different approaches for the position data processing. One approach is an event-based method.It attempts to identify failure events by the semi-instantaneous shift in the mean static offset of the floater.The second approach is a status-based method. It assesses the integrity of the mooring lines by keepingtrack of the unit position in a longer time frame. In this paper the methodology will be described in general and the validation results will be presented.Validation is done by using simulated blind tests as well as in-service measurements of several FPSOs. Thevalidation results of blind tests and in-service measurements are presented for 3 floaters. It was concludedthat all mooring line failures were identified by the LifeLine methodology within the target time of two totwelve days, and in all cases the correct bundle with the broken mooring line was identified. This researchis a big first step towards realizing a more reliable, more sustainable and less expensive mooring line failurewarning system than the existing state-of-the-art systems. Further validation efforts will be continued in theLifeLine JIP, and a first prototype of the LifeLine system will soon be implemented on an FPSO in the field.

TI  - Techno-Economic Assessment of Demand-Driven Small-Scale Green Hydrogen Production for Low Carbon Agriculture in Sweden
AB  - Wind power coupled to hydrogen (H2) production is an interesting strategy to reduce power curtailment and to provide clean fuel for decarbonizing agricultural activities. However, such implementation is challenging for several reasons, including uncertainties in wind power availability, seasonalities in agricultural fuel demand, capital-intensive gas storage systems, and high specific investment costs of small-scale electrolysers. To investigate whether on-site H2 production could be a feasible alternative to conventional diesel farming, a model was built for dynamic simulations of H2 production from wind power driven by the fuel demand of a cereal farm located on the island of Gotland, Sweden. Different cases and technological scenarios were considered to assess the effects of future developments, H2 end-use, as well as production scale on the levelised- and farmersâ€™ equivalent annual costs. In a single-farm application, H2 production costs varied between 21.20â€“14.82Â â‚¬/kg. By sharing a power-to-H2 facility among four different farms of 300-ha each, the specific investment costs could be significantly decreased, resulting in 28% lower H2 production costs than when facilities are not shared. By including delivery vans as additional H2 consumers in each farm, costs of H2 production decreased by 35% due to the higher production scale and more distributed demand. However, in all cases and technological scenarios assessed, projected diesel price in retailers was cheaper than H2. Nevertheless, revenues from leasing the land to wind power developers could make H2 a more attractive option even in single-farm applications as early as 2020. Without such revenues, H2 is more competitive than diesel where power-to-H2 plants are shared by at least two farms, if technological developments predicted for 2030 come true. Also, out of 20 different cases assessed, nine of them showed a carbon abatement cost lower than the current carbon tax in Sweden of 110 â‚¬/tCO2, which demonstrate the potential of power-to-H2 as an effective strategy to decarbonize agricultural systems.

TI  - Influence of sea level rise on multiobjective management of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers
AB  - This study demonstrates the influence of climate change-induced sea level rise on multiobjective saltwater intrusion management strategies in coastal aquifers. Three metamodels were developed from the solutions of a numerical simulation model of the coupled flow and salt transport processes in a coastal aquifer system. Results revealed that the proposed metamodels are capable of predicting density-dependent coupled flow and salt transport patterns quite accurately. Based on a comparison of the three methods, the best metamodel was selected as a computationally inexpensive substitute for the simulation model in the coupled simulation-optimization-based saltwater intrusion management model. To achieve computational efficiency, the optimization routine of the proposed management model was performed on a parallel computing platform. The performance of the proposed methodology was evaluated for an illustrative multilayered coastal aquifer system in which the effect of climate change-induced sea level rise was incorporated for the specified management period. Results show that the proposed saltwater intrusion management model provides acceptable, accurate, and reliable solutions while significantly improving computational efficiency in a coupled simulation-optimization methodology.

TI  - Development of an off-grid solar energy powered reverse osmosis desalination system for continuous production of freshwater with integrated photovoltaic thermal (PVT) cooling
AB  - Increasing urbanisation and population growth have caused depletion of freshwater resources leading to exacerbation of water scarcity in remote communities. Whilst much attention has been paid to improving industrial-scale desalination plants over the past decade, the development of small-scale off-grid desalination units to facilitate freshwater supply for remote communities has been overlooked. This study presents a novel method for coupling solar photovoltaic thermal (PVT) cells to reverse osmosis (RO) desalination introducing seawater as the cooling medium to increase the thermal efficiency of solar energy generation and subsequently maximising the rate of freshwater production. The inclusion of a battery unit will enable a constant rate of freshwater supply leading to minimisation of membrane fouling which often occurs in renewable energy powered membrane desalination units. The integrative system has been simulated for the seawater properties and climatic conditions in Alexandria, Egypt. Furthermore, the modelling results indicate that using the proposed method will lead to a reduction of 0.12 kWh/m3 in the specific electricity consumption rate of RO desalination, as well as increasing the electricity generation capacity of the PVT cells leading to a 6% reduction in the required solar panel surface area.

TI  - Combustion of seaweed â€” A fuel design strategy
AB  - The high ash content and varying ash composition in algal biomass is often mentioned as problematic if to be used for thermal energy conversion. This paper suggests an approach where detailed information on ash composition and predicted ash formation reactions are basis for successful remedies enabling the use of fuels considered to be difficult. The procedure is demonstrated on seaweed (Saccharina latissima) cultivated for biorefinery purposes. The ash composition of the seaweed was found suitable for co-combustion with Miscanthus x giganteus, an energy crop high in alkali and silicon. Fuel mixtures were combusted in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor and ash samples were analyzed by SEM-EDS and XRD. The results showed that Ca from the seaweed was very reactive and thus efficient in solving the silicate melting problems. The fuel design approach was proven successful and the potential for using otherwise difficult seaweed fuels in synergetic co-combustion was demonstrated. Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Incorporating conceptual site models into national-scale environmental risk assessments for legacy waste in the coastal zone
AB  - Solid wastes deposited in the coastal zone that date from an era of lax environmental regulations continue to pose significant challenges for regulators and coastal managers worldwide. The increasing risk of contaminant release from these legacy disposal sites, due to a range of factors including rising sea levels, associated saline intrusion, and greater hydrological extremes, have been highlighted by many researchers. Given this widespread challenge, and the often-limited remedial funds available, there is a pressing need for the development of new advanced site prioritization protocols to limit potential pollution risks to sensitive ecological or human receptors. This paper presents a multi-criteria decision analysis that integrates the principles of Conceptual Site Models (Source-Pathway-Receptor) at a national scale in England and Wales to identify legacy waste sites where occurrence of pollutant linkages are most likely. A suite of spatial data has been integrated in order to score potential risks associated with waste type (Source), likelihood of pollutant release relating to current and future flood and erosion climate projections, alongside current management infrastructure (Pathway), and proximity to sensitive ecological features or proxies of human use in coastal areas (Receptors). Of the 30,281 legacy waste deposits identified in England and Wales, 3,219 were located within the coastal zone, with coastal areas containing a density of legacy wastes (by area) 10.5 times higher than inland areas. Of these, 669 were identified as priority sites in locations without existing coastal defences or flood management infrastructure, with 2550 sites identified in protected areas where contaminant transfer risks could still be apparent. The majority (63\%) of the priority sites have either undefined source terms, or are classified as mixed wastes. Mining and industrial wastes were also notable waste categories, and displayed strong regional distributions in the former mining areas of north-east and south-west of England, south Wales, and post-industrial estuaries. The large-scale screening process presented here could be used by environmental managers as a foundation to direct more high-resolution site assessment and remedial work at priority sites, and can be used as a tool by governments for directing funding to problematic sites.

TI  - Biomass generation and biodiesel production from macroalgae grown in the irrigation canal wastewater
AB  - The wastewater concentration is commonly acceptable for macroalgae growth as this process consumes water and is applicable for bioremediation. Biodieselâ€™s potential production from freshwater macroalga, Nitella sp., was investigated using batch experiment. Algae were collected from wastewater saturated from irrigation canals. Water quality and algae growth environment characteristics were monitored and evaluated. COD and BOD values were 18.67Â±4.62 mg/L and 5.40 Â± 0.30 mg/L, respectively. The chemical composition contents were high, indicating that water quality and sufficient nutrients could support algae growth. Oil extraction was estimated by the room temperature and heat extraction methods. The biodiesel in room temperature treatment was 0.0383% Â± 0.014%, and in heat, extraction treatment was 0.0723% Â± 0.029%. The heat extraction treatment yielded a high amount of oil and biodiesel yield. GC/MS, applied to analyze fatty acid methyl esters, revealed that 9-octadecane was a major portion of the substance. The obtained results confirmed that the wastewater contains many elements that can be utilized for dual-mode, i.e., bioremediation and enhanced macroalgae growth for biodiesel production. Thus, macroalgae grown in canal wastewater were highly feasible for use in sustainable biodiesel production.

TI  - Rolls-Royce contemplates the winds of change
AB  - Only a few months have passed since the agreement at IMOâ€™s MEPC 73 that shipping should target an overall 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050, but for most within maritime, industry innovators are getting together plans on how these requirements might be achieved. In response to this issue, Rolls-Royce Marine outlined a possible solution, synergizing the divisionâ€™s much-publicized work in the development of remote and autonomous vessels with analysis of current source of waste in the transportation and logistics process. With this goal, Rolls-Royce has been developing the â€œPoint-to-Pointâ€, a 4000 TEU LNG-powered container ship concept which incorporates several distinctive features. Furthermore, the company is considering towards the potential of wind power which, combined with autonomous shipping, could be the key to achieving future carbon targets. The concept, called Blue Breeze takes a standard 40,000 dwt handy-size bulker, removes the deckhouse, and integrates four 30 m Flettner rotors, which offer 10 times more lift than a soft sail would for the same area.

TI  - A Case Study on Miscible and Immiscible Gas-Injection Pilots in a Middle East Carbonate Reservoir in an Offshore Environment
AB  - Hydrocarbon-gas injection is one of the most widely applied processes in the oil industry and is a promising enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) method for use in Middle East carbonate oil fields. Gas injection improves the microscopic-displacement efficiency and generally acts as pressure maintenance; however, unfavorable mobility ratio can negatively affect the ultimate recovery because of viscous fingering and gravity override. This paper describes two gas-injection pilots that have been implemented in offshore Middle East carbonate reservoirs: a secondary and a tertiary gas injection through line drive to assess injectivity, productivity, macroscopic-sweep efficiency, flow assurance, and operational efficiency in a field that has a long water-injection history. A strong monitoring plan, including an observer well, was applied through time-lapse saturation logging, pressure measurements, production testing, and a tracer campaign to evaluate the pilot efficiency and address key uncertainties upfront before full-field application. This paper describes the pilot performance in the context of full-field-development, local- and macroscopic-displacement efficiency, flow-assurance issues, and operational learnings. The gas injection performance is strongly affected by reservoir heterogeneity, gravity segregation, and the existing pressure gradient, and the history match performed indicates near-miscible or miscible behavior depending upon local pressure regimes, which thus govern the ultimate recovery. The history match also shows that for the same pilot, performance can be further improved through water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection, resulting in a viable development scheme for full-field implementation.

TI  - Circulation induced by coastal diffuser discharge
AB  - Submerged multiport diffusers are often used to discharge waste heat resulting from once-through cooling at coastal power plants. A particularly effective design, known as a staged diffuser, involves nozzles oriented offshore, parallel with the diffuser pipe. Potential flow analyses are used to describe the far field entrainment region for a staged diffuser discharging to quiescent receiving water of either constant depth or linear sloping bottom. Boundary conditions, in the form of a distributed sink, are supplied by a simplified near field model. Whereas near field theory shows that dilution can be increased by increasing discharge velocity, extending diffuser length or siting in deeper water, the latter options are shown to be preferable from the standpoint of minimizing induced velocities and the magnitude of nearshore entrainment.

Another proposal is an offshore wind project to be located 30 mi from the tip of Long Island. According to a report by Bloomberg New Energy solar power is becoming the cheapest form of new electricity. Solar prices are competing with those of coal and natural gas and that solar prices are even falling below those for wind power in some countries.

TI  - Modelling of biological impact in direct injection of carbon dioxide in the ocean
AB  - It is important to predict biological impacts caused by the ocean sequestration Of CO2. For this purpose, a mortality model was developed to predict the acute lethal damage of DCO2 to marine organisms. The model was installed in the two-phase CFD method with mass transfer, which had been developed in order to predict droplet plume flow, the dissolution Of CO2 from droplets into seawater, and the advection-diffusion of dissolved CO2. The simulation results suggest that the biological impacts of the CO2 sequestration can be insignificant in terms of mortality in the cases we proposed.

TI  - Citronelle Dome: A giant opportunity for multizone carbon storage and enhanced oil recovery in the Mississippi Interior Salt Basin of Alabama
AB  - The Citronelle Dome is a giant, salt-cored anticline in the eastern Mississippi Interior Salt Basin of southern Alabama that is located near several large-scale, stationary, carbon-emitting sources in the greater Mobile area. The dome forms an elliptical, four-way structural closure containing opportunities for CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) and large-capacity saline reservoir CO2 sequestration. The Citronelle oil field, located on the crest of the dome, has produced more than 169 million bbl of 42-46Â° API gravity oil from sandstone bodies in the Lower Cretaceous Rodessa Formation. The top seal for the oil accumulation is a thick succession of shale and anhydrite, and the reservoir is underfilled such that oil-water contacts are typically elevated 30-60 m (100-200 ft) above the structural spill point. Approximately 31-34% of the original oil in place has been recovered by primary and secondary methods, and CO2-EOR has the potential to increase reserves by up to 20%. Structural contour maps of the dome demonstrate that the area of structural closure increases upward in section. Sandstone units providing prospective carbon sinks include the Massive and Pilot sands of the lower Tuscaloosa Group, as well as several sandstone units in the upper Tuscaloosa Group and the Eutaw Formation. Many of these sandstone units are characterized by high porosity and permeability with low heterogeneity. The Tuscaloosa-Eutaw interval is capped by up to 610 m (2000 ft) of chalk and marine shale that are proven reservoir seals in nearby oil fields. Therefore, the Citronelle Dome can be considered a major geologic sink where CO2 can be safely stored while realizing the economic benefits associated with CO2-EOR. Copyright Â© 2008.

TI  - Downtime analysis of FPSO
AB  - Hydrocarbons remain the most important fuel in todayâ€™s world despite recent depreciaÂ­tion in their economic value and continuous developments in the use of alternative sources of energy such as solar power. The Organization for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD) predicts a bounce back in the value of hydrocarbons in coming years which implies that there will be more exploration, offshore drilling and production of hydrocarbons worldwide. Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessels have been widely used for these operations due to their cost effectiveness especially in remote areas. The oil produced from an FPSO can be transported to the mainland by the use of tankers and the offloading process from FPSO to tanker can be affected by weather conditions. Hence, a rigorous downtime analysis for the offloading operation has to be conducted to ensure crew safety and to maximize production. A simplified method for analysing the weather downtime on a turret moored FPSO and the tandem offloading process is presented in this paper and the workability for both vessels is presented.

TI  - Impact of Nitrogen Oxides Emission Reduction Methods on Specific Fuel Consumption of Marine Diesel Engines
AB  - The paper has been presented the methods of nitrogen oxides emission reduction to fulfill the Tier 2 and Tier 3 requirements of the Annex VI of MARPOL Convention. It has been shown the development of marine two-stroke diesel engines and the change of nitrogen oxides emission from 1960 to 2000 and later up to 2020 after the implementation of NOx emission reduction methods. Specific fuel consumption before 2000, and as a prediction and given data in the manufacturers manuals for Tier 3 engines up to 2020, and as only a prediction up to 2030 has been analyzed and elaborated. Impact of nitrogen oxides reduction methods on the specific fuel consumption of the marine diesel engine has been evaluated. Additional emission of some gases to the atmosphere due to the implementation of reduction methods has been determined. EGR and SCR systems have got a lot of imperfections: required to install additional reduction systems (investment cost, required volume in the engine room), need maintenance and operation costs, produced wastes during treatment process. The estimated additional cost is about 0.8 USD/MWh of produced energy, taking into account only the cost of excessive used fuel. The whole increased cost may reach the level two-three times more due to cleaning systems investment costs, their operational cost and waste disposal. It has been the one of the reasons of worsening the transport effectiveness and competitiveness.

TI  - Movable chain jacks and winches, case study of Petrobras' P58/P62 and Eni's Goliat FPSOs
AB  - Recently, Aker Solutions delivered a movable chain jack system to Petrobras's P58/P62 FPSOs and a movable windlass system to ENI's Goliat FPSO. This paper highlights the main differences between the two systems and when it is beneficial to employ movable systems. There are many parameters to consider in determining which system to use - also a traditional system involving a single winch or chain jack per mooring line may in many cases be preferred. The movable chain jack concept is designed to operate multiple mooring lines within the same cluster. A single chain jack is lifted by a skidding gantry and moved to the next mooring line and so forth. Installation and messenger chains are moved using a large sliding chain locker allowing for later offloading of the surplus chain. The movable windlass system is also designed to operate multiple mooring lines within the same cluster. However, in this case the winch is rotary and can operate via electric or hydraulic power. One of the main considerations is to move the windlass and keep the mooring lines intact without cutting them. Copyright 2013, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - The superpile system: A feasible alternate foundation for TLP in deep water
AB  - This paper discusses a possible alternate Foundation system for TLP platforms in deep water. It was developed through Tecnomare for Agip during a feasibility study related to a site located in the Southern Adriatic Sea having a water depth of 827 m. The system is a combination of a pile-gravity foundation, consisting of relatively short (â‰…20 m) steel piles of very large diameter (6 to 12 m) called "superpiles", closed at the top and open at the bottom and installed in soft soil under the effect of self-weight and "active" suction, The permanent tension of the tendons is equilibrated by self-weight only; tension due to wave action is equilibrated by the weight of the soil inside the superpiles. In fact a pulsating tension applied to the superpiles generates a suction keeping the soil plug inside the cylinder and preventing the cylinder from being extracted from the (impervious) foundation soil. The paper describes the results of analyses of the installation and in service behaviour of superpiles, based on conventional principles of soil mechanics and related to a typical profile of clays at the site. Installation problems are briefly discussed; tnen the stability in service is examined, and the capacity of superpiles in compression and in tension and the associated factors of safety are evaluated. Finally, considering the pore pressure gradient generated by the applied tension inside the soil plug, the flow rate and related deformations during storms and the expected diesign life of the TLP are evaluated. In conclusion, the proposed system appears to be feasible, easy to install, and economical. Further study and experimental research is needed to optimize its full potentiality.

TI  - An experimental study of CO2 hydrate-based seawater desalination with the R141b as an accelerant
AB  - In the previous development of those continental and offshore sour gas fields in China, CO2 removed from the produced natural gas contributed a lot to carbon emission, which not only led to global warming but brought about a great loss. However, the recycling of CO2 produced along with natural gas has aroused research interest in present China. CO2 hydrate-based desalination is a new seawater desalination technique that is still in laboratory research in China. This technique uses small-molecule materials, which easily form hydrate, and seawater to form solid hydrate and after the solid-liquid separation, fresh water can be obtained from the solid hydrate dissociation. In order to improve the efficiency of CO2 hydrate-based desalination, in this experimental study, R141b was used as an accelerant to accelerate the forming speed of CO2 hydrate in seawater. Based on our experimental device with two reactors developed for hydrate seawater desalination, the R141b proportion and its effects on the efficiency of CO2 hydrate-based desalination were discussed, and the technical parameters of this method were also suggested. The degree of seawater desalination was discussed through measuring the variation of the salinities and ionic concentrations in the solution before and after the hydrate was formed. The following findings were achieved. a. The optimal v/v ratio of R141b to seawater was 1:70. The efficiency of CO2 hydrate-based desalination with R141b was 3 times higher than that without R141b. b. The removing rates of ions in the first and second grade desalination water were 58.7% and 81.0%, respectively, and reached up to 94.8% and 98.4% in the third and fourth grade desalination water, respectively. c. The ionic concentrations in the fourth grade desalination water were even better than those in the national standard drinking water.

TI  - Ecolabels can improve public perception and farm profits for shellfish aquaculture
AB  - Ecolabels are increasingly being used to notify consumers that the labeled product imposes minimal harm to the environment or other natural resources. A growing number of studies have signaled that consumers respond to these labels, which can promote environmentally friendly production of consumable goods and incentivize growers to produce sustainably sourced goods. Shellfish are noticeably absent among these labeled products, but they are arguably the most sustainable source of animal protein. Additionally, while in the water, oysters and other shellfish provide numerous ecosystem services that improve environmental quality. We argue that shellfish aquaculture is uniquely positioned to take advantage of ecolabeling to improve public perception and steer consumers towards a highly sustainable source of animal protein. However, we also argue more research is needed to better understand how ecosystem services vary among different production modes of oyster aquaculture to ensure products are correctly labeled and inspire consumer confidence.

TI  - Phytoplankton strengthen CO2 uptake in the South Atlantic Ocean
AB  - The influence of phytoplankton groups on carbon dynamics was investigated during six oceanographic spring cruises (three cruises were carried out in 2009, and another three were conducted in 2011) between the western (Brazil) and eastern (Africa) South Atlantic margins. A seventh cruise crossed the South Atlantic during the early winter of 2015. Sea surface temperature and salinity, oceanic and atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), chlorophyll a and other phytoplankton pigment data were gathered. Net CO2 fluxes were calculated for each cruise, characterizing the ability of each region to take up atmospheric CO2. We quantified phytoplankton chemotaxonomic groups using the HPLC/CHEMTAX approach. Thus, this study aimed to improve our understanding of the distribution of phytoplankton groups and their connection with the carbon biogeochemical cycle in the South Atlantic Ocean. Our results showed significant variations in both the zonal and meridional patterns of phytoplankton groups and the associated CO2 uptake magnitudes. Diatoms and haptophytes dominated the coastal regions of Brazil and Africa, respectively, whereas the open ocean was dominated by haptophytes and the picoplanktonic cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. The CO2 uptake capacity increased eastward from -7.1 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) on the Brazilian coast to 27.6 mmol CO2 m(-2) d(-1) on the African coast. There was a significant negative relationship (p < 0.05) between the phytoplankton biomass and the difference in sea-air pCO(2) (Delta pCO(2)), with increasing CO2 uptake corresponding to increases in the biomasses of diatoms and haptophytes. Therefore, according to our analysis, haptophytes and diatoms were the main phytoplankton groups related to a high uptake of CO2 along the South Atlantic Ocean regions covered in this study. Thus, we encourage further investigations on their traits and vulnerabilities to future environmental change scenarios.

TI  - Carbonation of mafic-ultramafic rocks: A new approach to carbon dioxide geological sequestration
AB  - Geological sequestration is an effective way to enhance the net reduction of global CO 2 emission. In nature, there is vast amount of carbonation of mafic-ultramafic rocks, reacting with CO 2 to produce stable carbonate minerals. Factors that affect carbonation reaction rates of mafic-ultramafic rocks with CO 2 include temperature, pressure, pH values, fluid flow rate, and contact surface area, etc. . Exothermic mineral reactions can drive the carbonation system into a self-heating regime. Meanwhile, controlling fluid flow rates can maintain the optimal temperature for reaction rate. Peridotites in ophiolite, continental flood basalt and deep-sea basalt are widespread on the shallow surface of the earth, providing an alternative for CO 2 storage. Current research demonstrates that both technology and economic cost are available. Therefore, mafic-ultramafic rocks have huge potential for CO 2 sequestration and it is a new approach to CO 2 geological sequestration.

TI  - Flow assurance issues related to flexible riser and pipeline system configuration
AB  - Flexible riser and pipeline systems have been proposed as a promising solution for offshore oil and gas production systems in various harsh and challenging marine environments. They have many advantages compared with traditional rigid riser and pipeline systems, including: relatively low axial bending stiffness; ability to spool on a reel for easy transport and faster installation; and suitability for various floating systems. Flexible riser and pipeline systems typically have buoyancy modules to produce a lazy wave or similar configuration in the riser to decouple the floating vessel motions from the touchdown point. However, the buoyancy modules may move or even drag the riser in the horizontal direction, which may cause the riser shape to change or the riser bottom to move on the seabed. The riser shape/configuration may change, even slightly, with the movement of buoyancy modules or flexible riser, resulting in potentially significant changes in flow assurance design issues related to slugging and system blowdown. Case studies were carried out using transient multiphase simulation software, as reported in this paper, to investigate the slugging issues impacted by slight variations in the riser configuration in flexible pipeline/riser systems, including slight uphill and downhill riser base configurations. These small changes in the riser shape/configuration can also cause significant differences in the resulting residual pressures in the subsea pipeline and riser after blowing down the system. The results from this paper suggest that the riser shape/configuration in flexible pipe systems has a significant impact on flow assurance concerns, especially the impact of slugging and blowdown residual pressures related to hydrate prevention and mitigation. Consequently, the sensitivity of riser shape/configuration in flexible riser and pipeline systems should be considered in early design phases to understand the impact on key flow assurance strategies.

TI  - Metabolic Regulation and Metabolic Engineering for Biofuel and Biochemical Production
AB  - The global warming problem is becoming critical year by year, causing climate disaster all over the world, where it has been believed that the CO2 gas emitted from the factories and the burning of fossil fuels may be one of the reasons of global warming. Moreover, the global stock of fossil fuels is limited, and may run out soon within several tens of years. Although wind, geo-thermal, and tide energies have been considered as clean energy sources, those depend on the land or sea locations and subject to the climate change. Biofuel and biochemical production from renewable bio-resources has thus been paid recent attention from environmental protection and energy production points of view, where the current chemical and energy producing plants can be also utilized with slight modification. The so-called 1st generation biofuels have been produced from corn starch and sugarcane in particular in USA and Brazil. However, this causes the problem of the so-called â€œfood and energy issuesâ€ as the production scale increases. The 2nd generation biofuel production from lingo-cellulosic biomass or wastes has thus been paid recent attention. However, it requires energy intensive pretreatment for the degradation of lingo-cellulosic biomass, and the fermentation is slow due to low growth rate, and thus the productivity of biofuels and bio-chemicals is low. The 3rd generation biofuel production from photosynthetic organisms such as cyanobacteria and algae has been also paid attention, because such organisms can grow with only sun light and CO2 in the air, but the cell growth rate and thus the productivity of the fuels is significantly low. The main part or core of such production processes is the fermentation by micro-organisms. In particular, it is critical to properly understand the cell metabolism followed by the efficient metabolic engineering. The book gives comprehensive explanation of the cell metabolism and the metabolic regulation mechanisms of a variety of micro-organisms. Then the efficient metabolic engineering approaches are explained to properly design the microbial cell factories for the efficient cell growth and biofuel and biochemical production.

TI  - Opportunity and challenge of seaweed bioethanol based on life cycle CO2 assessment
AB  - Seaweed bioethanol technology is being developed to mitigate climate change and to overcome economic and environmental drawbacks that terrestrial bioethanol has: biomass demand competition for food and energy, and land-use change impacts. To investigate whether seaweed bioethanol is better than terrestrial bioethanol, we compare the global warming potentials (GWPs) of seaweed and terrestrial bioethanols from a life cycle perspective including land-related GWP effects from carbon debt, soil carbon sequestration, and N2O emission. Our results demonstrated that seaweed bioethanol has lower GWP in the long term than terrestrial bioethanols from corn grain, corn stover, and switchgrass, primarily because seaweed cultivation does not consume fertilizers and incur carbon debt and N2O emission. It was noted that future R\&D strategy for low-carbon seaweed bioethanol needs to be directed to developing biomaterial-based cultivation equipment and reusing existing equipment, as well as enhancing bioethanol conversion yield and biomass productivity. Due to the vast sea available for seaweed cultivation, seaweed bioethanol could significantly contribute to mitigating climate change.

TI  - Atmospheric carbon removal capacity of a mangrove ecosystem in a micro-tidal basin estuary in Sri Lanka
AB  - Characterization of the micro-tidal mangrove forests in Negombo estuary, located on the west coast of Sri Lanka, with respect to its capacity to remove atmospheric carbon and sequestration in above and below ground plant components is the objective of this study. These mangroves constitute both natural stands (e.g. Kadolkele) and woodlots planted, protected and managed by fishermen (e.g. Wedikanda) to extract twigs and branches to construct "brush parks", a traditional method of fishing in this estuary. Both types of mangrove stands support high species richness and structural diversity, indicating planted mangrove areas have reached a semi-natural state. Allometric relationships were used to calculate biomass increment. Differences in litterfall, above and below ground biomass increment and net primary productivity (NPP) of the two types of mangrove areas were statistically insignificant, thus indicating that they are structurally and functionally comparable. Average rate of mangrove litterfall in Negombo estuary was 802 Â± 25 g m-2y-1. The average above ground biomass increment was 1213 Â± 95 gm-2y-1 and below ground increment was 267 Â± 18 gm-2y-1, thus the average NPP of these mangroves was 2282 Â± 125 g m-2y-1. NPP showed a decreasing trend from water towards land, in line with plant density and leaf area index. A statistically significant relationship was found between vegetation structure (represented by complexity index), NPP and rate of organic carbon accumulation in mangroves. Potential carbon accumulation capacity of mangroves of Negombo estuary was estimated to be approximately 12 t ha-1y-1, which is equivalent to the amount of carbon emitted as CO2 through combustion of 19,357 L of diesel or 22,212 L of gasoline in motor vehicles. Potential atmospheric carbon removal capacity of Negombo estuarine mangroves (350 ha in extent) therefore was estimated to be 4143 t y-1, which is equivalent to removal of CO2 emitted through combustion of 6,779,000 L of diesel or 7,779,000 L of gasoline within a year.

TI  - JEM spotlight: Nuclear desalination - Environmental impacts and implications for planning and monitoring activities
AB  - Nuclear desalination has been identified as an option since the 1960s, but only recently, as climate change intensifies, has it gained interest again. Although environmental impacts of nuclear desalination have not been paid a lot of attention in the few implemented projects, now more than ever, it is essential to provide an overview of their nature and magnitude. The gathered information and basic analysis allow for a general comparison of a 200,000 m3/d nuclear desalination facility using a once-through cooling system as a reference case, with alternative co-location options. Results of the review indicate that the potential for marine impacts requires careful planning and monitoring. They also reveal that adverse coastal, atmospheric and socio-economic impacts are minor in comparison with other co-location alternatives. The issues regarding public health are discussed and experiences presented. Nuclear desalination facilities are expected to show a better environmental performance than other co-located power/desalination options. Environmental planning and monitoring activities are thus much simpler and their scope smaller, with the most important monitoring parameters listed. In conclusion, the application of nuclear desalination is recommended as a less environmentally harmful option. Â© 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Nuclear fuel reprocessing and related discharges
AB  - This article summarizes the history of marine applications of radionuclides discharged from nuclear fuel reprocessing plants and their utility as tracers of water circulation in the global ocean. The most important reprocessing plants from an oceanographic perspective are those located at Sellafield (UK) and La Hague (France) which discharge into the Irish Sea and English Channel, respectively. Measurements of the radionuclides 134Cs, 137Cs, 99Tc, 129I, and 236U released from these nuclear plants have been used to determine transit times for the advective flow of water throughout the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean since the 1970s. More recently, these radionuclide tracers have been used to determine mean ages and mixing rates using transit time distribution (TTD) theory to address climate related issues such as the uptake of anthropogenic carbon in the ocean and deep ocean boundary current transport and deep water ventilation.

TI  - Farming the Oceanâ€“Seaweeds as a Quick Fix for the Climate?
AB  - Finding ways to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius is urgent and will need a portfolio of solutions. Seaweeds are marine photosynthetic organisms that humans harvest either from the wild or farm, to be used in many applications and providing various ecosystem services. Large scale farming of seaweeds for absorbing carbon has lately been promoted as a climate â€œfixâ€. The major shortcomings of this argument relate to the idea that a carbon sink function should exist through carbon accumulation in seaweed biomass simultaneously as seaweeds are consumed as food by humans, fed to animals, or used in many alternative applications. This carbon instead enters the fast carbon cycle and does not provide any â€œcarbon sinkâ€ function. Radical suggestions of intentionally transfer of farmed seaweeds to the deep-sea to accomplish a longer removal are highly questionable from feasibility, economic, ecosystem effects and ethical resource use perspectives. Development of â€œocean forestsâ€ for carbon capturing through farming should not be compared to forests on land as these provide carbon removal from the atmosphere at sufficiently long time scales to be qualified as carbon sequestration - thus making a difference related to reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Seaweeds can, however, play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the overall food system through carbon offset - i.e. if replacing food, feed, and/or materials that have larger carbon footprints. The fate/cycling of carbon as particulate and dissolved matter from both farmed and wild seaweeds, are however not fully understood, especially with respect to pathways and time scales relevant for carbon removal/storage. Another potential pathway for their role in decarbonization may be through reducing enteric methane emissions from ruminants and also through bioenergy production. More research is, however, needed for understanding the contributions from such interventions. Presenting seaweed farming as a quick fix for the climate risks facilitating misdirected investments (for carbon abatement solutions) and reducing demand for specific research and technological development that will be needed for increasing our understanding about seaweedsâ€™ contribution to food/feed systems and additional sustainability services and benefits.

TI  - Cyclone models for a submerged breakwater
AB  - Kahului Harbor, located on the north shore of Maui, Hawaii, is approached by waves from the northwest in winter and northeast in summer. Wave energy entering the harbor during large swell events has repeatedly caused damage to existing protective structures and operations. As a result, a 706-meter long breakwater on the west was constructed to provide additional tranquility inside the harbor. A breakwater on the east with an 843-meter length was constructed to protect against waves approaching from north and northeast. However, strong wave energy still damages the harbor through the 12-meter deep and 183-meter wide entrance channel. Consequently, a submerged breakwater could be constructed in order to mitigate the wave energy that continues to damage the pier. The objective of making these models is to determine the most appropriate construction approach for the project based on construction duration and related variable costs. The study also aims to see if the project can be completed within a 5-month window during calm water. Two construction approaches were proposedâ€” (1) using one construction crew per geotextile grid, and (2) using multiple crews per geotextile grid. Sensitivity analyses were performed on both proposed construction approaches by adjusting the number of laborers hired. This report provides the proposed geotextile submerged breakwater details based on construction plans viewed through the simulation models using EZStrobe. Â© 2014 ISEC Press.

TI  - Gas hydrate mitigation using an organic extract in a simulated offshoreenvironment
AB  - As deep-water activities and development into deeper operations (depth of 6,000ft or more) increases,temperatures and pressures become favorable for hydrate nucleation and growth. This results in additionalrisk and challenges as to how to prevent formation of gas hydrates. This paper takes a look at the performanceof a local surfactant derived from plant material in a laboratory mini flow loop made of a 0.5-inch internaldiameter 316 stainless steel pipe enclosed in a 4-inch PVC pipe mounted on an external metal frame work.The performance of the local surfactant (Surf. X) was compared with that of the conventional hydrateinhibitor N-Vinyl Caprolactam (N-VCap). Varying weights of Surf. X were evaluated in the laboratorymini flow loop. Pressure versus Temperature, change in Pressure versus Time plots showed that Surf. Xperformed better than the conventional N-VCap in almost all the concentrations considered (except at 0.04wt%). The optimum concentration for inhibition was 0.02wt% with inhibition efficiency of 81.58% while thatof N-VCap was 77.19%. The inhibition efficiency of Surf. X for 0.01, 0.03 and 0.04wt % were 72.81%and 75.44% respectively. Surf. X is locally sourced, readily available in commercial quantity and also eco-friendly because it is plant based unlike the N-VCap which is toxic and expensive. It is advised that thelocal surfactant X be developed as an alternative to the conventional inhibitor for gas hydrate inhibition. Â© 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Recyclable epoxy systems for rotor blades
AB  - The global energy demand is largely met by power generated from fossil fuels (Thermal Power plants) and nuclear means (Nuclear Power plants). Even though both these technologies have been used for decades, they have huge environmental impact and severe sustainability issues with depleting fossil fuel and serious concerns about the spent nuclear rods disposal. With growing awareness of impact on the environment and finding a sustainable solution for power generation, wind energy offers a lasting solution that addresses both issues, however it is still not truly sustainable as the primary materials used for manufacturing of rotor blades are non-recyclable. A new revolutionary technological solution has been invented where in, the epoxy thermoset can be recovered as thermoplastic and the reinforcement in composite can be re-used, making it a first of its kind in the thermoset industry segment. The Recyclable Epoxy Systems for rotor blades provide a path breaking solution that enables recycling of epoxy thermoset, recovery and re-use of the reinforcement and the matrix in a fibre reinforced composite. Leveraging from the proprietary Recyclamine (R) platform technology, series of recyclable epoxy systems are developed for wet lay-up and infusion processes to meet the requirements for both on-shore and off-shore rotor blades, including next generation rotor blades. The systems are characterized by determining process and performance properties and found to provide distinct advantages in comparison to the conventional non-recyclable epoxy systems. The recycling of composites made from recyclable epoxy systems is successfully demonstrated by low energy solvolysis followed by recovery of the reinforcement and epoxy matrix as thermoplastic. The recovered reinforcement and epoxy thermoplastic are re-used to make composite and representative thermoplastic object respectively, deriving value from the waste and closing the loop to make the wind energy industry sustainable for a circular economy.

TI  - CO2 sequestration in a UK North Sea analogue for geological carbon storage
AB  - The Fizzy discovery, a southern North Sea (UK) gas accumulation with ~50% natural CO2 content, provides an opportunity to study the long-term quantity of CO2-related mineral reaction as an analogue for engineered CO2 storage. The reservoir contains diagenetic dolomite typical of the formation; to identify and quantify any sequestration-related dolomite is challenging. To this end, CO2 was extracted by stepwise extraction from dolomite from both the Fizzy discovery and equivalent sandstones from a low-CO2 location. Between 0% and 22% of the dolomite in the Fizzy discovery precipitated due to the high CO2 concentration. This corresponds to 11% Â± 8% of the recent high-CO2 charge sequestered as dolomite, a relatively low proportion after ~50 m.y. of potential CO2-water-rock interaction.

TI  - Molecular Modeling Study of the SO2Deactivation of an Amine Resin and a Procedure to Avoid SO2Deactivation Using a Polyethylene Glycol/Tertiary Amine System
AB  - Since 2012, the polymeric resin Lewatit R VP OC 1065 has been investigated for removal of CO2 from various process streams and air. The present article focuses on the deactivation mechanism of the resin with SO2 and a work around. This is important for CO2 capture from flue gas of coal-fired power plants and fuel oil. The deactivation of the resin was already experimentally observed in 2013 but thus far not described computationally. Molecular modeling shows that Lewatit R VP OC 1065 is deactivated by irreversible formation of dimeric amine-SO2 charge-transfer complexes which are very stable and resist thermal and chemical desorption. Additional support for this view was found in the work on aminosilica adsorbents for CO2 capture, which are subject to SO2 deactivation also. Therefore, attention was paid to a procedure to avoid SO2 deactivation. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)/tertiary amine systems seem to be very promising. Their reported high SO2/CO2 selectivities, SO2 capacities, and ease of regeneration were computationally confirmed by identifying their mode of action and favorable thermodynamics. As a result, a combination of a PEG/tertiary amine system with Lewatit R VP OC 1065 might be a very attractive candidate two-step process to capture both SO2 and CO2 from flue gas originating from coal-fired power plants and large ships.

TI  - Floating houses - chances and problems
AB  - Floating architecture could be a resolution in the future for current problems in many districts, cities and landscapes. Such problems can be seen particularly in the need for additional housing areas and construction grounds in some countries in Europe and Asia as a result of the growing population and/or the slowly rising sea level in context with the worldwide climate change. Another example for problems of current interest is the use of alternative energies. The water areas of channels and closed down harbours offer good opportunities to create new water landscapes with modern marinas consisting of floating houses and other floating architecture. As this paper will show, this is achieved in the same way that brownfields, such as the pits of former opencast lignite mines, are appropriated for such modern marinas after their transformation into post-mining lakes. Thereby, the possible use of water as an alternative energy source is demonstrated too. On the other hand there are a lot of new problems with regard to the physical and chemical effects of water on the constructions of floating architecture. New materials and structures must be developed in order to withstand the attacks of waves, sea climate, salts and ph-values. The harmonisation between architecture and nature is to be discussed. Moreover, there are questions about energy and water supply, waste disposal and safety. Three years ago a new project was started with regard to these topics. The first results of the investigations supported by experiments and numerical simulations are presented in the paper.

TI  - Gas-eor challenges and proposed solutions for carbonate reservoirs
AB  - Optimizing oil recovery has always been a challenge in the development of the carbonate reservoirs. The residual oil saturation (Ros), available for tertiary recovery, can exceed 25% in some reservoirs, and the classical development approaches are not adapted to recover the remaining oil in place within the limits of economic profitability. Enhancement of oil recovery through carbon dioxide injection (EOR-C02) is among the approaches that are explored since several years. It is based on the increase of miscibility between brine and oil and the disposal of CO2 while improving the oil recovery. This method allows the reduction of the greenhouse emissions, through the sequestration of carbon dioxide. The major oil companies initiated strategic projects in order to increase their revenues through enhancement of oil recovery while contributing to the reduction of the greenhouse emissions through carbon dioxide sequestration. The strength, weaknesses and challenges of such projects have not always made public. The study discusses the geomechanical and the engineering challenges related to the implementation of this project. Copyright 2016, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Numerical simulation of liquid sloshing in floating LNG
AB  - The sloshing impact loads is one of the major design factors for tank containment system in LNG FPSO (Floating production storage and offloading). With the development of offshore natural gas exploration and LNG transportation, the application of FLNG is growing rapidly. Sloshing of LNG cargo results in large impact loads on the containment system and the structure needs to be designed to withstand these peak loads. Liquid sloshing is a complex phenomenon of fluid movement, showing a strong nonlinearity and randomness. Partially filled container which is subjected to external excitation can undergo intense movement, and large impacts on container wall, resulting in structure damage. The earlier sloshing study used experimental methods, but the number and size of tests are subject to great restrictions due to high cost, long period, and complicated operation. In view of this, the development of numerical simulation is necessary. CFD modeling can be reliably used to find the sloshing loads at different sea states, liquid levels and vapor properties, as well optimizing internal baffles to dampen sloshing. The current paper proposes Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method to predict the sloshing loads in FLNG during the ship motion. The proposed CFD method is validated with experiments for the free surface level and the impact pressure during the sloshing in various scenarios. Series of CFD studies were performed to investigate effect of mesh sensitivity, solver options and time step size. A separate study was performed to investigate effect of density ratio on impact pressure. Volume of Fluid (VOF) method along with rigid body motion is used to model the liquid sloshing in a moving container. Validation case studies are chosen in accordance with literature.

TI  - New filter-cake breaker technology maximizes production rates by removing near-wellbore damage zone with delay mechanism designed for high temperature reservoirs: Offshore Abu Dhabi
AB  - This paper discusses the successful design, testing, and application of a new filter-cake breaker technology based on lactic acid chemistry. This technology provided prolonged delay in filter-cake breakthrough time at 220Â°F, which ensured coverage of the entire open hole, improved uniform filter-cake removal, minimized brine losses, and exceeded the expected production rates in different layers of the offshore Abu Dhabi reservoir. Reservoir characterization was a fundamental component in the identification of the proper solution to maximize the return on investment of the assets. Temperature, permeability, porosity, and the nature of the reservoirs were studied thoroughly to determine one solution to be used in different reservoirs. Drilling fluid characterization (non-damaging with proper bridging package) and a proper filter-cake design were crucial to exceed the targeted production of the reservoirs. The paper discusses all steps from the laboratory testing of the breaker, application in different layers of the reservoir, and results obtained from the applications. Lactic acid precursor was confirmed to be the "one fit solution" to cover the different reservoir layers. Because of its chemical structure, the hydrolysis process is slower than other breaker types currently available, which made it possible to maximize the breakthrough time at elevated temperatures, minimize completion fluid losses, and optimize the completion operations. Equally important, as an acid precursor rather than a live acid, this solution enabled the rig site personnel to implement the solution without affecting the health, safety, and environment (HSE) aspects that are fundamental in offshore locations. The possibility of pumping this solution through the rig pits enabled the jobs to be performed without additional equipment generally required for well stimulation. The achievement of these goals, supported by the higher production observed during the flow-back of the well, demonstrated how this solution maximized the return on investment for the assets located offshore Abu Dhabi. The innovative use of lactic acid chemistry in the breaker, as compared to the conventional formic acid precursor breakers that are widely available, provided superior delay at higher bottomhole temperatures (in this case, 220Â°F) because of the slower acid liberation rate.
