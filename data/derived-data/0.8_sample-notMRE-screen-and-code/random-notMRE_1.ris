TI  - A Study of H-Bridge Multilevel Inverter Driven Marine Propulsion System
AB  - On account of non-availability of non-renewable resources, Greenhouse gas emissions, CO2 emissions, environmental aspects increased the utilization of alternative energy resources for marine applications. The current research work fills the need of a typical purpose of social event, tending to clarify the most recent updates, past accomplishments and future focuses of the shipping industry. The main goal is to create a multi-level inverter for a diesel/wind/PV/battery hybrid power system with an induction generator (IG) for a wind-energy conversion system and a synchronous generator (SG) for a diesel-generator (DG) installed in onboard ships. The Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) techniques have been used to get the renewable energies such as solar and wind. Multilevel inverter topologies provide lower THD, lower EMI generation, a better output waveform and higher efficiency for a given output waveform quality. Cascaded H-Bridge topology has been chosen in this research work to design a multilevel inverter. The output of the RES is variable in nature, which is regulated by a hybrid buck boost converter. The regulated DC output is fed to the 13 level H bridge inverter to enhance the performance of the hybrid system. This combination can satisfy the voltage to load in the desired level. H-bridge multilevel inverter improves the voltage profile and simulation results are obtained using Mat lab/Simulink. Results obtained have shown that the system is designed well and the load current and voltage of 9.43% THD rate is maintained in the standard limits for multilevel inverter to get a smooth sinusoidal output.

TI  - Macroalgal Blooms Trigger the Breakdown of Seagrass Blue Carbon
AB  - Intensive macroalgal blooms, a source of labile organic carbon (LOC) induced by coastal nutrient loading in some seagrass ecosystems, create ideal conditions for enhanced recalcitrant organic carbon (ROC) loss via the cometabolism effect. Here, we carried out a 62-day laboratory experiment to see if density-dependent addition of macroalgal biomass can influence the seagrass decomposition process, including seagrass detritus carbon chemistry, greenhouse emissions, and bacterial communities. We found that higher density macroalgal addition stimulated microbes to decompose similar to 20\% more of the seagrass biomass compared to other treatments, which was also reflected in enhanced (similar to twofold) greenhouse gas emissions. Although the composition of the seagrass-associated microbiome communities was unaffected by the addition of macroalgae, we showed that high macroalgal addition caused a relative depletion in the ROC as lignin and lipid compounds, as well as delta C-13 depletion and delta N-15 enrichment of the seagrass detritus. These results suggest that macroalgal blooms may stimulate the remineralization of recalcitrant components of seagrass detritus via cometabolism, possibly through providing available energy or resources for the synthesis of ROC-degrading enzymes within the resident microbial population. This study provides evidence that cometabolism can be a mechanism for leading to reduced seagrass blue carbon sequestration and preservation.

TI  - Considerations for standalone development of small deepwater fields
AB  - This paper describes development planning for the Mirage & Telemark Fields located in 4000-4500 ft WD in the Gulf of Mexico. These fields are relatively small, short lived oil fields with multiple pay zones. Factors driving development planning include: â–  Lack of accessible nearby infrastructure â–  Multiple pay horizons & short field life â–  Limited availability of MODU's for pre-drilling â–  Potential satellite tiebacks in the vicinity â–  Parallel vs. sequential development of the nearby Telemark Field â–  Functionality & Residual value in floating infrastructure These fields have 2-4 pay zones in each well, so a dry tree concept was preferred. Because the floating platform design life is over 20 years vs. estimated field life of only 5-7 years, the development facilities need to be designed for convenient relocation to other deepwater fields in order to maximize residual value. The MinDOC3 (Minimum Deepwater Operating Concept) hull was selected for field development because of flexibility, functionality and ability to fabricate in the US Gulf Coast. Hull construction required installation of the first graving dock for offshore construction in the US Gulf Coast. Copyright 2010, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Us and them
AB  - The government was highly aware of the calamitous effects that global warming might have on the population of the country if they did not embrace a greener way to produce power. Unless they found a way to do so, they had been assured that the country would be faced with the prospect of warmer temperatures and higher sea levels, both of which would cause catastrophes of sizable proportions. The people who lived in that country could not fault the argument of those in charge. They accepted the fact that they would need to pay a premium for the electricity from the renewable energy plants and they acknowledged the reality that the electric cars would be more expensive than their internal combustion counterparts. But as painful as those additional costs might be, they also realized that the new green power plants and their all-electric electric vehicles would free them from the shackles of supplies from rogue nations and help to save the country from overheating and floods to boot.

TI  - Plasmon Ag-Promoted solar-thermal conversion on floating carbon cloth for seawater desalination and sewage disposal
AB  - Using solar energy to achieve seawater desalination and sewage disposal has received tremendous attention for its potential possibility to produce clean freshwater. However, the low solar-thermal conversion efficiency for solar absorber materials obstacles their practical applications. Herein, Ag nanoparticles modified floating carbon cloth (ANCC) are first synthesized via wet impregnation, photoreduction, and low-temperature drying strategy, which could float on the water and absorb the solar energy efficiently. It is worth noting that vaporization rate of ANCC with a high wide-spectrum absorption (92.39%) for the entire range of optical spectrum (200-2500 nm) is up to 1.36 kg h -1 m -2 under AM 1.5, which corresponds to solar-thermal conversion efficiency of 92.82% with superior seawater desalination and sewage disposal performance. Plasmon Ag promotes the conversion efficiency obviously compared to the pristine carbon cloth because the surface plasmon resonance effect could increase the local temperature greatly. After the desalination, the ion concentrations (Mg 2+ , K + , Ca 2+ , and Na + ions) in water are far below the limit of drinking water. Such high-performance floating ANCC material may offer a feasible and paradigm strategy to manage the global water contamination and freshwater shortage problem. Â© 2019 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Self-organized sulfide-driven traveling pulses shape seagrass meadows
AB  - Seagrasses provide multiple ecosystem services and act as intense carbon sinks in coastal regions around the globe but are threatened by multiple anthropogenic pressures, leading to enhanced seagrass mortality that reflects in the spatial self-organization of the meadows. Spontaneous spatial vegetation patterns appear in such different ecosystems as drylands, peatlands, salt marshes, or seagrass meadows, and the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are still an open question in many cases. Here, we report on the formation of vegetation traveling pulses creating complex spatiotemporal patterns and rings in Mediterranean seagrass meadows. We show that these structures emerge due to an excitable behavior resulting from the coupled dynamics of vegetation and porewater hydrogen sulfide, toxic to seagrass, in the sediment. The resulting spatiotemporal patterns resemble those formed in other physical, chemical, and biological excitable media, but on a much larger scale. Based on theory, we derive a model that reproduces the observed seascapes and predicts the annihilation of these circular structures as they collide, a distinctive feature of excitable pulses. We show also that the patterns in field images and the empirically resolved radial profiles of vegetation density and sediment sulfide concentration across the structures are consistent with predictions from the theoretical model, which shows these structures to have diagnostic value, acting as a harbinger of the terminal state of the seagrass meadows prior to their collapse.

TI  - Should TBT continue to be considered an issue in dredging port areas? A brief review of the global evidence
AB  - Dredging is periodically required to keep channels and maneuvering basins open in many ports around the world. However, the dredging of contaminated sediments may turn this routine procedure into a source of pollution in the receiving water bodies. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organic or organometallic compounds are present in high concentrations due to human activities in the coastal areas, where ports are located. Thus, the risks posed by dredging should be carefully evaluated for the conservation of environmental quality. Organotin compounds were extensively used as antifouling biocides worldwide for decades, causing considerable damage to localized coastal areas before being banned by IMO in 2008. Afterward, organotin concentrations decreased in most studied areas, as indicated by several recent studies in the literature. In some instances, however, there are still instances of biological effects of organotins application or legacy pollution being reported. It could be argued that until a complete recovery could be inferred, these ``hot spots{''} should have organotins included in the evaluation of possible environmental impacts of dredging activities. Besides, when considering naval activities, most currently used antifouling systems still included biocides. The possible risks posed by these alternative technologies should be evaluated in the same way. This article briefly reviews this argument, using the recent literature on this subject.

TI  - Renewable energy in India: Current status and future potentials
AB  - Renewable energy sources and technologies have potential to provide solutions to the long-standing energy problems being faced by the developing countries. The renewable energy sources like wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, ocean energy, biomass energy and fuel cell technology can be used to overcome energy shortage in India. To meet the energy requirement for such a fast growing economy, India will require an assured supply of 3-4 times more energy than the total energy consumed today. The renewable energy is one of the options to meet this requirement. Today, renewable account for about 33% of India's primary energy consumptions. India is increasingly adopting responsible renewable energy techniques and taking positive steps towards carbon emissions, cleaning the air and ensuring a more sustainable future. In India, from the last two and half decades there has been a vigorous pursuit of activities relating to research, development, demonstration, production and application of a variety of renewable energy technologies for use in different sectors. In this paper, efforts have been made to summarize the availability, current status, major achievements and future potentials of renewable energy options in India. This paper also assesses specific policy interventions for overcoming the barriers and enhancing deployment of renewables for the future. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The thermal regime around buried submarine high-voltage cables
AB  - The expansion of offshore renewable energy infrastructure and the need for trans-continental shelf power transmission require the use of submarine high-voltage (HV) cables. These cables have maximum operating surface temperatures of up to 70Â°C and are typically buried 1-2 m beneath the seabed, within the wide range of substrates found on the continental shelf. However, the heat flow pattern and potential effects on the sedimentary environments around such anomalously high heat sources in the near-surface sediments are poorly understood. We present temperature measurements from a 2-D laboratory experiment representing a buried submarine HV cable, and identify the thermal regimes generated within typical unconsolidated shelf sediments-coarse silt, fine sand and very coarse sand. We used a large (2 Ã— 2.5 m2) tank filled with water-saturated spherical glass beads (ballotini) and instrumented with a buried heat source and 120 thermocouples to measure the time-dependent 2-D temperature distributions. The observed and corresponding Finite Element Method simulations of the steady state heat flow regimes and normalized radial temperature distributions were assessed. Our results show that the heat transfer and thus temperature fields generated from submarine HV cables buried within a range of sediments are highly variable. Coarse silts are shown to be purely conductive, producing temperature increases of &gt;10Â°C up to 40 cm from the source of 60Â°C above ambient; fine sands demonstrate a transition from conductive to convective heat transfer between cf. 20 and 36Â°C above ambient, with &gt;10Â°C heat increases occurring over a metre from the source of 55Â°C above ambient; and very coarse sands exhibit dominantly convective heat transfer even at very low (cf. 7Â°C) operating temperatures and reaching temperatures of up to 18Â°C above ambient at a metre from the source at surface temperatures of only 18Â°C. These findings are important for the surrounding near-surface environments experiencing such high temperatures and may have significant implications for chemical and physical processes operating at the grain and subgrain scale; biological activity at both microfaunal and macrofaunal levels; and indeed the operational performance of the cables themselves, as convective heat transport would increase cable current ratings, something neglected in existing standards.

TI  - A Code of Conduct Is Imperative for Ocean Carbon Dioxide Removal Research
AB  - As the impacts of rising temperatures mount and the global transition to clean energy advances only gradually, scientists and policymakers are looking towards carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. Attention has increasingly focused on ocean CDR techniques, which enhance or restore marine systems to sequester carbon. Ocean CDR research presents the risk of uncertain impacts to human and environmental welfare, yet there are no domestic regulations aimed at ensuring the safety and efficacy of this research. A code of conduct that establishes principles of responsible research, fairness, and equity is needed in this field. This article presents fifteen key components of an ocean CDR research code of conduct.

TI  - Development of a Constructed Wetland Water Treatment System for Selenium Removal: Use of Mesocosms to Evaluate Design Parameters
AB  - The Salton Sea in California is an important habitat for fish and waterfowl. Its ecosystem is threatened due to diminishing water supplies and increasing. salinity. An alternative source of water to support species conservation habitat may be obtained from local rivers (e.g., Alamo or New Rivers), provided that a wetland treatment system can be developed to remove selenium (Se), fertilizer nutrients, and other contaminants. Here, we used mesocosms to evaluate a number of potential design options (e.g., plant species selection, sediment composition and arrangement, forced aeration, organic amendments, etc.) to improve the efficiency of Se removal using treatment wetlands. Our results show that, of five different substrate arrangements tested for Se removal, the most efficient was obtained for cattails growing in a substrate of cattail litter overlying sand and peat moss sediment (water column Se was reduced from 15 mu g Se/L to <0.1 mu g Se/L in 72 h). The addition of organic amendments in the form of alfalfa hay or alfalfa meal was also helpful in lowering Se levels. These results suggest that it may be possible to design constructed wetland water treatment systems capable of reducing Se concentrations in river water to values below 1 mu g Se/L.

TI  - A Modular Multilevel Converter with Integrated Composite Energy Storage for Ship MVDC Electric Propulsion System
AB  - In order to satisfy the demands of ship high-power electric propulsion system and energy storage system of a medium voltage direct current (MVDC) based ship integrated power system (IPS), a modular multilevel converter with integrated composite energy storage (MMC-ICES) is proposed in this paper. In order to pursue both fast power response and longtime power supply, both batteries and super-capacitors are integrated into the MMC to form a composite energy storage. Therefore, it can not only compensate the pulse power of high-energy equipment in a ship, solve the low-frequency voltage fluctuation problem of sub-module capacitors when the MMC drives a propulsion motor under low speed high torque condition, but also provide emergency power supply under ship grid fault condition. The decoupled control method is discussed in detail and verified by simulation results in this paper. Â© 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Changes in organic carbon source and storage with sea level rise-induced transgression in a Chesapeake Bay marsh
AB  - Organic matter (OM) accumulation in marsh soils affects marsh survival under rapid sea-level rise (SLR). This work describes the changing organic geochemistry of a salt marsh located in the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay that has transgressed inland with SLR over the past 35-75 years. Marsh soils and vegetation were sampled along an elevation gradient from the intertidal zone to the adjacent forest, representing a space-for-time substitution of the process of marsh transgression. Stable carbon isotope analysis of bulk OM gives evidence for a transition from C3 upland-sourced OM to C4-dominated marsh vegetation over time. The vegetative source of the OM changes along a marsh-upland mixing line from herbaceous angiosperm-sourced lignin in the lower elevation marsh to a woody gymnosperm signature at the upper border of the marsh. The results of stable isotope and lignin analyses illustrate that landward encroachment of marsh grasses results in deposition of herbaceous tissues exhibiting relatively little decay. This presents a possible mechanism for OM stabilization as marshes migrate inland. Regional index terms: USA, Maryland, Chesapeake Bay, Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.

TI  - Managing Shipboard Energy: A Stochastic Approach Special Issue on Marine Systems Electrification
AB  - The efficient utilization of energy is of high importance for shipboard applications, for environmental and economic reasons as well as maximized vessel operation. The electrification of marine systems facilitates the storage and generation of energy from multiple sources, offering the potential for energy savings, due to the flexibility associated with electric systems. In this paper, an energy management system (EMS) based on bond graph system models used in conjunction with a stochastic search algorithm is proposed and developed. The EMS optimizes the configuration of the vessel's onboard machinery system based on the current operating condition. The approach is universal, with the system model and optimization routine being separate and distinct. The effectiveness of the proposed EMS is demonstrated using a real operating profile of a roll-on/roll-off vessel fitted with a hybrid machinery configuration including energy storage, onshore power supply, and photovoltaic generation. The results show fuel savings of around 23\% compared with current fuel consumption levels.

TI  - TLP design philosophy - Past, present, future
AB  - The paper starts with capturing the situation of inventive engineering caused by the transfer of mature offshore technology from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Sea during the early 70's. This period coincided with the early stages of TLP development and it is suggested that the TLP is a product of this rather unique situation. Some of the reasoning of tether design of this early period is outlined. The 5 TLPs now having been build are being discussed especially in the context of the early reasoning on TLP design and with the emphasis on the tethers. It is indicated how a kind of design consensus has been evolved. Regarding future TLPs it is suggested that the present design consensus should be critically scrutinised to remove any extravaganza which are not strictly required for safety or operational reasons. A few areas which could be scrutinised are discussed. The paper is somewhat subjective in trying to explain why certain critical decisions have been made. In some cases there may be other reasons which the authors will not be aware of. The purpose of the paper, however, is to inspire fresh thinking into developing future TLPs by trying to go through the arguments of the past and the present. The views expressed in this paper are personal and only those of the authors. Â© 1995 by The International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers.

TI  - Quantifying shoot and root biomass production and soil carbon under perennial bioenergy grasses in a subtropical environment
AB  - Perennial bioenergy grasses can potentially replace fossil fuels and offset atmospheric CO2 through soil C sequestration. However, limited information relevant to the impacts of bioenergy cropping on ecosystem services, especially above-and below-ground productivity and soil C sequestration is available for subtropical environments (e.g., southeastern USA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of perennial bioenergy cropping on C cycling and accumulation in the soil following four years of production in North Florida. Treatments consisted of six perennial grass species: giant reed, elephantgrass, energycane, sugarcane, sweetcane, and giant miscanthus. Elephantgrass, energycane, sweetcane, and sugarcane produced great shoot biomass (31-41 Mg ha(-1)) when harvested once per year. Giant reed's shoot biomass responded favorably to two harvests per year (27-43 Mg ha(-1)), whereas giant miscanthus did not perform well in any of the years (9-21 Mg ha(-1)). Additionally, giant reed, sweetcane, and giant miscanthus produced greater root biomass (9-11 Mg ha(-1)) compared with the other three species (2.5-3.2 Mg ha(-1)). Among the six grasses, sweetcane, energycane, and elephantgrass resulted in increases in soil C stocks (similar to 15 Mg ha(-1)) relative to the initial level. Conversely, giant reed and giant miscanthus had no increase in soil C stock. Results suggested that interspecies differences observed in biomass yield among the six perennial bioenergy grasses could therefore affect soil C accumulation. High biomass yielding species such as sweetcane, energycane, and elephantgrass can effectively increase soil C within a few years following establishment in a subtropical environment.

TI  - Further weight and cost saving of fire and blast resistant walls on offshore installations, through the new, 4th type and a comprehensive decision making model
AB  - This paper presents an overview of 50 years of development of fire and blast resistant walls for offshore installations and introduces the fourth generation or "Type" of wall. This thoroughly tested and certified 4th Type was developed as a response to the continuous quest to further optimise the cost and weight of offshore topsides, thus allowing operators and designers to accommodate more equipment and higher field yield. Inductive research indicates that the selection of a fire and blast resistant wall design amongst the available Types is very often biased and predominantly based on past experience. As such, the traditionally selected option has been a monocoque structural design incorporating load bearing walls instead of framed construction designs with non-load bearing infill walls. This bias can lead to sub-optimal design and execution of offshore installations. This paper reflects on 4 Types of offshore fire and blast walls. From the 1st Type, derived from the shipbuilding industry up to the 4th Type, initially used on recent offshore wind HVDC transformer platforms and more recently also on the oil and gas platforms as a response to the continuous need to reduce weight and improve on safety. This 4th Type, with a weight of just 25 kg/m2, is certified as capable of withstanding up to 2 hour hydrocarbon fires and has been tested with a considerable free span. In this paper, all 4 Types of walls are assessed against a limited series of hard and soft performance criteria, according to a decision making model which can be used to select the fittest-for-purpose Type of wall system. This model includes the distinction between internal fire walls, external fire walls and external fire and blast walls.

TI  - The politics of climate change in Germany: Ambition versus lobby power
AB  - In 30 years of climate policy in Germany, a high level of declared ambition has coexisted with an eclectic mix of climate policy measures. Well-organized lobbies were either exempt from policy instruments such as the energy tax or directly benefitted from them, as in the case of the renewable feed-in tariff or windfall profits from free allocation of emissions allowances. As a result, German emissions mitigation is much more costly than it would have to be. Moreover, the challenges because of the imminent phase-out of nuclear power are increasing due to failures in a number of relevant policy fields such as offshore wind, grid reinforcement, and carbon capture and storage (CCS).

A major concern for all forms of electricity generation is their effects of carbon emissions and, as a result which is now generally recognised, on global warming. The present paper makes use of published sources of carbon emissions data to estimate the carbon content of each of the operations required to produce, transport, construct, operate and decommission this barrage if it is located and designed as set out in 1989. The approach adopted here is based on estimating the ratio of the life-cycle carbon emissions demand of the scheme (gCO2) relative to its energy output (kW) over an assumed lifetime, this to include expected plant replacements over that period.

TI  - Addressing Concerns Related to the Use of Ethanol-Blended Fuels in Marine Vehicles
AB  - Ethanol blended fuels have become increasingly prevalent in the on-road transportation sector due to the benefits they provide in energy security, sustainability and reduced environmental impact. However, ethanol usage has led to material compatibility concerns causing corrosion and degradation in materials that are commonly used in engines and fuel storage/delivery systems. The on-road transportation sector continues to study and develop alternatives to minimize potential material challenges. Although, marine vehicles represent a smaller segment of the transportation sector, they represent many vehicles, particularly in the United States. Concerns related to the use of ethanol blended fuels in the marine environment have been expressed by many individuals and groups. Unfortunately, relatively little work has gone into the study of gasoline mixed with approximately 10\% ethanol usage and potential material incompatibilities in marine engines. The objective of this article is to provide some factual answers to these concerns. In order to understand the extent of material incompatibilities, a literature survey of published material compatibility data and marine engine manufacturer recommendations was conducted. Next field samples of marine fuels were gathered to estimate the extent of ethanol usage in marine gasoline. Finally, samples of new and in-use marine components were exposed to either gasoline mixed with approximately 10\% ethanol or gasoline with 0\% ethanol for 1,960 hours to determine whether gasoline mixed with approximately 10\% ethanol presented degradation beyond that seen with gasoline (gasoline with 0\% ethanol) alone. This work has shown that many marine engine manufacturers have used ethanol compatible materials in current products and that exposure of older marine engine components to gasoline mixed with approximately 10\% ethanol by did not reveal any significant degradation. Finally, marine fuel samples gathered in 2013, reveal that most marine gasoline sold in the Unites States does not contain significant levels of ethanol.

TI  - Investigation on in Situ Foam Technology for Enhanced Oil Recovery in Offshore Oilfield
AB  - An in situ CO2 foams (ISCF) formula is presented to investigate its performance in enhancing oil recovery in homogeneous and heterogeneous formations. Surfactant evaluation, sandpack flooding, and microscopic visualization experiments were carried out to determine the biological surfactant for ISCF formula and confirm the feasibility and mechanism in oil recovery improvement. The results showed that biological surfactant A2 had a good foaming performance even in extremely saline solutions of greater than 2.5 Ã— 105 ppm, acid solutions of concentration 20%, and high-temperature environment of 100 Â°C. The ISCF system had a good recovery efficiency in homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media. The SARA test confirmed the generated CO2 by chemical reaction could extract the heavy components which led to about 8% viscosity reduction, the inner pressure distribution indicated that ISCF had a better further blocking ability than conventional foam, the average diversion ratio curves demonstrated that ISCF system had a distinct effect on conformance control even in the presence of crude oil, the 2D micromodel experiment revealed that the generated foam was uniform and could occupy a wider pore space, and the permeability variation of produced liquids analysis presented that the even distribution of acid in homogeneous and heterogeneous formations can also contribute to the blockage removal and oil recovery improvement.

AB  - Estuarine mangrove wetlands are generally considered a major source of methane (CH4) emissions. Anaerobic methane oxidation (AMO) is an important pathway for reducing CH4 emissions and is known to be tightly linked to carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and metal cycling processes largely driven by microorganisms. However, these coupled processes and their contributions to mitigating global warming remain unclear in mangrove wetlands. In this study, the depth-specific potential methane oxidation rates of nitrate-, nitrite- and nitrous oxide-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (nitrate-, nitrite- and N2O-AMO) and sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (sulfate-AMO) processes were investigated using stable isotope tracing along with an assessment of the vertical nutrient and CH4 content profiles in mangrove sediments. The results indicated that nitrite-AMO, nitrate-AMO, N2O-AMO and sulfate-AMO were active and exhibited methane oxidation rates varying from 24.1 to 1077.4, 14.1 to 66.1, 14.3 to 40.9 and 4.2â€“36.7 nmol CO2 gâˆ’1 dry soil dâˆ’1, respectively. Furthermore, nitrite-AMO and N2O-AMO tended to be more active in the upper sediment layers, while nitrate-AMO and sulfate-AMO displayed higher rates in the deeper layers. The contribution rate of nitrite-AMO to the total of the 4 AMO processes examined in the mangrove sediments reached 28.90â€“95.80%, followed by nitrate-AMO (2.73â€“46.46%), sulfate-AMO (1.46â€“24.65%) and N2O-AMO (1.70â€“4.47%), suggesting that the nitrite-AMO process is a significant methane sink in mangrove wetland ecosystems. The temporal and spatial variations in the nitrite-AMO bacterial depth and genus-specific distribution, abundance, activity and sensitivity to environmental factors were then investigated. The absolute abundances of the nitrite-AMO bacterial 16S rRNA and pmoA genes were 0.51â€“6.55 Ã— 107 and 0.79â€“8.43 Ã— 106 copies gâˆ’1 ds, respectively, and these values decreased with sediment depth; most of the samples were characterized as belonging to Group B of NC10. In addition, NO2âˆ’ is the limiting factor for nitrite-AMO bacteria in mangrove wetlands. Â© 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Evaluation of clayed silt properties on the behavior of hydrate production in South China Sea
AB  - Gas hydrate is one kind of potential energy resources that is buried under deep seafloor or frozen areas. The first trial offshore production from the silty reservoir was conducted in the South China Sea by the China Geological Survey (CGS). During this test, there were many unique characteristics different from the sand reservoir, which was believed to be related to the clayed silt physical properties. In this paper, simulation experiments, facilities analysis, and theoretical calculation were used to confirm the hydrate structure, reservoir thermo-physical property, and bond water movement rule. And the behavior of how they affected production efficiency was analyzed. The results showed that: It was reasonable to use the structure I rather than structure II methane hydrate phase equilibrium data to make the production plan; the dissociation heat absorbed by hydrate was large enough to cause hydrate self-protection or reformation depend on the reservoir thermal transfer and gas supply; clayed silt got better thermal conductivity compared to coarse grain, but poor thermal convection especially with hydrate; clayed silt sediment was easy to bond water, but the irreducible water can be exchanged to free water under high production pressure, and the most obvious pressure range of water increment was 1.9-4.9 MPa.

TI  - Use of premium connection to justify avoiding pressure testing completion tubing prior to setting packer. Is this always correct?
AB  - Pressure testing completion tubing prior to setting the production packer has been an accepted procedure in the past. However, over the years, complications and time (cost) to run a plug (on slick line) in high angle wells plus the advent of premium tubing connection and use of torque-turn monitor has made that practice almost redundant. Reliance on a metal to metal seal provided by premium connection, mill end quality control and tubing thread inspection are the main reasons for avoiding completion tubing pressure test prior to setting production packer. This paper described the painful recovery, costing over US$ 4.8 million from a tubing connection leak despite the use of premium connection and torque-turn monitoring system. Troubleshooting the location of the leak is time consuming. Is the packer leaking or any of the completion components or the tubing leaking? In this case one of the 13 Cr completion tubing connection was leaky. The completion string had an Integral Tubing Conveyed Perforation gun below the retrievable packer so it was time consuming and risky to retrieve tubing completion with a life gun. Over 40% of tubing had to be rejected due to galled thread when the completion was pulled. A description of field trouble shooting the leak location is described. Analysis of the torqueturn graph and reasons for imperfect tubing make up causing the leak are discussed. Simulating field make-up process at the Yard and pressure testing the made-up premium connection are described. Lessons learned are presented. Â© 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - The role of tidal salt marsh as an energy source for marine transient and resident finfishes: A stable isotope approach
AB  - Stable isotope ratios of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (delta(13)C, delta(15)N, and delta(34)S) in bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli and white perch Morons americana from Delaware Bay were a function of capture location and, for restored tidal salt marshes, possibly a function of the relative position of the marsh restoration trajectory. White perch collected in polyhaline restoration and reference (Moore's Beach) sites had stable isotope signatures that reflected contributions from both benthic microalgae and Spartina alterniflora. Isotope values from white perch captured at the reference site were slightly enriched compared with those captured at the restoration sites. At upper estuary oligo-mesohaline locations, Phragmites australis contributed to the isotopic composition of both species. Although P. australis was not dominant at the reference marsh (Mad Horse Creek), it also seemed to influence the dow of nutrients into these species. White perch were not collected in open waters of Delaware Bay, but bay anchovy were abundant at offshore sampling stations. A striking result of this study was that stable isotopes that originated in macrophytes and benthic microalgae of salt marshes occurred ubiquitously among bay anchovy collected several kilometers from shore. Interestingly, fish from Mad Horse Creek, a reference marsh where Phragmites was abundant only along creek banks, were intermediate in their isotopic composition. Although benthic microalgal signatures varied both within and among sites, the isotopic composition of bay anchovy and white perch was clearly influenced by these primary producers across all marsh types. Particulate organic matter (POM) appeared to play a lesser role in bay anchovy and white perch nutrition, although depletion of POM sulfur due to the presence of inorganic sulfur may have led to underestimates of the contribution of phytoplankton. Further studies are required to elucidate the relative role of phytoplankton in the trophodynamics of these species.

TI  - Ecosystem-based fisheries management forestalls climate-driven collapse
AB  - Climate change is impacting fisheries worldwide with uncertain outcomes for food and nutritional security. Using management strategy evaluations for key US fisheries in the eastern Bering Sea we find that Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) measures forestall future declines under climate change over non-EBFM approaches. Yet, benefits are species-specific and decrease markedly after 2050. Under high-baseline carbon emission scenarios (RCP 8.5), end-of-century (2075-2100) pollock and Pacific cod fisheries collapse in >70\% and >35\% of all simulations, respectively. Our analysis suggests that 2.1-2.3 degrees C (modeled summer bottom temperature) is a tipping point of rapid decline in gadid biomass and catch. Multiyear stanzas above 2.1 degrees C become commonplace in projections from -2030 onward, with higher agreement under RCP 8.5 than simulations with moderate carbon mitigation (i.e., RCP 4.5). We find that EBFM ameliorates climate change impacts on fisheries in the near-term, but long-term EBFM benefits are limited by the magnitude of anticipated change.

TI  - The significance of the erosion-induced terrestrial carbon sink
AB  - Estimating carbon (C) balance in erosional and depositional landscapes is complicated by the effects of soil redistribution on both net primary productivity (NPP) and decomposition. Recent studies are contradictory as to whether soil erosion does or does not constitute a C sink. Here we clarify the conceptual basis for how erosion can constitute a C sink. Specifically, the criterion for an erosional C sink is that dynamic replacement of eroded C, and reduced decomposition rates in depositional sites, must together more than compensate for erosional losses. This criterion is in fact met in many erosional settings, and thus erosion and deposition can make a net positive contribution to C sequestration. We show that, in a cultivated Mississippi watershed and a coastal California watershed, the magnitude of the erosion-induced C sink is likely to be on the order of 1% of NPP and 16% of eroded C. Although soil erosion has serious environmental impacts, the annual erosion-induced C sink offsets up to 10% of the global fossil fuel emissions of carbon dioxide for 2005.

TI  - Applying an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm to ship energy saving
AB  - Due to the increasingly competitive maritime market and stringent regulatory requirements, the optimization of ship energy efficiency is attracting more and more attention. The energy efficiency of ship navigation is affected by many factors such as ship structure, crew operation and navigation environment. In this paper, the proposed improved second-order oscillating PSO algorithm is used to study the ship energy efficiency from the viewpoint of route optimization by considering the sea conditions and constraints. Firstly, a nonlinear optimization model for ship FOC (fuel oil consumption) considering the time-varying sea state is established. On this basis, the energy efficiency and economic benefits are analyzed in terms of multiple indicators e.g., FOC and CO2 emissions per unit distance and per unit mass of freight. Finally, the energy saving potential of the method is demonstrated with an example of an oil tanker. The results show that both FOC and emissions are reduced after optimization, and energy efficiency and economy are improved by 1.17% and 2.55%, respectively. This indicated that the considerable effect of the proposed method applied to ship energy saving optimization. Â© 2022

TI  - Design of a 1.4 mgd desalination plant based on MSF and RO processes for an arid area in India
AB  - Although India receives an average rainfall of 100 cm, some parts of the country get only scanty rains and are subject to chronic water shortages. Due to the occasional failure of the monsoons, a drinking water problem in these areas becomes quite acute. Water has to be brought in tankers and railway wagons to meet the drinking water needs of the people. With the advent of desalination technology based on both thermal and membrane processes, it is being considered as an alternate source to provide/augment the drinking water sources in the coastal water scarce areas. R &amp; D work carried out at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) on desalination in the last 10â€“15 y has resulted in the development of technology for brackish water and seawater desalination in the country. Operation of pilot plants based on both membrane and thermal desalination has provided useful data for the design of large-scale desalination plants. This paper gives the details of a 1.4 mgd (6300 m3/d) desalination plant to be installed in a coastal area for augmenting the drinking water supply. This consists of a 1.0 mgd multi-stage flash (MSF) and a 0.4 mgd two-stage reverse osmosis (RO) plant based on an indigenously available cellulosic membrane. A two-stage RO process is required in view of moderate salt rejection of cellulose acetate membranes for seawater feed. These membranes, however, possess better chlorine tolerance and fouling resistance compared to TFC membranes. As such this system is more appropriate under Indian conditions. The steam for the MSF plant will be available from a thermal power station where the plant is to be set up. Part of the product water obtained from the MSF plant will be used for entire boiler feed make up of the power station (in lieu of obtaining steam and power for the desalination plant). The remaining product water from the MSF plant (around 0.6 mgd) and RO plant (0.4 mgd) will be blended to get potable water of 250 ppm TDS. The MSF and RO plants are based on indigenous technology using most of the materials and equipment made locally. The detail design aspects and the cost estimates are presented in the paper.

TI  - Influence of pump noise on the health of fish in a large pumping station
AB  - The axial flow pump, characteristic of a large flow, is widely used in pumping stations of hydraulic engineering. However, the internal noise of the axial-flow pump of a high sound pressure level is notable, with a great influence on the fishing livelihood. At present, the studies of the impact of the noise on fish are mainly focused on the explosion, the offshore wind power plant, the ship and other fields, with little attention on the noise generated by the pumping station. This paper applies the combination of the computational fluid dynamics and the Actran to study the sound pressure level distribution in the high-noise area inside the axial-flow pump and the noise distribution in the downstream areas of the pumping station. Extensive comparisons are made of the hearing threshold and the hearing damage threshold of fish, and it is revealed that the noise inside the axial-flow pump exceeds the hearing damage threshold of fish, which could lead to the hearing damage of over-pumped fish. Further, the noises emitted from the pumping station to the downstream are beyond the fish hearing threshold and will also have a significant impact on the fish around the pumping station. This study can provide a reference for studying the impact of the noise generated by various large-scale water transfer projects on fish.

TI  - Energy direct inputs and greenhouse gas emissions of the main industrial trawl fishery of Brazil
AB  - This study provides first-time estimates of direct fuel inputs and greenhouse gas emissions produced by the trawl fishing fleet operating off southeastern and southern Brazil. Analyzed data comprised vessel characteristics, landings, fishing areas and trawling duration of 10,144 fishing operations monitored in Santa Catarina State from 2003 to 2011. Three main fishing strategies were differentiated: 'shrimp trawling', 'slope trawling' and 'pair trawling'. Jointly these operations burned over 9.1 million liters of diesel to land 342.3 million kilograms of fish and shellfish. Annually, 0.023-0.031l were consumed for every kg of catch landed. Because all fishing strategies relied on multispecific catches to raise total incomes, estimates of fuel use intensity were generally low but increased 200-900% if only nominal targets were considered. In nine years, trawling operations emitted 6.69 GgC to the atmosphere, between 2300 and 3300tons CO 2 per year. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Well safety and integrity evaluation of offshore wells: A review of past, present, and future
AB  - Accidents play an important role in the oil and gas industry because, among other consequences, they redefine definitions of safety. One of them is the Macondo accident, which happened in 2010 and changed the industry dramatically in terms of well safety and integrity. This work provides a literature review of well safety and integrity, divided into three eras: ``the past{''} (pre-Macondo), ``the present{'' (post-Macondo), and ``the future{''} (digitalization and carbon neutrality). Our goal is to highlight the changes that the industry has undergone due to this event but also due to recent trends such as digitalization and carbon neutrality. The introduction contains a glossary of relevant definitions that are widely used in these subjects. The past reviews well integrity systems that companies had before the Macondo accident, illustrating their deficiencies compared to current systems. We also present available regulations, standards, and guidelines and what changed in them due to the accident. The present reviews current well integrity management systems (WIMS), their architectures, and studies of selected well barrier elements (fluid, BOP, wellhead, rock, and primary cementing). Finally, the future reviews ongoing trends such as the use of digitalization (through digital twins) to monitor and assess well integrity and the deployment of CCUS (carbon capture, utilization, and storage) wells to achieve carbon neutrality.

TI  - QICS Work Package 1: Migration and trapping of CO2 from a reservoir to the seabed or land surface
AB  - Natural CO2 seeps can be used as analogues for studies into surface flux and impact resulting from leaking engineered geological CO2 reservoirs. However their long-lived nature often means that the local environment has either adapted or evolved around the seepage site. The `Quantifying Impact of Carbon Storage' (QICS) experiment. provides the solution to this issue by releasing CO2 into an environment previously untouched by CO2. Work Package 1 (WP1) of the QICS project is primarily concerned with the migration of CO2 in the subsurface and how to relate the results of the relatively shallow experiment to a full storage scale setting in the UK North Sea. The main objectives of WP1 are to investigate potential leakage pathways from the reservoir to the surface, determine possible leakage rates and assess the potential volumes of leaked CO2 that can reach the surface environment.

TI  - Carbon stocks in aboveground biomass for Colombian mangroves with associated uncertainties
AB  - Decision-making process, as well as the implementation of future climate change mitigation strategies for mangrove ecosystems, need the availability of reliable base information and tools to estimate the carbon stocks at regional and national levels. We estimated carbon (C) stocks in aboveground biomass (AGB) for mangroves in the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Colombia. Using available data on AGB density and mangrove area for the whole country (excluding islands) and each coast independently, we estimated a national carbon stock in AGB for Colombian mangroves as 14.95 +/- 2.72 TgC (mean +/- SE), with 2.20 +/- 0.86 TgC in the Caribbean coast and 9.61 +/- 2.78 TgC in the Pacific coast. Uncertainty for total carbon in AGB in Colombian mangroves, reported as SE/mean in percentage, was 18\% at the national level, 39\% in the Caribbean coast, and 29\% in the Pacific coast. This uncertainty was more influenced by uncertainties associated with the estimation of mangrove area for the Caribbean coast, while for the Pacific coast it was more influenced by the uncertainties associated with AGB density. This difference is the result of a contrasting availability of AGB density data for both coasts. Comparison between observed AGB density data and predictions from large-scale models showed that these models underestimate AGB density for Colombian mangroves. We reparameterized these models with our data, but found poor goodness-offit statistics for these model structures. We propose therefore three new statistical models to predict AGB density in Colombian mangroves based on climatic and vegetation data. In all cases, the best models included the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and the mean temperature of driest quarter (BIO9). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Reforming International Fisheries Law Can Increase Blue Carbon Sequestration
AB  - The oceans are by far the largest carbon sink and are estimated to have absorbed roughly 40 percent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions since the beginning of the industrial era. The climate services performed by the oceans can be described as an interaction between a physical and a biological carbon pump. Whereas the role of the physical carbon pump is well established, the full scale of the climate services provided by the biological carbon pump has only recently been understood. This pump is made up of services provided by different marine species, from microbes to marine mammals. Many of these species are managed under the international law of the sea and subject to the concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Although the MSY concept has developed since its inception, maximum generation of fish for human consumption remains the core objective according to the law of the sea. Under MSY based management, states are not required to consider the climate services represented by different marine organisms, making this regime unable to balance the interest of maximizing fish as a product against the oceansâ€™ role in carbon sequestration. In order to make optimal use of the carbon sequestering features of marine organisms, this perspective proposes five action points. Foremost, MSY should be complemented with a new management objective: maximum carbon sequestration (MCS). Although many aspects of climate-based fisheries management remain to be explored, it appears clear that this would imply allowing stocks to recover to maintain a larger amount of biomass, increasing conservation measures for species particularly efficient in providing negative emissions, differentiation of fisheries within species as well as a new approach to ecosystem management. Climate reforming international fisheries law could make an important contribution to the operationalization of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals. As a first step, international guidelines should be developed on how to integrate the concept of maximum carbon sequestration in fisheries management.

TI  - Making the most of probabilistic marine forecasts on timescales of days, weeks and months ahead
AB  - Marine forecasts are essential to operational planning, with decisions able to be guided by a host of different weather products spanning a period of days, weeks and even months ahead. The correct selection and subsequent application of these different types of weather products has the potential to save many thousands of dollars per day in operational downtime, however this is only possible when the science underpinning these marine forecasts is properly understood by the user. In the current economic context, this is especially relevant to the offshore industry-whose use of forecasting technology is traditionally very conservative, and therefore whose planning is often more reactive -Allowing large savings (e.g. mobilization /demobilisation costs) if robust decisions are made as early as possible. Two established methods for the interpretation of probabilistic data based on cost-loss and weather regime analysis are described and applied to ocean wave forecasting. It is suggested the selection of methods will be dependant on the timescales of interest, with the cost-loss analysis optimised for supporting decisions at timescales on days to weeks ahead and the weather regime analysis optimized for supporting decisions at timescales of weeks to months ahead. The application of these methods are illustrated from the point of view of a North Sea asset manager planning the mobilization of equipment / personnel under conditions of calm weather, and the protection of equipment / personnel under conditions of severe weather. For such a user, efficient operational planning will be best supported by the use of marine forecasts across all such timescales, from days to months ahead. It is intended that this will enable more informed decision-making, and help reduce operational costs, by promoting increased confidence in longer-range forecasts than are typically used by the offshore oil & gas and marine renewable energy sector.

TI  - Biomimetic hydrophilic foam with micro/nano-scale porous hydrophobic surface for highly efficient solar-driven vapor generation
AB  - Solar-driven vapor generation by localized solar heating of a photothermal material is an environmentally friendly approach for seawater desalination and wastewater purification. In this work, inspired by the leaf transpiration in nature, we designed a novel bionic leaf to realize highly efficient solar vapor generation. The leaf-inspired three-dimensional (3D) material structure had a hydrophilic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) foam layer (equivalence to the mesophyll tissue layer in a leaf) with high porosity and low thermal conductivity, a photothermal polypyrrole (PPy) layer (equivalence to the chlorophyll layer in a leaf) coated on the PVA foam, and a micro/nano-scale porous hydrophobic surface layer (equivalence to the stomal layer in a leaf). The PVA network had microchannels for water transportation and reducing water evaporation enthalpy, the PPy layer absorbed and converted solar energy to heat water locally, and the hydrophobic porous surface layer enhanced the rate of vapor escape. The as-fabricated vapor generator based on the bionic-leaf structure achieved an impressive high evaporation rate of 3.09 kg m(-2) h ` under one sun irradiation (1 kW m(-2)). The prototype vapor generator desalinated and purified brine and seawater successfully under natural sunlight. Such solar vapor generator based on the biomimetic structure provides a potential low-cost and highly efficient water purification technology to help mitigate the global water crisis using sustainable energy.

TI  - Innovative drilling fluid technology conquered tough geomechanics offshore Mexico
AB  - The reservoir field highlighted in this paper is located Offshore Mexico in the southeast part of Campeche Bay and hidden below a troublesome, unstable formation that must be transacted before reaching the new production zone. During the exploration phase, this section experienced severe lost circulation and unstable conditions before reaching the final depth. Based on lessons learned, the team worked to develop a best-practices approach using geomechanics analysis and a novel fluid technology which enabled the operator to safely drill through this problematic intermediate section under high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) conditions. The methodology started with identifying the geomechanics challenges, implementing operational best practices, and finally, use of an innovative, low-invasion fluid technology, which creates a thin and impermeable shield at the wellbore wall, effectively sealing the fractures and preventing fracture propagation in the highly unstable formation of interspersed carbonates, shales, and sandstones. The strong mechanical properties of the thin, but firm, barrier created at the wellbore wall minimized the destabilizing effect of fluid invasion. Synergy from the geomechanical team, best practices for the operation, and innovative drilling fluid technology solved the wellbore instability drilling challenge encountered in the exploration well. In offset wells, losses of more than 2,200 m3 of drilling fluid, stuck pipe, and major NPT were observed. By incorporating the shielding technology, wellbore instability was improved in the intermediate section. In addition, the fluid technology was easily pumped through the bottomhole assembly (BHA) to seal formation fractures between 2,000 and 3,000 Î¼m in size. This well, utilizing the barrier technology to mitigate the wellbore instability and drill within a narrow fracture gradient operating window, was the first in the area to have zero loss of drilling fluid as compared to the typical 5 to 10-m3/hr circulation losses experienced during exploration drilling in the intermediate section characterized by interbedded layers of carbonates, shales, and sandstone under high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) conditions. The coordination between the teams using best practices was critical to meeting the challenge of the intermediate geomechanically weak formation. This case history in offshore Mexico will demonstrate both the importance of teamwork and the utilization of a proven technology that improves wellbore instability, minimizes NPT, mitigates pipe tripping issues and avoids huge volumes of drilling fluid lost into the geomechanically weak formation. This barrier technology can be applied globally to troublesome formations - such as interbedded carbonates, shales, and sandstones - to improve operations and provide cost savings for the operator.

TI  - Carbon stock estimation of seagrass species thalassia hempricii using planet imagery with band ratio transformation in nirwana beach, padang city
AB  - Coastal ecosystems such as seagrass beds can store large amounts of carbon over a relatively long period of time, so a special study is needed for the seagrass ecosystem. Nirwana Beach located in Padang City presents an overview of extensive seagrass ecosystem. The carbon stock is estimated by utilizing Planet imagery with spatial resolution 3m with band ratio transformation method. Band ratio used are band ratio Green / Blue, Green / Red, and Blue / Red. Data processing is done based on correlation analysis and regression analysis between band ratio pixel value on image with value of carbon stock in field. The results show that band ratio of Green / Red has the highest r2 indicating a strong correlation relationship.

TI  - Outcome of the Ocean Sequestration Project, and technical evaluation of CCS as mitigation measure of increase atmospheric CO2 and Ocean Acidification
AB  - IPCC AR4 reported that the emission of the anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide (CO2) increase the CO2 concentration in atmosphere after the Industrial Revolution, and increasing of CO2 concentration caused the global warming. Moreover, it is shown that CO2 dissolution into the ocean causes the acidification in the surface layer. The buffering effect of the ocean can suppress the change of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. However, the rise of the CO2 concentration in the ocean surface means the pH of seawater decreases. This phenomenon continues until the difference of CO2 partial pressure between the atmosphere and the ocean disappears if the emission of CO2 is stopped. But, the acidification of the ocean progresses as long as it keeps CO2 emission. It is feared that the ocean acidification has crises influence on various organisms and entire ocean ecosystem. Carbon Capture and Storage is one of the mitigation measure technologies of CO2 emission. Famous carbon storage technology of the CCS using ocean region is Sub-seabed Geological Storage and dilution type Ocean Sequestration. These CCS Technologies has been developed in RITE. Especially, Research and development project of ocean sequestration technology was established the core technologies for example CO2 injection and dilution technology, prediction of drop and diluted CO2 and evaluation methods of biological influence of CO 2. These core technologies were enabled a feasibility study of Ocean Sequestration technology as total system. These studies showed constructions of ocean sequestration system, and estimated sequestration costs and additional CO2 amount. Furthermore, in this evaluation, the ocean sequestration system without the influence on the marine organism was shown by scientists of the Ocean Sequestration Project of Japan. This evaluation and comparison study for atmospheric CO2 decreasing measure and ocean acidification mitigation measure was based on above results, and it was carried out using three dimensional numerical model with ocean circulation model (MOM: Modular Ocean Model), global carbon cycle model based on a lower trophic ecosystem model and one box atmospheric model. And the several scenarios were selected for evaluation of CCS efficiency. These scenarios ware targeted over CO2 emission based on S550 scenario and over emission were allocated to Geological Storage, Ocean Sequestration, other measure and no measure. Simulation results of Ocean Sequestration suggested efficiency for mitigation measure of increase atmospheric CO2 and Ocean Acidification. However, it was shown that the effect was different according to the ocean. Results of the simulation study showed "Geological storage without leakage is the best as the effect of measures". And it is suggested that "There is a possibility of suppressing the ocean surface acidification to more effective by combining dilution type ocean sequestration with subseabed geological storage". The effectiveness of ocean sequestration and geological storage was shown to some degree by this research. It is necessary to re-examine the use of the ocean model of a high resolution and the emission scenario of CO2, and to show the result with higher reliability. Â© 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The effect of resource quality on the growth of Holothuria scabra during aquaculture waste bioremediation
AB  - Reducing dependency on environmentally unsustainable formulated feeds, most of which include limited reserves of fishmeal as a protein source, is a priority for the aquaculture industry, particularly for intensive culture systems. One approach is to increase nitrogen reuse within the system by feeding nitrogen-rich aquaculture effluent to deposit feeders, thereby closing the aquaculture nitrogen-loop. This study, for the first time and on a laboratory-scale, has reared juveniles of the sea cucumber Holothuria scabra at high densities solely on particulate organic waste from a commercial-scale land-based abalone recirculating aquaculture system. Furthermore, growth rates and biomass yields were increased significantly by adjusting the effluent C:N from 5:1 to 20:1 by adding exogenous organic carbon sources (glucose, starch and cellulose), so fuelling accelerated heterotrophic bacterial production within the redox-stratified tank sediment. Sea cucumber juveniles reared solely on effluent had a biomass density of 711 gm(-2) after four months whereas animals reared on starch-amended effluent (the best performing treatment) had a final density of 1011 gm(-2). Further optimisation of this approach could increase biomass yields and pave the way for the commercial cultivation of deposit feeding animals on waste streams, thus contributing to more environmentally sustainable aquaculture. Here, the nitrogen that originated from fishmeal is not lost through the discharge of aquaculture effluent; rather, it is immobilised into single cell biomass that is up-cycled into high-value secondary biomass. We demonstrate that sea cucumbers can be produced at high density through the manipulation of the C:N ratio of aquaculture effluent.

TI  - CHOOSE YOUR LAWS CAREFULLY: EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY TO UNILATERALLY WITHDRAW THE UNITED STATES OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF FROM LEASING DISPOSITION
AB  - Congress enacted the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) to both exert federal jurisdiction over the submerged lands of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf and establish the legal framework for America's offshore energy production regime. Section 12(a) of OCSLA is a short yet potent provision that grants a president the authority to withdraw unleased offshore lands from leasing disposition, effectively banning any form of energy exploration or production. In recent decades, presidents have embraced section 12(a) not only to ban offshore energy production, but also to protect the marine environment itself. Presidents have also utilized a different federal law, the Antiquities Act of 1906 (Antiquities Act), to create marine national monuments, providing general protection for areas of rich biodiversity, scientific interest, and cultural heritage. Interestingly, both OCSLA and the Antiquities Act achieve the same end results: offshore energy production is prohibited and the marine environment is protected. The crucial distinction between the two laws, though, is the ability to provide permanent protection. A close study of these laws reveals that only one indeed provides the intended lasting protection that presidents have sought: the Antiquities Act. This Note probes the theory of executive authority to unilaterally remove America's submerged lands from leasing disposition.

TI  - Commissioning of a 0.8 MWth CFBC for oxy-fuel combustion
AB  - Oxy-fuel FBC technology is a new technology being developed for power production from carbonaceous fuels which also produces a near pure steam of CO2 ready for sequestration or storage. Unlike oxy-fuel pulverized fuel combustion technology, oxy-fuel FBC offers the possibility of using poor quality coals, hydrocarbon residues and a range of other materials including biomass. In western Canada, pitches, tars and bottoms in particular are available in large quantities, and this technology offers an opportunity to use many of these waste feedstocks in an environmentally benign manner. In addition, oxy-fuel CFBC can be fired at lower flue gas recycle ratio than its pulverized fuel equivalent, offering potentially smaller plants for any given power output. Finally, like air fired systems it also offers in situ sulphur capture. CanmetENERGY has operated a 50 kW oxy-fuel CFBC with full flue gas recycle since 2006. Initial results were very encouraging and to further study oxy-fuel FBC technology, a 0.8 MWth CFBC unit has also been retrofitted for oxy-fuel research. The facility is used to simulate commercial oxy-fuel CFBC performance and to do this it has been extensively modified, by adding an oxygen supply, flue gas recycle train, an air tight fly ash discharge system, a flue gas compressor for bag house pulsing and system purge, etc., as well as upgrading the control and instrumentation for oxy-firing. The most major challenge has been to properly seal the entire CFBC unit to prevent air ingress. Fuels fired during the commissioning phase included bituminous coal from the US, petroleum coke, and lignite from Canada. Combustion under oxy-fuel conditions has proved to be very stable and the transitions from air to the oxy-fuel firing mode and the reverse transition are rapid and present little or no operational difficulties. This work has also demonstrated that the retrofitted oxy-fuel CFBC produces a stream of flue gas containing 80-90\% of CO2, while NOx emissions have been shown to be significantly lower compared to air firing when operating with the same fuel. Finally, SO2 capture was in the range of 70-75\%, but the limestone utilization is lower than in air-firing mode, and research is on-going to better understand sulphation performance under oxy-firing conditions.

TI  - Sustainable desalination device capable of producing freshwater and electricity
AB  - Freshwater shortage and the growing demand for electricity are the most common issues on the path toward achieving global sustainability. Therefore, finding creative solutions involving the use of renewable energy sources presents the main challenge. Herein, we developed a cost-effective and highly efficient 2-in-1 integrated conical device consisting of multi-walled carbon nanotubes deposited filter paper, and iron wire, capable of simultaneously generating not only freshwater but also electricity from seawater. The 3D multi-walled carbon nanotubes/paper conical structure is an interconnecting link between steam and electricity generation, providing spacious surface area for both interfacial evaporation and oxygen reduction reaction (as a cathode of metal-air battery). The use of multi-walled carbon nanotubes not only secure high broadband light absorptance (~97% in UVâ€“Vis-NIR) but also its conductivity is vital for efficient electricity generation. The device is capable of generating a power density of 13.50 WÂ·mâˆ’2 while maintaining an evaporation rate of 1.53 kgÂ·m-2Â·hâˆ’1 under 1 kWÂ·mâˆ’2 solar illumination. In the current implementation, the energy density and built-in characteristics of the device, along with desalination capabilities can be a modest but invaluable solution for freshwater and energy needs in off-grid areas.

TI  - Reduced water motion enhances organic carbon stocks in temperate eelgrass meadows
AB  - Organic carbon (OC) storage in coastal vegetated ecosystems is increasingly being considered in carbon financing and climate change mitigation strategies. However, spatial heterogeneity in these ``blue carbon{''} stocks among and within habitats has only recently been examined, despite its considerable implications. Seagrass meadows have potential to store significant amounts of carbon in their sediments, yet studies comparing sediment OC content at regional and meadow scales remain sparse. Here, we collected sediment cores from six temperate eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows on the coast of British Columbia, Canada, to quantify sediment OC stocks, accumulation rates, and sources, and to examine local and regional drivers of variability. Sediment OC content was highly variable-across all sites, stocks in the top 0-5 cm ranged from 83 to 1089 g OC m(-2), while the 15-20 cm stocks exhibited a 24-fold difference, from 59 to 1407 g OC m(-2). Carbon accumulation rates ranged from 4 to 33 g OC m(-2) yr(-1). Isotopic mixing models revealed that sediment OC was primarily terrestrial carbon (41.3\%) and canopy-forming kelps (33.3\%), with a smaller contribution of eelgrass (25.3\%). Here, we show that regional variability in OC content exceeds meadow-scale variability. This result is likely driven by landscape factors, most notably relative water motion, representing a more dominant control on seagrass OC accumulation than meadow-scale factors such as canopy complexity. These findings elicit caution when scaling up seagrass meadow OC content and demonstrate that measures of the hydrodynamic environment could improve estimates of carbon storage in temperate soft sediment habitats.

TI  - Lessons from the ROAD project for future deployment of CCS
AB  - The ROAD project was designed to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of a large-scale, integrated CCS-chain deployed on power generation. Post-combustion technology was to be applied to separate CO2 from the flue gases of the new 1069 MWe coal-fired Maasvlakte Power Plant 3 (MPP3) in the harbour area of Rotterdam. From the capture unit, the CO2 was to be compressed and transported through a pipeline, originally to the P18-A platform in the North Sea to inject CO2 in the P18-4 gas reservoir. An alternative storage site, the nearshore Q16-Maas, was selected in 2015. Feasibility and FEED studies were performed in the period from 2010 to 2017, when the industrial partners pulled out of the project because of lack of political and financial support for the ROAD project. Capture, transport and storage technology is available and will work; remaining questions can be answered by engineering solutions. The full-scale capture plant can be designed and procured to the standard required to enable FID. Pilot plants have proved very valuable for testing and improving the ROAD capture plant design. In all cases, safe and practical designs to transport and store the CO2 were developed. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Techno-economic analysis of combined concentrating solar power and desalination plant configurations in Israel and Jordan
AB  - Combined concentrating solar power (CSP) and desalination plants represent a realistic future option for the production of electricity and fresh water for countries of the world's sunbelt. In this paper, parabolic trough power plants for electricity production have been analysed in combination with multi-effect distillation (MED) and ultrafiltration/reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plants for two sites in Israel (Ashdod) and Jordan (Aqaba). Both RO and MED desalination plants were designed for a fresh water production capacity of 24,000 m(3)/d. The power block of the CSP plant was selected to meet the steam consumption of the MED plant at the design point, which led to a gross electrical power generation capacity of the power block of 42 MWel,gross. Due to the low availability and generally high cost of coastal land, the CSP + RO plant consists of two separate units. It was assumed that the CSP plant is located at an inland location where there is land available. The RO plant is located at the sea, while the MED plant is located at the CSP site. The pumping of the seawater and the water transmission system add about 0.2 \$/m(3) to the levelized water costs of the CSP + MED plant compared with a plant located at the sea. Three different sizes of high temperature heat storages (0h, 6h and 12h of additional full load operation of the steam turbine) were applied to find the most economic setup. At current prices for heat storage units, systems with huge heat storage capacities become economic only at high feed-in tariffs for electricity and thus high revenues. The price of the electricity generated by the CSP plant was varied to show the influence of the feed-in tariff on the water generating costs. The levelized costs of water (LCOW) strongly depend on the electricity price. Water costs in Ashdod are higher than those in Aqaba due to the lower solar irradiance. For Aqaba, LCOW of about 1 \$/m(3) can be realized if a feed-in tariff of about 0.24 \$/kWh for electricity from renewable energy sources is established.

TI  - A complementary safety tool for Blowout Preventers
AB  - Hydrocarbon exploration and production relies on Blowout Preventers (BOPs) to prevent catastrophic accidents; however, currently there are no in-situ or rapidly deployable backup systems for BOPs. This paper presents a method and machine for predictably stemming an uncontrolled flow resulting from a failed Blowout Preventer. The tool, referred to as the "Hampering Active Wellbore Kit" (HAWK), is a machine that can feed wire (with varying material properties along its length) through a BOP's existing ports and into the wellbore. The wire, initially stored in spools inside the device, forms a tangled wire mass (TWM) inside the wellbore that serves to gradually stem the uncontrolled flow. A design theory is described for wire feeding in order to form a TWM in a free flowing conduit, and the efficacy of the method is evaluated by comparing flow rates of a single wellbore before and after the introduction of the TWM. A prototype machine for direct attachment to a BOP as a backup safety system is presented based on operating constraints and industry requirements. Copyright 2016, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Managing constant bottom hole pressure with continuous flow systems
AB  - Managing downhole pressure and temperature is critical, particularly in deepwater, high-pressure, high-temperature (HP/HT), extended reach drilling (ERD), and other challenging operating conditions. A large percentage of all drilling hazards related to wellbore pressure occur when mud pumps are cycled off and on during connections, causing fluctuations in equivalent circulation densities (ECD) and downhole pressure and temperature spikes. These conditions can result in expensive downtime, safety issues, and the inability to drill a well within extreme scenarios. Continuous flow system (CFS) technology mitigates the hazards of wellbore pressure drilling even while mud pumps are cycled off and on during connections. Unregulated, these cycles can cause ECD fluctuations and downhole pressure spikes. The system ensures constant bottomhole pressure. This variant of Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) can reduce expensive downtime, minimize safety issues, and enable safe and efficient drilling in otherwise undrillable wells. This technology can enable the drilling team to decrease nonproductive time by providing continuous circulation, which improves hole cleaning and maintains ECD. Test results of the use of a continuous flow system under development reveal that the system can maintain bottomhole pressure constant consistently and continuously.

TI  - The effects of fuel type and cathode off-gas recirculation on combined heat and power generation of marine SOFC systems
AB  - An increasing demand in the marine industry to reduce emissions led to investigations into more efficient power conversion using fuels with sustainable production pathways. Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) are under consideration for long-range shipping, because of its high efficiency, low pollutant emissions, and fuel flexibility. SOFC systems also have great potential to cater for the heat demand in ships, but the heat integration is not often considered when assessing its feasibility. This study evaluates the electrical and heat efficiency of a 100 kW SOFC system for marine applications fuelled with methane, methanol, diesel, ammonia, or hydrogen. In addition, cathode off-gas recirculation (COGR) is investigated to tackle low oxygen utilisation and thus improve heat regeneration. The software Cycle Tempo is used to simulate the power plant, which uses a 1D model for the SOFCs. At nominal conditions, the highest net electrical efficiency (LHV) was found for methane (58.1%), followed by diesel (57.6%), and ammonia (55.1%). The highest heat efficiency was found for ammonia (27.4%), followed by hydrogen (25.6%). COGR resulted in similar electrical efficiencies, but increased the heat efficiency by 11.9% to 105.0% for the different fuels. The model was verified with a sensitivity analysis and validated by comparison with similar studies. It is concluded that COGR is a promising method to increase the heat efficiency of marine SOFC systems. Â© 2022 The Author(s)

TI  - Prospects for carbon-neutral maritime fuels production in Brazil
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has compromised to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the mid- and long-terms. Besides energy efficiency measures, the development of potentially carbon neutral fuels in the upcoming years is key to achieve the sector's goals. Brazil is a major commodity exporter whose unfavored geographical position increases the carbon intensity of its maritime transportation. In this context, this study presents a multicriteria methodology to compare possible alternative fuels for the Brazilian maritime trade. To this end, 14 fuel options are evaluated according to technical, economic, and environmental criteria to which different weights are assigned. The ranking of results indicates that drop-in fuels such as Fischer-Tropsch diesel, alcohol-based diesel, straight and hydrotreated vegetable oils and e-diesel stand out as promising mid-term alternatives. Biomass-based liquefied natural gas (Bio-LNG) performance in the evaluation is hampered mostly by the risk of methane slip. Green hydrogen and green ammonia, on the other hand, seem to be less competitive alternatives in the mid-term horizon for Brazil but may become alternatives for cabotage transport in the longterm.

TI  - Microalgal Biomass: A Biorefinery Approach
AB  - The biorefinery concept has been identified as the most promising way to create a biomass-based industry, which can be defined as the sustainable biomass processing to obtain energy biofuels and high-value products through processes and equipment for biomass. Microalgae can be used as an efficient and economically viable biorefinery feedstock; microalgae could be used in different areas such as human and animal nutrition, nutraceutical and therapeutic products, fertilizers, plastics, isoprenes and biofuels and also in the treatment of wastewaters and CO2 capture. Microalgae biomass can be used for biofuel production, such as bioelectricity, methane, biohydrogen, bioethanol and biodiesel. In this chapter, an overview of the factors that affect the production of the microalgal biomass yield and value-added by-products production is presented. Likewise, we present the results of the microalgal culture of Scenedesmus sp. SCX2 performed in semicontinuous culture (SCC), in 2000 raceway ponds employing Bold's Basal Medium (BBM), under greenhouse conditions. Over the SCC, we monitored biomass concentration, lipid, protein, pigments and sugar production, light irradiance, culture and greenhouse temperature and nitrate concentration in the medium.

TI  - Indonesia deepwater field development technical, contracting, and execution challenges
AB  - The Oil and gas industry has gone through major transformation over the last six years from relatively quiet to extremely dynamic market conditions. The dynamic market condition has introduced new challenges for Operators in terms of field development cost estimates, biding strategy and cycles, project schedule, execution, shortage of equipment, material, and personnel. The same market conditions have also created challenges for contractors in coping with volume of the work and staff turnover. Determination of the best concept for a deepwater field is not always a clear and an easy task. The final development recommendation is often strongly influenced by non-technical considerations such as the market conditions, maximization of local content, and transfer of technology. Offshore East Kalimantan, Kutai basin in Makassar Strait is a major oil and gas region. The conditions in the area are unique, offering opportunities and challenges in development of new fields. The water depth in the deep section of the basin extends to approximately 1900m. The environmental conditions in the area are benign with exception of strong persistent currents.

TI  - Combined optical and acoustic monitoring of fishes in the demonstration site of marine renewable energy development
AB  - Before the installation of marine renewable energy devices, fish species and abundance should be examined for selecting the proper site where the effects of the devices on the environment and fish will be as small as possible. Fish species and abundance can be examined in a variety of methods such as a fish finder using an acoustic wave and fishing gears such as a gill net. However, the fish finder cannot specify the species of fish that is sometimes estimated from the experience of fishermen or scientific researchers. Some amounts of fish must be removed from the target sea area in case of using the fishing gear, while the species of fish can be specified. In the present study, an underwater optical video camera is combined with the fish finder using an acoustic wave to specify the species of fish. A circular fish-eye digital video camera is inserted into a waterproof container. A part of the container is made of glass in a dome shape for the circular fish-eye lens. The container is attached to polyethylene ropes and is towed by a fishing vessel. First, the hydrodynamic characteristics of the container was examined by a towing test with the three kinds of towing speed in a water tank. Then the container was towed in the real sea, which is the demonstration site of offshore wind and wave energy developments off Kamaishi of Iwate Prefecture. The depth of the video camera with the container was not constant since the moving speed of the fishing vessel was slow and fluctuating. The image of video camera could be captured successfully together with that of the acoustic video camera, while fish could not be found in both the optical and acoustic measurements in the present investigation. The investigation will be continued, and the effects of transparency of water should be discussed as future works. Also the actual or model fish should be captured by the underwater video camera to evaluate if it can specify the species of fish. Â© Copyright 2016 by ASME.

TI  - Determination of the amount of carbon stored in a disturbed mangrove forest in Campeche, Mexico
AB  - Carbon sequestration potential of mangrove forest in Campeche, Mexico, was investigated. Field work was conducted at two sites at the border of the estuary named ``Terminos Lagoon{''} (Estero-Pargo and Bahamitas) between February and August in 2009. The mangrove forest in both sites has been subjected to anthropogenic pollution during the last years and it can be considered as perturbed. Six sampling campaigns were performed considering three climatic periods ({''}Norths{''} season, dry season and rainy season). Seasonal influence on carbon storage was evident, but also the influence of tides was significant, with the highest carbon storage during ``Norths{''} and dry seasons (ranged from 10.63 to 37.64 Kg C m(-2) for Estero-Pargo, and from 12.8 to 39.9 Kg C m(-2) for Bahamitas). Carbon storage was higher in flooded soils with dominant vegetation of red mangrove in comparison with sampling zones where dominant vegetation was button mangrove. Organic matter and organic carbon content were higher at 30 cm depth during ``Norths{''} season, when heavy rains and long periods of tidal flooding occurred with low rates of litter export that maintained anoxic conditions. Comparing these results with carbon storage data obtained in other sites, it can be suggested that neutral and sandy soils as this study area and associations of red mangrove have a good potential of carbon sequestration. Since studied mangrove individuals were from young to mature in reproductive age, it can be conclude that this potential will increase in the next years.

TI  - Lessons of climate change, stories of solutions. The Netherlands: Innovative technology
AB  - While there is little dissent in the scientific community that climate change directly correlates to human-caused greenhouse-gas emissions, action to reduce those emissions has not followed from the United States and many other governments around the world. Meanwhile, climate changes are already underway, and will continue to some degree even if emissions are drastically curtailed, thanks to emissions already in the atmosphere. Some countries and states are making their own plans to adapt to expected impacts including higher sea levels, more intense rainfall, droughts, heat waves, and loss of water supplies-and to reduce their local emissions. In this Global Forum, three experts highlight efforts by national and local governments in planning for 2100 and beyond.

TI  - CARBON-USE STRATEGIES IN MACROALGAE: DIFFERENTIAL RESPONSES TO LOWERED PH AND IMPLICATIONS FOR OCEAN ACIDIFICATION
AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) is a reduction in oceanic pH due to increased absorption of anthropogenically produced CO2. This change alters the seawater concentrations of inorganic carbon species that are utilized by macroalgae for photosynthesis and calcification: CO2 and HCO3- increase; CO32- decreases. Two common methods of experimentally reducing seawater pH differentially alter other aspects of carbonate chemistry: the addition of CO2 gas mimics changes predicted due to OA, while the addition of HCl results in a comparatively lower {[}HCO3-]. We measured the short-term photosynthetic responses of five macroalgal species with various carbon-use strategies in one of three seawater pH treatments: pH 7.5 lowered by bubbling CO2 gas, pH 7.5 lowered by HCl, and ambient pH 7.9. There was no difference in photosynthetic rates between the CO2, HCl, or pH 7.9 treatments for any of the species examined. However, the ability of macroalgae to raise the pH of the surrounding seawater through carbon uptake was greatest in the pH 7.5 treatments. Modeling of pH change due to carbon assimilation indicated that macroalgal species that could utilize HCO3- increased their use of CO2 in the pH 7.5 treatments compared to pH 7.9 treatments. Species only capable of using CO2 did so exclusively in all treatments. Although CO2 is not likely to be limiting for photosynthesis for the macroalgal species examined, the diffusive uptake of CO2 is less energetically expensive than active HCO3- uptake, and so HCO3--using macroalgae may benefit in future seawater with elevated CO2.

TI  - Mangrove carbon assessment tool: Model validation and assessment of mangroves in southern USA and Mexico
AB  - While mangroves are widely recognized as a significant carbon (C) reservoir and the valued ecosystem services are inextricably linked to the C stocks and fluxes. Modeling tools haven't been available to simulate C dynamics in mangroves to inform assessments, Monitoring, Reporting and Verification for REDD+, or management and restoration prescriptions. The process-based model MCAT-DNDC (Mangrove-Carbon-Assessment-Tool-DeNitrification-DeComposition) was validated using measurements from sites in Quintana Roo, Mexico and Florida, USA. The validated model was then applied to model C sequestration in mangroves sites in Texas, Louisiana and Florida that had measured data for comparison. The model validation against aboveground biomass (AGB) showed that the simulation provided good agreement with observations with a proper slope (1.06) and small intercept (1.32 Mg haâˆ’1, about 1.4% of observed mean); the model performance efficiency for assessing AGB was high (R2 = 0.99). Among ten C pools and fluxes validated using data from the Everglades National Park, eight components were in good agreement with the observations, and two were within the range of observation; demonstrating effective model performance (R2 &gt; 0.95). The metrics from the model validation showed that MCAT-DNDC can be used to estimate C sequestration in mangroves within the coastal areas along Gulf of Mexico and Mexican Caribbean with good model performance. Simulated C dynamics for plots in Texas, Louisiana and Florida showed that the relationship between above-ground biomass and stand age was non-linear, and that gross and net primary productivity increased logarithmically with stand age. The differences in C components among the sites exhibited the effects of ecological drivers on C sequestration in mangroves. Simulations also demonstrated that the model may be useful in considering the effect of forest management on C sequestration. The model appears to be stable and sufficiently robust to warrant further testing with additional data and across a variety of sites. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Field scale evaluation of seaweed aquaculture as a nutrient bioextraction strategy in Long Island Sound and the Bronx River Estuary
AB  - Nutrient bioextraction using Gracilaria tikvahiae McLachlan was tested at two sites: one off Fairfield, CT (LIS), and the other at the mouth of the Bronx River Estuary (BRE), during the summer and fall of 2011 and 2012. The estimates of nitrogen (N) removal by Gracilaria over a 90-day growing season were up to 28 and 94kgNha-1 at the LIS and BRE sites, respectively. In July 2012, Gracilaria grew up to 16.5%day-1 at BRE and 4.8%day-1 at the LIS site. Tissue N contents at the same periods were 3.7% (BRE) and 1.5% (LIS), respectively. These results demonstrate rapid assimilation of nutrients fueling the growth of new Gracilaria tissue at the BRE site, while nutrients appeared to limit growth at the LIS site during the summer months. The estimated C removal by Gracilaria at the BRE and LIS sites were up to 300kgha-1 (LIS) and 727kgha-1 (BRE), respectively. The potential economic values of N and C sequestration for the period examined in this study were as high as $311 (LIS) and $940ha-1 (BRE) for N, and $5.51 (LIS) and $13.32ha-1 (BRE) for C if seaweed aquaculture would be included in Connecticut's Nitrogen Trading Program. This represents a potential additional economic incentive for seaweed growers, beyond the direct value of seaweed products. The findings in this study showed that seaweed (Gracilaria) aquaculture can be a useful technique for nutrient bioextraction in urbanized coastal waters, such as the estuaries of New York City (BRE) and Long Island Sound.

TI  - Optimization-Based Power and Energy Management System in Shipboard Microgrid: A Review
AB  - The increasing demands for reducing greenhouse emissions and improving fuel efficiency of marine transportation have presented opportunities for electric ships. Due to the complexity of multiple power resources coordination, varied propulsion loads, changeable economical, and environmental requirements, power/energy management system (PMS/EMS) becomes essential in both designing and operational processes. The existing literature on PMS/EMS can be categorized into rule-based and optimization-based approaches. Compared to the rule-based PMS/EMS, which relies heavily on human expertise, as well as predefined strategies and priorities, the optimization-based approaches can offer more efficient solutions and are more widely used nowadays. This article provides a comprehensive review of the marine optimization-based power/energy management system and discusses the future trends of PMS/EMS in ship power systems.

TI  - Japan is moving forward to large-scale CCS demonstrations
AB  - Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is a key technology to reduce carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere. The Japanese government has been accelerating development of CCS. Japan CCS Co Ltd. (JCCS) was established to support the government by Japanese private sectors. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) subsidized and commissioned the company to carry out comprehensive investigations for large-scale demonstrations in Japan. In the first year for JCCS, META subsidized the company to carry out a site screening and feasibility studies at several selected candidate sites. In 2009, METI commissioned the company to carry out a 3D seismic survey at the Tomakomai candidate site and an offshore pipeline route survey at the Iwaki-oki candidate site.

TI  - An investigation into making ships cleaner and more energy efficient
AB  - "Naval-fx" consists of the development of a novel device (diffuser-receiver) with memory effect connected to the Internet and ready on board the ship which allows through the use of the already know quantum theory the molecular reorganization of the matter applied to marine fuels. The principles of quantum physics studied and interpreted and applied in the right way allow the establishment of an algorithmic relationship between the magnetic field information of the material (in this case the fuel) to be treated and a series of sound frequencies that are emitted from a server. It allows the aforementioned molecular reorganization of the treated matter and thereby a reduction in the emissions on board CO, CO2, NOx and SOx among other advantages such as noise and vibrations reduction or longer engine life. This process has been called "Dynamization". The main effect (based on molecular reorganization) is based on returning to atoms and molecules their original properties (before extraction, transport, refinement, etc.) through activation as explained above of their Magnetic field information. The phenomenon of activation of the system realized through computer algorithms will allow to instantly alter the magnetic information field of an atom and molecule or particle set at any distance without any loss of power made which surpasses all the electromagnetic and chemical systems employed today.

TI  - Passive acoustic monitoring of seabed gas seeps - Application of beamforming techniques
AB  - Passive acoustics has been identified as an important strategy to determine underwater gas flux at natural sites, or at locations related to anthropogenic activities. The ability of an acoustic system to detect, quantify and locate a gas leak is fundamentally controlled by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the bubble sounds relative to the background noise. To demonstrate the effectiveness of array processing for passive monitoring of gas seeps, this work considers the use of beamforming methods to enhance the SNR and so improve the performance of passive acoustic systems. To achieve high levels of noise reduction an adaptive bubble focused broadband beamformer is employed, specifically the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer. The technique is demonstrated using an array of five hydrophones collecting data at the controlled CO2 gas release experiment conducted as part of STEMM-CCS (Strategies for Environmental Monitoring of Marine Carbon Capture and Storage) project.

TI  - Detritus dynamics in the seagrass Posidonia oceanica: Elements for an ecosystem carbon and nutrient budget
AB  - Leaf decay, leaf litter export, burial in belowground sinks, and respiratory consumption of detritus were examined at 2 different depths in a Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile meadow off the Medes Islands, NW Mediterranean. At 5 m, the amount el exported leaf litter represented carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus losses of 7, 9 and 6% of the plant primary production, respectively. About 26% of the carbon produced by the plant in 1 yr was immobilized by burial in the belowground compartment, i.e. as roots and rhizomes. Annual nitrogen and phosphorus burial in the sediment was 8 and 5% of total N and P needs, respectively. Respiratory consumption (aerobic) of carbon leaf detritus represented 17% of the annual production. An additional, but very substantial, loss of carbon as very fine particulate organic matter has been estimated at ca 48%. At 13 m the pattern of carbon losses was similar, but the lesser effect of wave action (relative to that at 5 m) reduced exportation, hence increasing the role of respiratory consumption. Data on carbon losses indicated that only a small part of the plant production was actually available to fuel the food web of this ecosystem. Total nutrient losses were in the range of 21 to 47% of annual needs. From differences found in N and P concentrations between living and dead tissues, it is suggested that important nutrient recycling (50 to 70%) may be due either to reclamation or to leaching immediately after plant death.

TI  - Environmental impacts of brass mesh nets on open ocean aquaculture pens in tropical marine environments
AB  - Aquaculture pens with brass mesh were installed at commercial fish farms in two locations, Panama and Mexico. Measurements of copper and zinc levels in the water and sediments were monitored over 468 and 435 days for the Panama and Mexico sites respectively. Additional chemical parameters were also measured including dissolved organic carbon in the water column and total solids, total organic carbon, total sulfides, redox potential and acid volatile sulfides and simultaneously extracted metals in the sediments. Measurements were taken at a reference site 1000 m away from the pens perpendicular to the dominant current direction, as well as 50 m upstream, 50 m downstream and adjacent to the pens. Muscle, skin and liver samples were taken from cobia (Rachycentron canadum) produced at the Panama site and analyzed for copper content. The dissolved copper levels at both farms stayed below 1 mu g/L at all times. There was no significant difference in the dissolved copper levels between the reference site and other measurement sites at either location. There was also no observable increase in dissolved copper levels over time at the Mexico location although there was a significant difference in dissolved copper levels between the sampling days at the Panama location. Zinc concentrations also remained within safe levels, never exceeding 0.82 mu g/L at any point. Copper and zinc levels in the sediments did not show a significant increase over time. The copper levels in tissue samples from the muscle tissue of the cobia raised in a brass mesh pen at the Panama site were 19\% higher than those raised in the plastic mesh pen. The elevated copper levels are well below recommended daily intake levels and do not pose a risk to human health. There was no significant difference in copper levels of the skin or liver tissue samples. The absence of any increase in liver copper levels suggests that the fish's physiology and welfare are not impacted by brass mesh. The findings suggest that brass mesh is environmentally compatible with high energy marine environments and a commercially viable product for open ocean aquaculture farms.

TI  - Submerged membrane coagulation hybrid system as pretreatment to organic matter removal from seawater
AB  - In this study, a commonly used ferric chloride was utilised as coagulant for removing organic compounds from seawater. More than 57% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was removed at optimum dosage of 3 mg Fe+3/L. The coagulation by FeCl3 at optimum dosage could remove a majority (95%) of hydrophobic compounds. The results from Liquid Chromatography - Organic Carbon Detector showed that only &lt;0.02 mg/L of hydrophobic compounds was found after coagulation. In addition, the modified fouling index decreased considerably from 15,848 s/L2 with raw seawater to 3,025 s/L 2 with seawater after coagulation. In-line coagulation coupled with submerged membrane system (ICSMS) was also trialled. It is observed that critical flux was increased from 20 L/m2Â·h in the conventional submerged membrane system to 55 L/m2 h in ICSMS. The ICSMS could remain the high DOC removal efficiency (more than 70%) at filtration rate of 20 L/m2 h when keeping the development of trans-membrane pressure was significant lower than that of conventional submerged membrane system.

TI  - Traffic analysis and modelling of long range Wi-Fi based marine communication network
AB  - Current technology assistance to Indian Fishermen for coastal communication consists mainly of handheld radios, which only enables broadcast communication over a short range. In order to overcome these limitations, a cost effective marine communication infrastructure based on long range Wi-Fi backhaul, called OceanNet, has been developed at our research centre, where fishermen would be able to have Internet access until 60 km. This work aims to carry out traffic analysis and modelling of this marine communication network for Fishermen, OceanNet. This exercise will help us model and understand the behavior of the network, once it is scaled up when the OceanNet deployment is done on several boats and the number of end user devices (smart phones and tablets) increases. It will also help us to identify bottlenecks in the network and identify ways to overcome these bottlenecks. This work is based on real world traffic data collected from the field trials conducted over the Arabian Sea and an experimental network set up over the backwaters. Â© 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Simulated CO2-induced ocean acidification for ocean in the East China: historical conditions since preindustrial time and future scenarios
AB  - Since preindustrial times, as atmospheric CO2 concentration increases, the ocean continuously absorbs anthropogenic CO2, reducing seawater pH and {[}CO32-], which is termed ocean acidification. We perform Earth system model simulations to assess CO2-induced acidification for ocean in the East China, one of the most vulnerable areas to ocean acidification. By year 2017, ocean surface pH in the East China drops from the preindustrial level of 8.20 to 8.06, corresponding to a 35\% rise in {[}H+], and reduction rate of pH becomes faster in the last two decades. Changes in surface seawater acidity largely result from CO2-induced changes in surface dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), alkalinity (ALK), salinity and temperature, among which DIC plays the most important role. By year 2300, simulated reduction in sea surface [}CO32-] is 13\% under RCP2.6, contrasted to 72\% under RCP8.5. Furthermore, simulated results show that CO2-induced warming acts to mitigate reductions in {[}CO32-], but the individual effect of oceanic CO2 uptake is much greater than the effect of CO2-induced warming on ocean acidification. Our study quantifies ocean acidification induced by anthropogenic CO2, and indicates the potentially important role of accelerated CO2 emissions in projections of future changes in biogeochemistry and ecosystem of ocean in the East China.

TI  - Pushing conventional boundaries of hydrate management in a dry tree facility
AB  - In the oil and gas production industry, it is well known that formation of hydrate blockages can cause substantial economic impact in terms of deferred production and the costs of remediation. Considering these financial implications and to avoid any potential safety concerns during a hydrate remediation, most often operating companies design and operate fields on a hydrate management philosophy of complete avoidance of hydrate formation. In the last few years, however, a shift in the hydrate management philosophy is being observed as discussed in the publications of Creek et al., 2011 and Kinnari et al., 2015, to cite a few. Due to the developments shifting towards more extreme environments, hydrate management philosophy is shifting from complete avoidance to risk management. This paper discusses the evolution of hydrate management philosophy of a dry tree facility in the Gulf of Mexico. During steady state production, the fluids flow at temperatures outside the hydrate envelope. The hydrate management strategy following a shutdown is to displace (bullhead) the riser tubing with dead oil within the cooldown time (time required for the fluids to enter hydrate forming conditions after a shutdown). However, due to the dry tree configuration, low liquid rates and insulation performance, the cooldown time is short for these high water cut wells. Using gas lift to boost production further decreases the predicted cooldown time to less than an hour making it operationally difficult to complete hydrate safe out measures within the design cooldown time. A few tests conducted in the field to identify a realistic time available after shutdown, along with a few historical instances during which the hydrate safe out measures could not be completed within the cooldown time, have indicated that there exists a range of water cut (WC) and GOR (Gas to oil ratio) within which the system was restarted without a hydrate blockage. This paper describes how a combination of industry standard predictive tools coupled with field observations is shaping the hydrate management philosophy of this field, by operating within conditions that can form hydrates but do not lead to blockage. The paper also describes two hydrate blockage instances that occurred when the operating conditions were outside the identified hydrate blockage limit reinforcing that the WC and GOR of the fluids have a strong influence on the hydrate blockage risk.

TI  - Performance analysis of an Integrated Solar Combined Cycle using Direct Steam Generation in parabolic trough collectors
AB  - The contribution of solar thermal power to improve the performance of gas-fired combined cycles in very hot and dry environmental conditions is analyzed in this work, in order to assess the potential of this technique, and to feature Direct Steam Generation (DSG) as a well suited candidate for achieving very good results in this quest. The particular Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) power plant proposed consists of a DSG parabolic trough field coupled to the bottoming steam cycle of a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power plant. For this analysis, the solar thermal power plant performs in a solar dispatching mode: the gas turbine always operates at full load, only depending on ambient conditions, whereas the steam turbine is somewhat boosted to accommodate the thermal hybridization from the solar field.Although the analysis is aimed to studying such complementary effects in the widest perspective, two relevant examples are given, corresponding to two well-known sites: AlmerÃ­a (Spain), with a mediterranean climate, and Las Vegas (USA), with a hot and dry climate. The annual simulations show that, although the conventional CCGT power plant works worse in Las Vegas, owing to the higher temperatures, the ISCC system operates better in Las Vegas than in AlmerÃ­a, because of solar hybridization is especially well coupled to the CCGT power plant in the frequent days with great solar radiation and high temperatures in Las Vegas. The complementary effect will be clearly seen in these cases, because the thermal power provided by the solar field compensates the gas turbine part load performance due to the high temperatures. The economical analysis points out that this hybrid scheme is a cheaper way to exploit concentrated solar energy, although it is limited to a small fraction of the combined cycle power. The analysis also shows that the marginal cost of solar electricity is strongly influenced by the goodness of coupling, so this cost is lower in Las Vegas than in AlmerÃ­a. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Energy sources
AB  - Primary sources of energy are fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, coal, and other sources such as nuclear, solar, wind, hydroelectricity, or potential sources available in oceans. It is estimated that there is 57 ZJ of oil reserves on Earth. This amount includes the available but not necessarily recoverable reserves. Energy of ocean can be categorized in three major methods; ocean wave power, ocean tidal power, and ocean thermal power. All of these three methods can be installed as on-shore or offshore applications. Geothermal energy is the utilization of heat stored in the inner layers of the earth or collecting the absorbed heat derived from underground. Biomass is a fuel that is also called biofuel, and the bio-energy is the energy enclosed in the biomass. Today, biomass has a small contribution to the overall energy supply, although it was the major fuel till the nineteenth century. Electric energy generation is a process where the energy sources or energy potential is converted to electrical energy. Energy generation can be done in various techniques. Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Integrated Control Strategy Supporting the Optimal Management of a 3-kW Vanadium Redox Flow Battery: a Case Study for an Islanded DC Microgrid
AB  - This paper presents an integrated control strategy for the decarbonization of an islanded DC microgrid including one micro gas turbines (MGT), an organic photovoltaic system, a wave energy converter and a vanadium redox flow battery in the service of the upstream auxiliary loads of an off-shore oil rig. An optimized energy management system is proposed to control the microgrid power flow with the objective of minimizing the CO2 emission from the supporting MGT while exploiting the flexibility of control of the specific storage technology to achieve high efficiency and large energy capacity. The novelty relies on a mixed use of techniques, some of which typical of energy system planning and other of primary controls, because currently the grid under study only operates on 2 MGTs and we had to provide the comprehensive solution to verify how to decarbonize such services for the near future, along with its economics.

TI  - Challenges and Opportunities of Big Data Analytics for Upcoming Regulations and Future Transformation of the Shipping Industry
AB  - Shipping is a heavily regulated industry and responsible for around 3\% of global carbon emissions. Global trade is highly dependent on shipping which covers around 90\% of commercial demand. Now the industry is expected to navigate through many twists and turns of different situations like upcoming regulations, climate change, energy shortages and technological revolutions. Technological development is apparent across all marine sectors due to the rapid development of sensor technology, IT, automation and robotics. The industry must continue to develop at a rapid pace over the next decade in order to be able to adapt to upcoming regulations and market pressure. Ship intelligence will be the driving force shaping the future of the industry. Ships generate a large volume of data from different sources and in different formats. So big data has become the talk of the industry nowadays. Big data analysis discovers correlations between different measurable or unmeasurable parameters to determine hidden patterns and trends. This analysis will have a significant impact on vessel performance monitoring and provide performance prediction, real-time transparency, and decision-making support to the ship operator. Big data will also bring new opportunities and challenges for the maritime industry. It will increase the capability of performance monitoring, remove human error and increase interdependencies of components. However, the industry will have to face many challenges such as data processing, reliability, and data security. Many regulations rely on ship data including the new EU MRV (Monitoring, Reporting and Verification) regulation to quantify the CO2 emissions for ships above 5000 gross tonnage. As a result, ship operators will have to monitor and report the verified amount of CO2 emitted by their vessels on voyages to, from and between EU ports and will also be required to provide information on energy efficiency parameters. The MRV is a data-oriented regulation requiring ship operators to capture and monitor the ship emissions and other related data and although it is a regional regulation at the moment there is scope for the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to implement it globally in the near future.

TI  - Modelling large-scale CO2 leakages in the North Sea
AB  - A three dimensional hydrodynamic model with a coupled carbonate speciation sub-model is used to simulate large additions of CO2 into the North Sea, representing leakages at potential carbon sequestration sites. A range of leakage scenarios are conducted at two distinct release sites, allowing an analysis of the seasonal, inter-annual and spatial variability of impacts to the marine ecosystem. Seasonally stratified regions are shown to be more vulnerable to CO2 release during the summer as the added CO2 remains trapped beneath the thermocline, preventing outgasing to the atmosphere. On average, CO2 injected into the northern North Sea is shown to reside within the water column twice as long as an equivalent addition in the southern North Sea before reaching the atmosphere. Short-term leakages of 5000 tonnes CO2 over a single day result in substantial acidification at the release sites (up to -1.92 pH units), with significant perturbations (greater than 0.1 pH units) generally confined to a 10 km radius. Long-term CO2 leakages sustained for a year may result in extensive plumes of acidified seawater, carried by major advective pathways. Whilst such scenarios could be harmful to marine biota over confined spatial scales, continued unmitigated CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are predicted to result in greater and more long-lived perturbations to the carbonate-system over the next few decades.

TI  - Environmental aspects of fusion reactors
AB  - With the continued depletion of fossil and uranium resources in the coming decades, the U.S. will be forced to look more toward renewable energy resources (e.g. wind, tidal, geothermal, and solar power) and toward such longer term and nondepletable energy resources as fissile fast breeder reactors and fusion power. Several reference reactor designs have been completed for full scale fusion power reactors that indicate that the environmental impacts from construction, operation, and eventual decommissioning of fusion reactors will be quite small. The principal environmental impact from fusion reactor operation will be from thermal discharges. Some of the safety and environmental characteristics that make fusion reactors appear attractive include an effectively infinite fuel supply at low cost, inherent incapability for a 'nuclear explosion' or a 'nuclear runaway', the absence of fission products, the flexibility of selecting low neutron cross section structural materials so that emergency core cooling for a loss of coolant or other accident will not be necessary, and the absence of special nuclear materials such as 235U or 239Pu, so that diversion of nuclear weapons materials will not be possible and nuclear blackmail will not be a serious concern.

TI  - Replacement of a 36-in gas riser using a hydraulically operated stopple
AB  - On the 36" Norpipe gas transmission line between Ekofisk and Emden, West Germany, the inlet riser on one of the booster platforms was damaged and needed replacement. To our knowledge this was the first time that a riser in the North Sea was replaced while maintaining a high gas pipeline pressure. This paper describes the application of a hydraulically operated stopple and the procedures developed for the actual riser replacement. Â© 1985 Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Electric propulsion in the Dutch inland shipping sector
AB  - Maritime industries are continuously in search of new opportunities to improve their environmental impact by eliminating air polluting and climate affecting emissions. Ships that can sail without producing any such local pollutants are referred to as zero-emission ships. In pursuit of enabling the breakthrough of such vessels smart combinations of fuel-cells, batteries and electric propulsion systems are needed to secure acceptable payloads, range and turn-around times. A Dutch FELMAR-consortium, consisting of Nedstack, MARIN, Damen Shipyards Group, Future Proof Shipping, Marine Service Noord and Holland Ship Electric, has been awarded a grant for the development of a new generation of fuel cell electric energy system for zero-emission ships. It has been revealed that electric and hybrid propulsion in the Dutch inland shipping sector is in an early phase and needs such joint efforts to realize the broader goal of reducing emissions.

TI  - TEMPORARY POWER GENERATION INSTALLATIONS OFFSHORE
AB  - Temporary diesel generation is often required to be installed on offshore facilities during production outages to maintain supplies to utilities systems. Platform power systems are often not designed to accommodate connection of temporary generation and engineering is required to ensure the power system operates reliably and safely. The design must consider multiple interfaces with electrical, control and process systems. This paper examines lessons learned from various temporary installations that have been used offshore. Consideration is given to the interface with the main power system, protection and earthing arrangements, nonstandard operation of existing equipment and process factors such as fuelling systems. Commercial drivers for various designs and operating scenarios are also analysed. The paper is intended to aid operators in selecting and designing appropriate temporary power installations.

TI  - Investigation of Operating Range of Marine Growth Removing ROV under Offshore Disturbances
AB  - Marine growth on offshore underwater structures is a problem as it reduces the lifespan. The structures are cleaned annually by manually operated ROVs. Automation of these ROVs can improve the removal efficiency, and thereby reduce the cleaning campaign time and cost, as it is challenging for the operators to manually stabilize the ROVs under the harsh offshore conditions. Waves, ocean currents, the attached tether and the cleaning tool all generate external forces to the ROVs acting as substantial disturbances which can be rejected by a controller. This study examines the operating range of a standard compact ROV subject to external disturbances. To analyze the cleaning performance a normalized performance parameter is defined which weight the relative distance of the water jet with the most efficient distance. The results show that the waves has a larger effect on the cleaning performance compared to the ocean current. This paper examines the operating range of a reconfigured BlueROV2. For Hs <= 1.4 m it is possible to clean in the entire operating range. To clean at all the considered sea states Hs <= 3m and ocean currents of 0.1 - 0.5 ms(-1) the ROV needs to be below 13 m.

TI  - REGULATION OF EFFLUENTS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL-POLICY
AB  - Adequate regulation of industrial effluent is integral to any strategy to reduce contaminants entering the North Sea. The present approach involves a list of identified priority Pollutants. Current regulatory frameworks are based upon environmental quality objectives or fixed emission limits, underpinned by the concept of assimilative capacity. These are examined and illustrated using examples from the UK River Tees and Antwerp Harbour in Belgium. Neither system is able to address the problem of complex effluents, and therefore cannot provide comprehensive environmental protection. These failings are discussed in relation to the role of clean production techniques and it is concluded that zero discharge must be recognised as the ultimate goal of North Sea environmental protection strategy.

TI  - Ac ship microgrids: Control and power management optimization
AB  - At sea, the electrical power system of a ship can be considered as an islanded microgrid. When connected to shore power at berth, the same power system acts as a grid connected microgrid or an extension of the grid. Therefore, ship microgrids show some resemblance to terrestrial microgrids. Nevertheless, due to the presence of large dynamic loads, such as electric propulsion loads, keeping the voltage and frequency within a permissible range and ensuring the continuity of supply are more challenging in ship microgrids. Moreover, with the growing demand for emission reductions and fuel efficiency improvements, alternative energy sources and energy storage technologies are becoming popular in ship microgrids. In this context, the integration of multiple energy sources and storage systems in ship microgrids requires an efficient power management system (PMS). These challenging environments and trends demand advanced control and power management solutions that are customized for ship microgrids. This paper presents a review on recent developments of control technologies and power management strategies proposed for AC ship microgrids. Â© 2018 by the authors.

TI  - GIS-based assessment of combined CSP electric power and seawater desalination plant for Duqum-Oman
AB  - This paper investigates the potential of implementing combined electric power and seawater desalination plant using concentrated solar power technologies for Wilayat Duqum in Oman. Duqum is going through a considerable urban, touristic and industrial expansion and development. GIS solar radiation tools are used to select the most appropriate site for the plant location. There are basically two different options to combine concentrated solar electric power with seawater desalination. The first option is to combine a CSP plant with a thermal desalination unit, exploiting the exhaust heat of the steam cycle to drive a thermal desalination unit. The second option is to exploit only the electricity output of the CSP plant with a reverse osmosis desalination unit. The paper deals with both options and shows where each of the concepts has advantages considering local conditions: the quality of the input water, the demand of freshwater and/or potable water, social and economic aspects, the environment and others.

TI  - Low carbon maritime transport: How speed, size and slenderness amounts to substantial capital energy substitution
AB  - Three responses that reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in maritime transport are slower speeds, larger vessels and slender hull designs. We use crude oil carriers as our illustrative example; these represent nearly a quarter of international sea cargo movements. We estimate the potential and costs in these which can all be described as capital substituting for energy and emissions. At different degrees of flexibility and time scales: speed reductions are feasible immediately when there are vessels available, though more capital will be tied up in cargo. Deployment of larger and more slender vessels to a greater extent requires fleet renovation, and also investments in ports and infrastructure. A novel finding in our analysis is that if bunker costs rise as a result of emission costs (fees, quotas), then this may depress speeds and emissions more than if they result from higher oil prices. The reason is that for higher oil prices, more capital tied up in cargo may give cargo owners an interest in speeding up, partly counteracting the impulse from fuel costs that tends to slow vessels down. Emission costs, in contrast, do not raise cargo values. Â© 2015 The Authors.

TI  - Next generation of multipath screens solves deepwater completion challenges
AB  - A major issue for deepwater high rate wells is delivering completion reliability and performance that ensures well life sand control and operational simplicity. Multi-path screen systems are designed to ensure placement of the annular gravel pack in frac pack applications by transporting proppant slurry past annular bridges or by filling voids within the pack and in open hole by bypassing areas of formation collapse. The next generation of multi-path screen technology has been optimized to reduce rig time, eliminate excessive fluid velocity and provide enhanced proppant placement by incorporating a spiral design. This paper reviews the design improvements, testing and development process for technology advancement, as well as the field installation process and results of delivering void free annular gravel placement in high rate wells. The first field installations of the next generation multi-path screen were in the deepwater subsea development, Simian/Sienna, offshore Egypt. The application of this technology was driven by the need to have placement of an effective sand control completion in the presence of highly reactive shales. Analysis showed that the most productive completion method was an open-hole completion. This completion type was challenging given that water based fluids were to be used for drilling and completing with exposed reactive shales. The operational risks were centered around completing the wells from a floating rig while experiencing hole instability during completion equipment placement and while placing the annular gravel pack. To ensure well life sand control, the latest state of the art multi-path screen system was chosen because of its ease of assembly, ability to transport proppant slurry past annular blockages, and the minimization of multi-path tube slurry exit velocity. For proppant transport, the latest non-ionic viscoelastic surfactant (VES) was selected for its shale stabilizing properties, excellent sand suspension and transport properties, and high return permeability characteristics.

TI  - Research and application of the optical fiber technology for real-time temperature test of offshore thermal wells
AB  - Thermal recovery method with horizontal wells has been conducted in Bohai Oilfield for almost ten years. The horizontal section length of the horizontal well is about 300 m. For thermal wells, monitoring the real-time temperature data downhole is of importance for analyzing the temperature distribution and variation rules along the wellbore, and consequently improving the produced degree of the horizontal wells. Different kinds of high-temperature monitoring technologies are summarized and the high-temperature optical fiber is selected for temperature monitoring of the offshore thermal wells. The steam injection tubing with functions of temperature monitoring is designed by using the optical fiber. In the horizontal section, the optical fiber is installed inside the steam injection tubing, goes outside of the tubing through a Y-joint, and connects to the surface along the annulus. Thus, the optical fiber could monitoring temperature of both the horizontal section and the annulus. Two target well are selected for project design and put into field application during the steam injection process. The monitoring results show that the high-temperature optical fiber works normally for about one month while the steam injection temperature is about 350Â°C. Besides, with the real-time temperature monitoring, the upward movement of the steam in the annulus is also observed and controlled by adjusting the Nitrogen injection parameters in the annulus. This is the first time that the optical fiber technology is applied in offshore thermal wells, which would be important for verification of wellbore parameter calculation and analysis of the casing variation when heated during the steam injection process. The successful application of the optical fiber in offshore thermal well would provide a guidance for the subsequent offshore thermal exploitation. Â© 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers

TI  - Carbon sequestration in macroalgal mats of brackish-water habitats in Indian Sunderbans: Potential as renewable organic resource
AB  - Large influx of excess nutrients into sub-tropical brackish-water habitats is expected to radically affect the algal populations in the heavily populated Sunderbans brackish-water ecozone. Twelve selected brackish-water sites in the Indian Sunderbans were surveyed to investigate the growth performance of mat-forming dominant algal/cyanobacterial macrophytes and their potential for carbon (C) sequestration into hydrologic and pedologic pools. The mats were dominated by particular taxa at different seasons related to physico-chemical properties of the wet-land habitats. Different environmental variables and biomass productivity parameters were measured on fortnightly basis to assess the carbon cycle related to dominant algal blooms of the study area. The dominating species at the twelve sites included seven genera (Spirogyra, Rhizoclonium, Ulva, Cladophora, Pithophora, Chaetomorpha) belonging to Chlorophyta, three genera (Polysiphonia, Gracilaria, Catenella) belonging to Rhodophyta and Lyngbya majuscula from cyanobacteria. Multivariate statistical methods indicated that nutrient availability, particularly dissolved P concentration and N:P ratio in the water column, along with salinity in the water column mainly affected biomass yield and C sequestration of mat-forming macrophytes and OC input into water column. However, OC contents of underlying muck proved to be very stable, though small influxes of OC occurred at each bloom. High biomass yields (34-3107 g/m(2)) of the dominant mat components accumulated enormous stocks of OC, very little of which reaches the pedologic pool. This transient biomass might be utilized as dietary supplements or biofuel feedstocks. Availability of important dietary fatty acids in Spirogyra punctulata, Gracilaria sp., Polysiphonia mollis, Rhizoclonium riparium, R. tortuosum, Pithophora oedogonia and Ulva lactuca was considered as suitability of these species as nutraceuticals. Fatty acid compositions of L. majuscula, Catenella repens, R. tortuosum and Cladophora crystallina were estimated to be applicable for producing biodiesel for usage in sub-tropical climates.

TI  - The Daunting Climate Change: Science, Impacts, Adaptation & Mitigation Strategies, Policy Responses
AB  - The book starts with an overview of Climate Science. It discusses the signs of Warming, the impacts and consequences on several sectors - terrestrial and coastal ecosystems, water resources, ocean systems, agriculture, food production and food security, human health and safety, livelihoods and poverty, Arctic populations, low-lying States, so on. Mathematical models to project future climate and the resulting concerns, global adaptation experiences, and opportunities for future execution are explained. The mitigation approaches, chiefly decarbonizing the energy sector by developing and applying clean/low carbon energy sources and improving energy efficiency, and the evolving geoengineering schemes are dealt. Carbon pricing, an economic tool to ensure emissions reductions, and transition to a low carbon economy to stimulate sustainable growth are described. The continued global efforts under the UN or otherwise until the recent Paris Agreement to arrive at policy responses to tackle this intriguing but daunting problem of climate change are vividly expounded.

TI  - Effect of site elevation and soil depth on the biomass and carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus stocks of roots in planted Kandelia obovata mangrove forests
AB  - Site elevation is one of the most important factors for successful mangrove restoration. Understanding how site elevation influences mangrove roots is critical for evaluating mangrove primary productivity, carbon dynamics and nutrient cycles. Root biomass and organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (N), and total phosphorus (P) stocks were compared through an in situ experiment among 11-year-old Kandelia obovata mangrove forests planted under three intertidal elevations. Compared with site upper elevation, biomass of total root, live root, dead root, fine root, and coarse root decreased approximately 74.62, 79.82, 26.65, 42.52, and 87.09%, respectively, but contribution rates of fine root to total root increased 35.40% at site lower elevation. Biomass of total root and fine root at the three sites decreased with soil depth increases. Stocks of OC, N, and P in the total root decreased approximately 70, 52.92, and 47.30% from site upper elevation to site lower elevation owing to decreases in the total root biomass. Stocks of OC, N, and P in the total root and fine root also decreased with soil depth increases, while only OC stock of coarse root had a decreasing trend with soil depth increases. These indicated that decreases in site elevation will reduce mangrove primary productivity, carbon dynamics, and nutrient cycles due to decreases in root biomass. For K.obovata forests, upper elevation should be used in the future mangrove forest restoration projects to improve mangrove blue carbon capability. Â© 2022 Society for Ecological Restoration.

TI  - Energy dynamics and its implication to biosphere-atmosphere exchange of CO2, H2O and CH4 in a tropical mangrove forest canopy
AB  - Amount of radiant energy (short wave) available to drive biosphere-atmosphere exchange of CO2, H2O, CH4 and for transfer into other energy forms were determined for a tropical mangrove forest at the land ocean boundary of north-east (NE) coast of Bay of Bengal from January to December 2006. The mean annual incoming short wave radiation (435Â±32.8 W m-2) was partitioned into 29% sensible heat, 35% latent heat, 4% ground heat, 7% physical storage energy and 10% photosynthetic storage energy. The mean budget closing energy flux (68.96Â±24.6 W m-2) or, budget error was 15.8% of incoming short wave radiation. In Varimax factor analysis, budget closing energy flux showed high loading in association with leaf chlorophyll of different mangrove species, indicating its major role for reflectivity of the surface for short wave. There was significant seasonality in CO2 exchange with net primary productivity of 14.1 Î¼mol m-2 s-1. The mean methane emission was found higher (7.29 Î¼g m-2 s-1) during the daytime than that of night time (1.37 Î¼g m-2 s-1) with maximum methane emission rates of 36.1 and 21.1 Î¼g m-2 s-1 in December and January, respectively. Stepwise multiple regression analysis between storage energy [Î”Hs(P)] and fluxes of CO2, CH4, H (sensible heat), HL (latent heat of evaporation), Î”R (budget closer energy) showed that the combined explained variability for CO2 flux, evapotranspiration and budget closer energy (39%) was less than that of CH4 and sensible heat flux (46%). The extent of warming effect by CH4 and sensible heat flux was predominant over the resultant cooling effect due to the processes such as photosynthesis, evapotranspiration and albedo. The mangrove forest with two trademarks of low albedo and high surface roughness was poorly coupled to the environment. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Achieving sustainable aquaculture: Historical and current perspectives and future needs and challenges
AB  - Important operational changes that have gradually been assimilated and new approaches that are developing as part of the movement toward sustainable intensive aquaculture production systems are presented via historical, current, and future perspectives. Improved environmental and economic sustainability based on increased efficiency of production continues to be realized. As a result, aquaculture continues to reduce its carbon footprint through reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Reduced use of freshwater and land resources per unit of production, improved feed management practices as well as increased knowledge of nutrient requirements, effective feed ingredients and additives, domestication of species, and new farming practices are now being applied or evaluated. Successful expansion into culture of marine species, both off and on shore, offers the potential of substantial increases in sustainable intensive aquaculture production combined with integrative efforts to increase efficiency will principally contribute to satisfying the increasing global demand for protein and food security needs.

TI  - â€œNaturalâ€ Climate Solutions Could Speed Up Mitigation, With Risks. Additional Options Are Needed.
AB  - Mitigation of climate change by intentionally storing carbon in tropical forests, soils, and wetlands and by reducing greenhouse gas fluxes from these settings has been promoted as rapidly deployable and cost-effective. This approach, sometimes referred to as â€œnatural climate solutions,â€ could keep post-industrialization warming below 1.5Â Â°C, when coupled with reductions in fossil fuel emissions, as confirmed here with a simple numerical model of future emissions. However, such mitigation could cease in response to changes in future climate, land use, or natural resource policies, or there could be CO2 released from reservoirs of stored carbon. Model simulations suggest cumulative emissions could be similar, under scenarios where carbon storage ceases, or stored carbon is released, to emissions expected in the absence of any natural mitigation. If climate change is to be minimized, no-regrets approaches to natural mitigation should be considered (e.g., by reducing deforestation), as emissions targets that could limit warming to 1.5Â Â°C cannot be met without mitigation of this magnitude. However, additional mitigation options should also be evaluated that can reduce CO2 emissions and remove CO2 from the air (and store it permanently). Â© 2020 The Authors.

TI  - State-of-the-Art Methods to Improve Energy Efficiency of Ships
AB  - Generating energy efficiency through behavioural change requires not only understanding and empathy with user interests and needs but also the fostering of energy saving awareness, a technique and framework that supports operators and ship owners. There is strong potential to make use of different technical solutions to increase energy efficiency, but many cost-efficient solutions relate to carrot-and-stick incentives for operators to minimise energy consumption. These incentives range from voyage planning with weather routing eco-driving bonus, to torque limitations and changes in company policies, all of which demonstrate that the operators' on-board importance for the energy consumption has been identified. Data collection will allow operators to make better decisions in the lifecycle of the ship from knowledge-driven design to operation, redesign and lifetime extension. Various systems are available for data acquisition, storage and analysis, some of which are delivered by well-known marine suppliers while others are stand-alone systems. The lack of standardization for data capture, transmission and analysis is a challenge, so systematic improvement is required in shipping companies to achieve energy savings. When these are achieved, they will be the result of customer requirements, cost pressure or individual driving forces in the companies. The potential energy savings, brought up in interviews, shows up to 35\% on specific routes and up to 60\% in specific maneuvers. These savings will be made feasible by operators and crews being involved in the decision-making process.

TI  - Cultivation study of the marine microalga Picochlorum oculatum and outdoor deployment in a novel bioreactor for high-density production of algal cell mass
AB  - Microalgae are considered a promising source of renewable diesel and jet fuel. Currently, large-scale microalgae cultivations are performed in open ponds because of their low capital and operating costs, but they generally suffer from low cell mass yield and high risk of contamination. A novel, cost-effective, and modular horizontal bioreactor (HBR) for algae cultivation was developed, as described in the present study. The HBR was designed to keep costs low and was engineered to minimize water and energy use while enhancing CO2 and nutrient uptake. The selected marine microalgal strain, Picochlorum oculatum (Nannochloris oculata), has shown potential for biofuel production. A series of controlled indoor growth experiments was first performed to identify the appropriate P. oculatum growth conditions before demonstrating the HBR performance. Supplying CO2 continuously or by pH-control (pulsed) did not affect culture progression. Growth on urea and nitrate yielded comparable results, while ammonium was less effective. Varying inoculum size from 10% to 15% or 20% had no significant effect on lag time and final cell concentration and comparable growth was measured in the 7â€“8 pH range. The 150-L HBR's performance was successfully demonstrated outdoors by growing P. oculatum at the identified growth conditions selected to reduce operating costs (pH-controlled CO2, pH 7.5, 10% inoculum, and nitrate). High-density growth was achieved without any contamination issues in outdoor HBR cultivations over 68 days in central Florida during two consecutive growth cycles. Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Technologies to improve ship efficiency and reduce harmful emissions
AB  - Marine transportation is considered as an integral part of the global economy as more than 90 per cent of global trade goods are carried through the sea. The shipping industry underwent a tremendous growth during the last century (from 2.6 billion tons annual shipments in 1970 to 9.2 billion tons annual shipments in 2012). The industrial revolution and unrestricted transcontinental trade have catalyzed the global trade volume. Nowadays; merchant ships, approximately 50,000 in number, are sailing across the globe to deliver cargoes of various kinds. On the other hand, the shipping industry is also responsible for a notable amount of total CO2 emissions and several other harmful air pollutants such as Sulfur Oxides, Nitrogen Oxides and Particulate Matter. It may, however, be noted that shipping continues to remain a better environmental option for commercial transportation compared to other available means due to lowest gCO2/ton.km emissions. There is indeed an unrelenting requirement for further improvements in energy efficiency and emissions reduction in the shipping industry as global shipping volume is predicted to continue growing significantly in future. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has been vigorously seeking for new measures for further improvements in energy efficiency and emissions reduction, and swift implementation of these measures to reduce the harmful emissions from international shipping. A major improvement in fuel efficiency and significant reductions in harmful emissions from ships has been achieved over the past decades through improved powering technologies and increasing energy-efficiency of engine and propulsion systems. These technologies can be divided into three major groups, i.e., machinery options, propeller efficiency options and alternate powering options. In this chapter; a comprehensive overview of these green ship technologies is presented which includes basic concepts, principles and potential, related core issues and possible solutions.

TI  - Higher soil organic carbon sequestration potential at a rehabilitated mangrove comprised of Aegiceras corniculatum compared to Kandelia obovata
AB  - The present study compared the ecosystem organic carbon (OC) stocks and soil OC sources between two 12-year-old monospecific mangrove sites comprised of different species (Kandelia obovata in tree form and Aegiceras corniculatum in shrub form). We tested whether the carbon sequestration performance following rehabilitation varied with plantation of species in different forms and whether mangrove vegetation sequestrate OC more rapidly than soil pool. The results showed that mangrove rehabilitation increased the ecosystem OC stock relative to that of a non-vegetated bare flat. The accumulation of soil carbon was accompanied by increased soil total nitrogen contents and decreased Î´13C values of soil OC, indicating that the increases in OC and TN contents were a function of accumulation of 13C-depleted mangrove materials in the soil. The sequestrated OC over the 12 years was considerably less in soil than in biomass at each mangrove site, suggesting that mangrove vegetation contributes more rapidly than the soil to ecosystem OC sequestration following rehabilitation before the vegetation has reached maturity. Compilation of the carbon stocks from worldwide rehabilitated mangrove forests with various ages further supports this finding. The K. obovata site had an apparently higher biomass OC stock but less OC in the soil than those at the A. corniculatum site. There was a higher standing leaf litter stock on the forest floor and more mangrove materials incorporated into the top 15 cm soil at the A. corniculatum site. These results suggested that the two rehabilitated mangrove sites had different development trajectories of both biomass and soil OC sequestration. Moreover, the performance of ecosystem carbon sequestration was related to plantation of different mangrove species. These carbon sequestration feature of rehabilitated mangrove forests therefore deserve attention in future rehabilitation programs to promote carbon sequestration performance. Â© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Essentials of Marine Biotechnology
AB  - Coastal countries have traditionally relied on the existing marine resources (e.g., fishing, food, transport, recreation, and tourism) as well as tried to support new economic endeavors (ocean energy, desalination for water supply, and seabed mining). Modern societies and lifestyle resulted in an increased demand for dietary diversity, better health and well-being, new biomedicines, natural cosmeceuticals, environmental conservation, and sustainable energy sources. These societal needs stimulated the interest of researchers on the diverse and underexplored marine environments as promising and sustainable sources of biomolecules and biomass, and they are addressed by the emerging field of marine (blue) biotechnology. Blue biotechnology provides opportunities for a wide range of initiatives of commercial interest for the pharmaceutical, biomedical, cosmetic, nutraceutical, food, feed, agricultural, and related industries. This article synthesizes the essence, opportunities, responsibilities, and challenges encountered in marine biotechnology and outlines the attainment and valorization of directly derived or bio-inspired products from marine organisms. First, the concept of bioeconomy is introduced. Then, the diversity of marine bioresources including an overview of the most prominent marine organisms and their potential for biotechnological uses are described. This is followed by introducing methodologies for exploration of these resources and the main use case scenarios in energy, food and feed, agronomy, bioremediation and climate change, cosmeceuticals, bio-inspired materials, healthcare, and well-being sectors. The key aspects in the fields of legislation and funding are provided, with the emphasis on the importance of communication and stakeholder engagement at all levels of biotechnology development. Finally, vital overarching concepts, such as the quadruple helix and Responsible Research and Innovation principle are highlighted as important to follow within the marine biotechnology field. The authors of this review are collaborating under the European Commission-funded Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action Ocean4Biotech â€“ European transdisciplinary networking platform for marine biotechnology and focus the study on the European state of affairs.

TI  - Preliminary Results of the Life plus Project: CO-ordinated Approach for Sediment Treatment and Beneficial Reuse in Small Harbours Networks
AB  - Dredging operations in harbour and marine coastal areas, usually performed to maintain operational water-depth, might represent a viable option to mitigate environmental pollution if applied to remove contaminated sediments from the water body. Sediment landfilling could generate relevant environmental burdens due to the amounts of materials to be disposed of; however, the implementation of alternative management options aimed at re-use is hindered by the high cost of technology and the absence of a market for the recovered materials. The present project, named COAST BEST ``CO-ordinated Approach for Sediment Treatment and BEneficial reuse in Small harbours networks{''} and funded in the framework of the LIFE08+ ENV European call, is aimed to find out a method to integrate all the phases of sediments management, through the creation of a network-based system including different small harbours, i.e., harbours of regional/interregional relevance, which can be geographically interconnected.

TI  - Offshore methane hydrates in the gulf of Mexico: A study in economic viability
AB  - Methane hydrates have long been discussed as the next cradle of energy. Considered a resource of near infinite reserve potential, methane hydrates could supplant conventional hydrocarbon-based energy for the foreseeable future. In recent years there has been considerable activity in the petroleum industry to fully understand onshore and offshore hydrate deposits and methods of extraction and production; however, a commercial scale level has not been achieved. While there have been efforts to commercialize methane hydrate development in some parts of the world, the Gulf of Mexico remains relatively unexplored in this arena. This paper evaluates the economic viability of a commercial scale offshore methane hydrate production operation in the Gulf of Mexico-by creating a sample capital cost budget.

TI  - A COMBINED NONLINEAR MOORING-LINE and UMBILICAL CABLE DYNAMICS MODEL and APPLICATION
AB  - Subsea umbilical cable modeling has been widely employed in solving practical engineering problems, including wave energy converter (WEC) array system, offshore oil and gas platforms and floating production systems, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) in naval operations, and oceanographic mapping, monitoring, and sampling. For analysis and design of these systems, an accurate, efficient, and reliable computational model is necessary. In this study, a combined nonlinear mooringline and umbilical dynamics with bending capability (MUDB) model is developed and validated. The newly developed model is integrated into an open-source wave energy converter simulator, WEC-Sim and used to simulate and analyze the practical offshore WEC and WEC array system. A two-body floating point absorber (FPA) WEC system is simulated and analyzed. The accurate predictions in both statics and dynamics demonstrate the outstanding capabilities of the model applied in analyzing the WEC dynamic response and WEC design. Then the integration model is applied to simulate and analyze a section of advanced WEC array design of the FPA system by adding a power cord to the FPA spar connected to a floating static hub.

TI  - Using an aquifer as CO2 buffer storage
AB  - We investigate the prospect of using an offshore aquifer for both CO2 sequestration and as buffer storage for CO2-based enhanced oil recovery (EOR), to reduce the cost of storage and increase flexibility and availability of the CO2. We review the state changes in the well, water content in back-produced CO2, pressure and temperature development of CO2 in well and reservoir, for both injection and back-production. We find that although there is a small window for back-production, it places a high demand on operational stringency and will only deliver a small portion of the total CO2 injected. Our conclusion is that such a project is only theoretically possible and is not recommended. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Contracts: RWE invests in CCGT technology
AB  - RWE npower will invest $978 million for the construction of a gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine power station in the UK. The innovative design will lower emissions considerably. The construction contract was awarded to Alstom, and is expected to begin building the plant in 2009, with scheduled startup in 2009. RWE npower is considering two former plant sites in the UK - one in Pembroke, the other in Nottinghamshire. The former would host a 2000 Mw plant and the latter a 1500 Mw plant. Meanwhile, RWE npower has begun a feasibility study on carbon capture and storage at its coal-fired power station in Essex, UK, assessing options for capturing CO2 from power generation, transporting it and storing it permanently underground. This would most likely be in the North Sea, where it could be used in a process for EOR.

TI  - Future feed resources in sustainable salmonid production: A review
AB  - Aquaculture is one of the most resource-efficient and sustainable ways to produce animal protein. The Food and Agriculture Organization predicts that cultivated aquatic species will provide around 53\% of the world's seafood supply by 2030. Further growth of intensive farmed aquatic species may be limited by a shortage of feed resources. The aquaculture sector therefore needs to intensify its search for alternative ingredients based on renewable natural resources. A significant increase in production will require an accelerated transition in technology and production systems, better use of natural available resources, development of high-quality alternative feed resources and exploitation of available space. The present review discusses the urgent need to identify appropriate alternative ingredients for a sustainable future salmonid production. We describe and evaluate the most promising marine ingredients, including low-trophic species (mesopelagic fish, zooplankton, polychaetes, macroalgae and crustaceans), novel microbial ingredients (bacteria, yeast and microalgae), insects (black soldier fly, yellow meal worm and crickets), animal by-products (poultry meal, meat and bone meal, blood meal and hydrolysed feather meal) and by-products from other commercial productions (trimmings and blood). Furthermore, we discuss the available volumes and need for new processing technologies and refining methods to ensure commercial production of nutritionally healthy ingredients. The essential production steps and considerations for future development of sustainable and safe seafood production are also discussed.

TI  - Gas migration pathways, controlling mechanisms and changes in sediment acoustic properties observed in a controlled sub-seabed CO2 release experiment
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a key technology to potentially mitigate global warming by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial facilities and power generation that escape into the atmosphere. To broaden the usage of geological storage as a viable climate mitigation option, it is vital to understand CO2 behaviour after its injection within a storage reservoir, including its potential migration through overlying sediments, as well as biogeochemical and ecological impacts in the event of leakage. The impacts of a CO2 release were investigated by a controlled release experiment that injected CO2 at a known flux into shallow, under-consolidated marine sediments for 37 days. Repeated high-resolution 2D seismic reflection surveying, both pre-release and syn-release, allows the detection of CO2-related anomalies, including: seismic chimneys; enhanced reflectors within the subsurface; and bubbles within the water column. In addition, reflection coefficient and seismic attenuation values calculated for each repeat survey, allow the impact of CO2 flux on sediment acoustic properties to be comparatively monitored throughout the gas release. CO2 migration is interpreted as being predominantly controlled by sediment stratigraphy in the early stages of the experiment. However, either the increasing flow rate, or the total injected volume become the dominant factors determining CO2 migration later in the experiment. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Perspectives of offshore geothermal energy in Italy
AB  - Italy is the first European and world's fifth largest producer of geothermal energy for power generation which actually accounts for less than 2\% of the total electricity production of the country. In this paper after a brief introduction to the basic elements of high-enthalpy geothermal systems, we discuss the potentialities represented by the submarine volcanoes of the South Tyrrhenian Sea. In particular we focus on Marsili Seamount which, according to the literature data, can be considered as a possible first offshore geothermal field; then we give a summary of the related exploitation pilot project that may lead to the realization of a 200MWe prototype power plant. Finally we discuss some economic aspects and the development perspectives of the offshore geothermal resource taking into account the Italian energy framework and Europe 2020 renewable energy target.

The efforts to develop methods that would make production of methane from hydrate both technologically feasible and economically viable are also presented. Methane hydrate is a very efficient storehouse of energy, and when dissociated, a single cubic foot of solid hydrate releases as much as 180 cubic feet of methane gas. work at the Mallik site in the Canadian Arctic has established that production of methane from hydrates is technologically feasible. The US national methane hydrate research program is now performing field and laboratory studies designed to accelerate the commercially viable production of methane from hydrate in Alaska.

TI  - Exergy estimate of a novel hybrid solar-gas power and organic Rankine cycle-based hydrogen-production system
AB  - This study proposes a novel hybrid solar-gas power and hydrogen-production system, which is comprised by the solar tower thermal system, gas-steam turbine combined cycle and organic Rankine cycle-based hydrogen-production system. Based on the Ebsilon code, the operation processes of the hybrid system are simulated. The results show that the output power and electric efficiency of the hybrid system are 103.9 MW and 41.3%, and the daily hydrogen output is 62.2 kg. The operation simulation results of the hybrid system reveal that the gas-steam combined cycle and solar island can both achieve stable operations, and the power generation section and hydrogen-production device can both work effectively, which means the hybrid system is technically feasible. The exergy estimate results of the hybrid system show that the combustion chamber and solar receiver have the two largest exergy destructions, which are 56.5 MW and 45.3 MW. That means the performances of the two components can be further improved. For the hydrogen-production system, the exergy destructions of the proton exchange membrane electrolyzer, turbine, condenser and evaporator of the organic Rankine cycle are 0.156 MW, 0.111 MW, 2.338 MW and 1.891 MW, and the corresponding exergy efficiencies are 51.2%, 92.6%, 80.7% and 79.5%, respectively.

TI  - Technical and economic feasibility of storing CO2 in mature fractured monterey reservoirs of offshore California
AB  - In this paper we present a study on the feasibility of utilizing the mature Monterey oilfields of offshore California for sequestering carbon dioxide while potentially enhancing crude oil recovery from the tight matrix. An important characteristic of these fields is that, because of natural fractures, well productivities have been high and as a result, a significant amount of reservoir voidage has been generated in each field by production of more than 780 million barrels of oil and more than a TCF of natural gas during the last three decades. These productions translate into a computed voidage of about a billion barrels allowing storage of more than 90 Million tons of CO2. This is roughly equivalent to storing 50 years of CO2 from a 400 MW Power plant. Another important observation discussed in the paper is the cap rock sealing nature of these fields allowing preservation of the oil and initial pressure as evidenced from the analyses of the initial GOR data. Furthermore many of these fields will be at the verge of abandonment during the next two decades unless steps are taken to enhance recovery by extracting oil from the tight matrix. CO2 extraction from tight rocks is a technically feasible process and our analysis indicate that CO2 storage can indeed prolong the life of many of these fields and enhance matrix oil recovery. An important infrastructure requirement for CO2 transportation into these offshore fields is the cost of building offshore pipelines. Availability of existing multiple pipelines connecting the fields to their corresponding onshore treatment facilities solves this transportation of CO2 to the offshore fields. Finally, these fields are under active water influx, where aquifers may provide additional CO2 storage possibilities. Copyright 2015, Carbon Management Technology Conference.

TI  - Evaluation of Different Techniques of Active Thermography for Quantification of Artificial Defects in Fiber-Reinforced Composites Using Thermal and Phase Contrast Data Analysis
AB  - For assuring the safety and reliability of components and constructions in energy applications made of fiber-reinforced polymers (e.g., blades of wind turbines and tidal power plants, engine chassis, flexible oil and gas pipelines) innovative non-destructive testing methods are required. Within the European project VITCEA complementary methods (shearography, microwave, ultrasonics and thermography) have been further developed and validated. Together with partners from the industry, test specimens have been constructed and selected on-site containing different artificial and natural defect artefacts. As base materials, carbon and glass fibers in different orientations and layering embedded in different matrix materials (epoxy, polyamide) have been considered. In this contribution, the validation of flash and lock-in thermography to these testing problems is presented. Data analysis is based on thermal contrasts and phase evaluation techniques. Experimental data are compared to analytical and numerical models. Among others, the influence of two different types of artificial defects (flat bottom holes and delaminations) with varying diameters and depths and of two different materials (CFRP and GFRP) with unidirectional and quasi-isotropic fiber alignment is discussed.

TI  - Low energy desalination and wind energy - sustainable solutions for drinking water production
AB  - ENERCON has manufactured and installed more than 6940 wind energy converters world wide with a total installed capacity of 5.8 GW with an energy production of more than 8.2 billion kWh/y. ENERCON also applies its technical and management know-how to desalination plants and has developed technical solutions for environmentally friendly desalination processes. The use of additives within membrane processes for antiscaling and antifouling can be avoided by physical effects during water flow. Prototypes on Mediterranean islands work without using any additives a benefit for the marine environment (Barcelona Convention), for water quality and less expense for chemicals. ENERCON plants are low noise installations which can therefore be built close to drinking water consumers. The upcoming emission trading model (Kyoto Protocol) will also concern desalination plant operators, especially in the European Union. The energy levels in renewable energy resources fluctuate. For an energy efficient combination with desalination plants ENERCON has developed technical solutions so that plants can control the fluctuation of energy supply related to renewable energy resources. These desalination plants do not have a fixed point of operation plants run in a range of 20-100\% energy availability at optimum efficiency - with low energy consumption. Attention has to be turned to wind energy. Generally, desalination plants are located on the coast - which also presents excellent conditions for wind power, especially on islands. The system can work completely independently in regions without stable or any electrical networks, as well as integrated into a public net. During strong wind there is more energy available than the desalination process needs, so it can be fed into the public net. When wind, conditions are poor the energy support can work the other way round. An innovative combination of desalination processes and renewable wind power can create a holistic system for water and even for energy supply. Also not being dependent on fossil energy sources may become a bigger advantage than we can expect nowadays. The prices for oil may rise in the future and the transport costs for oil (by ships or trucks) will remain a fixed expense. Investment costs per kWh from wind energy converters are steadily decreasing! Transport, setup, and expansion of ENERCON desalination plants are easily implemented because of the modular design. However, the combination with wind energy is not a must since plants fit together with all kinds of existing networks. Economic reasons are of main importance for decision makers in water services. Apart from saving expenses for fossil energy resources and additives, ENERCON desalination plants also reduce personnel costs because of fully automatic operation and a remote monitoring system. Operators can observe the plant from their offices and maintenance staff is informed about eventual problems by SMS.

TI  - Spray Combustion Analysis of Humins
AB  - Second generation biomass is an attractive renewable feedstock for transport fuels. Its sulfur content is generally negligible and the carbon cycle is reduced from millions to tens of years. One hitherto non-valorized feedstock are so-called humins, a residual product formed in the conversion of sugars to platform chemicals, such as hydroxymethylfurfural and methoxymethylfurfural, intermediates in the production of FDCA, a building block used to produce the polyethylene furanoate (PEF) bottle by Avantium. The focus of this study is to investigate the spray combustion behavior of humins as a renewable alternative for heavy fuel oil (HFO) under large two-stroke engine-like conditions in an optically accessible constant volume chamber. To reduce the viscosity to HFO levels of the otherwise crystalline humins, methyl levulinate (ML), another side-stream from the same sugar dehydration process, is blended to the former compound at 25 wt.-%; a ratio comparable to that actually produced in many dehydration processes. Various fuel properties of interest, including elemental composition, heating value, density, ignition quality, acid number, flash point, pour point, carbon residue, sediment, water and ash content are measured for the resulting humins-ML blend. The blend is injected into an optically accessible constant volume chamber, the dimensions, injector characteristics and prevailing ambient conditions of which are representative of those found in large two-stroke marine engines. Commercial HFO is used as a benchmark. The combustion process is evaluated by means of shadow imaging and OHâˆ—-chemiluminescence. The former and latter optical techniques are used to determine the phasing and overall magnitude of the heat release event, and ignition delay/location and flame lift off length, respectively. From the results becomes clear that the average ignition delay is comparable to that of HFO, albeit at a higher cycle-to-cycle variation. Notwithstanding a longer lift off length and more downstream ignition kernels, the overall results suggest that the proposed bio-blend is a feasible renewable alternative for HFO in terms of technical feasibility.

TI  - A review of ice protection techniques for structures in the arctic and offshore harsh environments
AB  - Icing can jeopardize local infrastructure, hinder field operation, destroy vessel superstructures, and threaten life and property safety in the Arctic and other cold offshore and marine environments. Research on ice protection (both anti-icing and de-icing) technologies is critical to equipment, structures, and personnel in these environments. This review systematically evaluates a wide range of ice protection techniques divided into three main categories, i.e., active, passive, and hybrid ice protection techniques. Active anti-icing/de-icing technologies include mechanical, thermal, or chemical methods, requiring an additional energy source to prevent ice formation or remove accumulated ice from the target surfaces. Passive anti-icing/de-icing techniques can prevent ice accumulation or reduce ice adhesion without external energy sources; they create and maintain the icephobic properties of the target surfaces. Excessive energy consumption is a major technical limitation of active ice protection technologies. On the other hand, it is challenging for any passive technology to meet the long-term ice protection requirements in the Arctic or different cold offshore/marine environments. A combination of two or more active and passive ice protection methods, i.e., a hybrid approach, seems promising and can be applied in various situations according to the specific requirements of different vessels, offshore structures, and equipment.

TI  - Zero emissions wellboat powered by hydrogen fuel cells hybridised with batteries
AB  - Due to the more stringent regulations on pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime transport sector, solutions are being sought to reduce or avoid the emissions generated during the operation of ships. The onboard installation of hydrogen-fuelled fuel cells is a solution respectful with the environment and the marine ecosystem through which ships navigate. In this work, the design of a wellboat and its power plant based on fuel cells fed with hydrogen and hybridised with batteries is conducted, making it a zero-emissions ship that can navigate Emission Control Areas (ECAs). The fuel cells used are polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), and the hydrogen they consume is stored in tanks pressurised at 35 MPa, grouping these tanks into three standard containers (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units) installed on an exposed deck. The electrical and propulsion needs of the ship are covered by the installed power plant, providing an average power of 1266 kW and a peak power of 2624 kW, making it possible to avoid the emission of 10.8 t of CO2, 195 kg of NOx and 9 kg of SOx per 14 h mission.

TI  - High Voltage Ship-to-Shore Connection for Electric Power Supply Support in Landing Operations: an analysis
AB  - The increasingly presence of HVSC connection onboard ships opens the path for innovative applications, such as ship-to-shore connection. Indeed, it is possible to supply power to land during emergency (mainly to deployed camps/bases), thanks to the electric power generation capabilities of modern all electric ships. However, the use of the same system to provide both the HVSC and ship-to-shore connection functions require a careful assessment of the equipment to be installed both onboard and on land. To achieve that, ship-to-shore connection requires a shore side mobile substation, containing all the necessary equipment for the land power distribution, and a ship side substation, either implemented in shipboard power system or installable at need. To successfully implement such a system, an appropriate design of protection systems is required, assuring proper protection to equipment and people. Moreover, the capability of the ship-toshore connection to supply an existing land power system implies a high rate of adaptability, and a careful assessment of the land power system's grounding and protections. The development of such technology will be relevant for military applications, but civilian application is possible and foreseen in future (dual-use technology). In this paper, an analysis of possible ship-to-shore connection configurations is made, together with considerations about protection of both the connection equipment and the supplied land power systems.

TI  - Post 2020, CCS will be costcompetitive with other low-carbon energy technologies
AB  - The costs of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the key findings from Zero Emissions Platform's (ZEP) study, which aimed to estimate the costs of complete CCS value chains for coal- and gas-fired power plants located at a generic site in northern Europe from the early 2020s are presented. ZEP's study indicates that the EU CCS demonstration program will not only prove the costs of CCS, but provide the basis for future cost reductions, enhanced by the introduction of second- and third-generation technologies. Recent reports such as the IEA's Projected Costs of Generating Electricity - 2010 indicate that the costs of post-demonstration CCS with coal and gas, as presented in ZEP's study, will be cost-competitive with other low-carbon power options, including on-/off shore wind, solar power, and nuclear. Location and type of storage site, reservoir capacity, and quality are the main determinants for the costs of CO 2 storage. Given the large variation in storage costs and the risk of investing in the exploration of deep saline aquifers that are unsuitable, a risk-reward mechanism is needed to realize their significant potential and ensure sufficient storage capacity is available - in the timeframe needed.

TI  - Which option best estimates the above-ground biomass of mangroves of Bangladesh: pantropical or site- and species-specific models?
AB  - Bangladesh has the single largest tract of naturally growing mangrove forest as well as the world's largest manmade mangrove forest on newly accreted land in coastal areas. These mangrove forests provide significant support to the community as sources of renewable resources, shelter from natural calamities, and carbon sinks. The second nationwide forest inventory is now underway in Bangladesh. Biomass and carbon stock assessment of trees and forests is one of the objectives of this inventory. The present study aims to derive multi-species allometric biomass models for the Sundarbans mangrove forests and species-specific allometric biomass models for planted Sonneratia apetala Buch. Ham in the coastal zone of Bangladesh. A total of 342 individuals from 14 tree species from the Sundarbans and 73 individuals of planted S. apetala from the coastal zone were selected for the development and validation of the allometric model. A semi-destructive method was adopted to estimate the biomass of the sample trees. The best fit multi-species allometric model of Total Above-ground Biomass (TAGB) for the Sundarbans zone was Ln (TAGB) = - 6.7189 + 2.1634 {*} Ln(D) + 0.3752 {*} Ln(H) + 0.6895 {*} Ln(W). Moreover, relatively simple models with only DBH or DBH and H as predictive variables are also recommended for the Sundarbans zone. The best fit species-specific allometric model of TAGB for the planted S. apetala was Ln (TAGB) = - 1.7608 + 2.0077 {*} Ln(D) + 0.2981 {*} Ln(H), where D = diameter at breast height in cm, H = total height in m, and W = wood density (kg m(-3)). The derived best fit allometric models of TAGB for the Sundarbans and planted S. apetala were more efficient in biomass estimation than the frequently used regional and pan-tropical allometric models.

These often require downtime of the asset andcan involve risk to human workers who have to be sent to the offshore location. In this work, we presenta non-destructive (NDE) system in conjunction with a robotic platform, which can perform inspectionsof the thickness of a component, for example from the outside of a tank or a pressure vessel. The NDEsystem consists of a digital acquisition system and an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT). TheEMAT generates an acoustic wave, which reflects from the internal features of the component. The wave isreceived by the same device. The received signal is then processed by the acquisition system to determine thethickness of the component. The NDE system is integrated with a robotic platform that can autonomouslyor semi-autonomously perform scans of the asset. The robot platform presented in this work uses sensorfusion, machine vision and state of the art motion planning techniques to build a map of the material qualityin 3D. This is achieved by exploiting the precise movement of the robot end-effector along the surface ofthe asset and then integrating the position of the NDE sensor. The collected data is then presented to theremote operator in a user-friendly way, which allows them to evaluate the state of the asset. We validate thissystem using material samples with known defects. We performed experiments in a controlled environment,and we demonstrate the system in a case study at a testing facility operated by our industrial partners. Â© 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - A novel, flexible porous nanofibrous hydrogel interfacial solar evaporator for highly efficient seawater and wastewater purification
AB  - Solar desalination is recognized as one of the eco-friendly and sustainable ways to alleviate the global freshwater crisis but still requires further research, especially in developing high-performance evaporators. Herein, we prepared an efficient carbon nanotubes (CNTs)@polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibrous hydrogel evaporator by electrospinning and subsequently chemical cross-linking treatment. Due to CNTs with good light absorption capacity, the evaporator exhibited an excellent light absorption capacity (&gt;90%) throughout the full spectrum range (250â€“2500 nm). Meanwhile, the interconnected pores from electrospinning, as well as the intermediate water in the hydrogel, ensured the prepared evaporator with a favorable evaporation rate of up to 2.16 kg mâˆ’2 hâˆ’1 and photothermal conversion efficiency of âˆ¼88.13% under one solar light intensity. For long-term seawater desalination, the CNTs@PVA nanofibrous hydrogel evaporator also presented superior salt resistance, durability and good self-cleaning properties. Besides, various non-volatile pollutants can be completely removed by the prepared evaporator during the wastewater purification. As a result, this work is considered to provide a new direction for developing high-performance evaporators to provide freshwater through seawater desalination and wastewater purification.

TI  - The relationship between POC export efficiency and primary production: Opposite on the shelf and basin of the Northern South China Sea
AB  - Accurate estimation of particulate organic carbon (POC) export efficiency in the euphotic layer is essential to understand the efficiency of the ocean's biological carbon pump, but field measurements are difficult to conduct and data are sparse. In this study, we investigated the relationship between POC sinking export efficiency and ocean net primary production (NPP) in the euphotic layer of the northern South China Sea (NSCS), with the help of high spatiotemporal coverage satellite-derived NPP. Annual mean POC export efficiency in euphotic zone is 34% for the shelf areas and 24% for the basin of the NSCS in the context of satellite-derived 16-day-composited NPP. Similar to what is generally observed in the global ocean, the POC export efficiency on the shelf areas appears to be strengthened with the increase of NPP. However, in the basin areas, the opposite relationship is observed. That is, the POC export efficiency significantly decreases with the increase of NPP. Seasonal decoupling between NPP and POC export, phytoplankton size structure, grazing by zooplankton, and dissolved organic carbon export might account for the observed negative relationship between the POC export efficiency and NPP in the euphotic layer of basin region. System comparison between shelf and basin would be helpful to promote understanding of the regulation mechanism of POC export in the tropical marginal seas. Â© 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Green Pathway of CO2 Capture
AB  - Global warming reaches an average of up to 425Â ppm in May 2020 with an increasing rate of CO2 emissions. The outcome is the melting of icebergs and seriously affected biodiversity. Therefore, demand was raised for the creation of new mitigation approaches to effectively catch it. Developing cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and productive CO2 capture technologies are required. In this chapter, we illustrated alternate green CO2 sequestration routes such as adsorption via, MOFs, green solvent absorption, and biological CO2 conversion method. Unlike biotic sequestration, abiotic sequestration is a method of engineering. It is possible to develop advanced technologies for deep injection into the ocean, geological structures, coal mines, and oil wells, etc. The detailed process and results are discussed in the given chapter.

TI  - A Novel Hybrid Polygeneration System Based on Biomass, Wind and Solar Energy for Micro-Scale Isolated Communities
AB  - The availability of freshwater and energy is a serious issue in remote and islanded areas, especially at a small scale, where there may not be the possibility to access the grid and/or water distribution systems. In this context, polygeneration systems operating on the basis of local, renewable energy sources can be an answer to the users' demand for electricity, heating, cooling, and domestic hot water. The scope of the proposed paper was to investigate, numerically, the energy and economic feasibility of a novel hybrid polygeneration system powered by biomass, solar, and wind energy for a micro-district of households. The proposed system consists of a biomass-fueled steam cycle, wind turbine, photovoltaic field coupled with thermal and electrical energy storage, adsorption chiller, and a reverse osmosis water desalination unit. The system is also assisted by an LPG generator set running as backup. The system provides space heating and cooling, electrical energy, and fresh and domestic hot water to 10 households located on Pantelleria Island, Italy. The proposed system is modelled and simulated through TRNSYS software with realistic user demand. The energy and economic performance of the proposed system are assessed with respect to a reference system in different scenarios, taking into account islanded operation, connection to the grid, and biomass tariffs. The results show that the proposed system achieves an excellent primary energy saving performance in all the investigated scenarios, with savings of more than 94\% for all the investigated scenarios. Excluding any kind of funding, in case of new investment for the system, the simple payback oscillates between 7 and 12 years, showing that the developed alternative is fairly valid with respect to traditional solutions.

TI  - Marine microbial community responses related to wetland carbon mobilization in the coastal zone
AB  - Here, we examine how marine microbial communities respond when dissolved organic matter (DOM) is mobilized from coastal wetlands. Biological transformations of this DOM may increase in the presence of reactive substrates, such as algal-derived DOM (ADOM) in the coastal zonea process known as priming. We performed laboratory experiments examining transformations of DOM derived from coastal wetland peat (PDOM) with and without the presence ADOM. Associated shifts in microbial community composition and functional gene abundance were measured to evaluate mechanisms of priming effects. ADOM presence stimulated CO2 production when compared to the seawater control, which was further enhanced in the copresence of PDOM. DOM characterization showed a substantial difference in features present at the end of the incubation when PDOM was present with and without ADOM, while metagenomic sequencing indicated shifts in microbial community composition and identified 23 unique functional genes associated with pathways for the breakdown of aromatic compounds.

TI  - Intelligent Navigation for a Solar Powered Unmanned Underwater Vehicle
AB  - In this paper, an intelligent navigation system for an unmanned underwater vehicle powered by renewable energy and designed for shadow water inspection in missions of a long duration is proposed. The system is composed of an underwater vehicle, which tows a surface vehicle. The surface vehicle is a small boat with photovoltaic panels, a methanol fuel cell and communication equipment, which provides energy and communication to the underwater vehicle. The underwater vehicle has sensors to monitor the underwater environment such as sidescan sonar and a video camera in a flexible configuration and sensors to measure the physical and chemical parameters of water quality on predefined paths for long distances. The underwater vehicle implements a biologically inspired neural architecture for autonomous intelligent navigation. Navigation is carried out by integrating a kinematic adaptive neuro-controller for trajectory tracking and an obstacle avoidance adaptive neuro-controller. The autonomous underwater vehicle is capable of operating during long periods of observation and monitoring. This autonomous vehicle is a good tool for observing large areas of sea, since it operates for long periods of time due to the contribution of renewable energy. It correlates all sensor data for time and geodetic position. This vehicle has been used for monitoring the Mar Menor lagoon.

TI  - Jack-up site assessment - The voyage to an ISO
AB  - As a mobile offshore unit, a jack-up can float, self-elevate and then impose proofing loads on the seabed to establish a safe working envelope for subsequent drilling or construction activities. Jack-up site assessment has seen significant advances over the 50 or more years that jack-ups have been deployed offshore. The advances have occurred as a result of both the improvements that have been seen in the analytical tools and also as a result of the many significant strides in our understanding of the physics of the jack-up and the ocean environment. Jack-ups, due to their semi-compliant nature, pose particularly difficult challenges to the designer and operator - more so than most offshore structures. This requires cutting edge technologies to assure that practical solutions can be reached without either too much conservatism or too little safety. These advances have often occurred, or been encouraged, as a result of the engagement of the operators hiring the jack-ups and their technical overseers such as Jan Vugts. Jan was instrumental in initiating the Shell study into jack-up site assessment that resulted in a follow-up JIP which developed the SNAME Recommend Practice. Since then ISO 19905-1 has been under development and Jan has provided both encouragement and also very detailed review comments. This paper charts the voyage from the early days of jack-up site assessment through to the development of the ISO and highlights some of the key technical developments. Copyright Â© 2011 by ASME.

TI  - Dual-Function Materials for CO2Capture and Conversion: A Review
AB  - Anthropogenic emissions of CO2 from industrial processes are considered the major cause of global warming and ocean acidification. To this end, different abatement strategies have been sought to capture CO2 directly from various effluent sources. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has been touted to solve this problem; however, due to the challenges associated with this approach, research efforts have been focused on the development of dual-function materials (DFMs) that can effectively capture and convert CO2 to value-added products. In this review, we first describe existent CO2 capture processes, followed by relevant CO2 adsorbents. Then, we focus on the development of DFMs for CO2 capture and conversion through various reaction pathways, such as methanation, reverse water-gas shift, and dry reforming. We also elaborate on the challenges associated with these systems with emphasis on the stability and regenerability of the materials. Finally, some future perspectives and possible areas of study are highlighted. Â© 2020 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Economic evaluation of CO2 liquefaction processes for ship-based Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) chain
AB  - This study evaluated process options for CO2 liquefaction for ship-based Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and determined the optimal process. Two types of liquefaction processes, an open cycle and a closed cycle, were suggested. CO2 is compressed and expanded as the refrigerant in open cycle, while closed cycle utilizes external refrigerants to liquefy CO 2. Design variables, such as pressure and temperature, were optimized for each liquefaction process. Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis was utilized for the evaluation of the candidate processes. CAPEX (Capital Expenditure) and OPEX (Operational Expenditure) were taken into account in the LCC. Copyright Â© 2014 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).

TI  - Analysis of wind to hydrogen production and carbon capture utilisation and storage systems for novel production of chemical energy carriers
AB  - As the offshore energy landscape transitions to renewable energy useful decommissioned or abandoned oil and gas infrastructure can be repurposed in the context of the circular economy. Oil and gas platforms, for example, offer opportunity for hydrogen (H-2) production by desalination and electrolysis of sea water using offshore wind power. However, as H-2 storage and transport may prove challenging this study proposes to react this H2 with the carbon dioxide (CO2) stored in depleted reservoirs. Thus, producing a more transportable energy carriers like methane or methanol in the reservoir. This paper presents a novel thermodynamic analysis of the Goldeneye reservoir in the North Sea in Aspen Plus. For Goldeneye, which can store 30 Mt of CO2 at full capacity, if connected to a 4.45 GW wind farm, it has the potential to produce 2.10 Mt of methane annually and abate 4.51 Mt of CO2 from wind energy in the grid.

The article focuses on the use of a turbocharger that comprises an overexpansion turbine, heat exchanger, and booster compressor. An increase in the effective efficiency over a broad range of engine operating conditions is established based on a study of a GTE of the proposed design. It is shown that a GTE with turbo-compressor exhaust system is able to generate thermal energy in significant volumes and is a cogeneration-type power plant that functions with high thermal efficiency.

TI  - Selecting Reliable and Robust Freshwater Macroalgae for Biomass Applications
AB  - Intensive cultivation of freshwater macroalgae is likely to increase with the development of an algal biofuels industry and algal bioremediation. However, target freshwater macroalgae species suitable for large-scale intensive cultivation have not yet been identified. Therefore, as a first step to identifying target species, we compared the productivity, growth and biochemical composition of three species representative of key freshwater macroalgae genera across a range of cultivation conditions. We then selected a primary target species and assessed its competitive ability against other species over a range of stocking densities. Oedogonium had the highest productivity (8.0 g ash free dry weight m(-2) day(-1)), lowest ash content (3-8\%), lowest water content (fresh weigh: dry weight ratio of 3.4), highest carbon content (45\%) and highest bioenergy potential (higher heating value 20 MJ/kg) compared to Cladophora and Spirogyra. The higher productivity of Oedogonium relative to Cladophora and Spirogyra was consistent when algae were cultured with and without the addition of CO2 across three aeration treatments. Therefore, Oedogonium was selected as our primary target species. The competitive ability of Oedogonium was assessed by growing it in bi-cultures and polycultures with Cladophora and Spirogyra over a range of stocking densities. Cultures were initially stocked with equal proportions of each species, but after three weeks of growth the proportion of Oedogonium had increased to at least 96\% (+/- 7 S.E.) in Oedogonium-Spirogyra bi-cultures, 86\% (+/- 16 S.E.) in Oedogonium-Cladophora bi-cultures and 82\% (+/- 18 S.E.) in polycultures. The high productivity, bioenergy potential and competitive dominance of Oedogonium make this species an ideal freshwater macroalgal target for large-scale production and a valuable biomass source for bioenergy applications. These results demonstrate that freshwater macroalgae are thus far an under-utilised feedstock with much potential for biomass applications.

TI  - Zero-fossil-energy powered infrastructure and buildings on Catalina Island in Southern California
AB  - Buildings, infrastructure, and the landscape in which they are situated are inextricably linked. Energy, materials, water and land are all consumed in the development and operation of buildings and infrastructures on Catalina Island, while the built environment itself affects the live/work conditions, health, ecology and the economy on Catalina Island in Southern California. This research paper presents excerpts of the ongoing 194.19 km(2) large infrastructure assessment, and sustainable near-term action plan for the Island of Catalina. It evaluates the typologies of infrastructures and buildings on Catalina Island, and proposes the implementation of energy efficiency retrofitting, off-grid scenarios, and sustainability design strategies for two selected large-scale climate sensitive projects. These two design examples are presented as models for future development that could more serve as a concrete signal of an incentive for successfully protected and enhanced natural environments through ecologically designed buildings for the Santa Catalina Island community. These projects incorporate elements that emphasize the re-emerging role of the landscape as infrastructure and as the basis for passive design strategies that support resource efficient alignment of new buildings on the island.

TI  - Life cycle assessment of a seaweed-based biorefinery concept for production of food, materials, and energy
AB  - Blue Economy is seen as an essential contributor to a sustainable development, and it is an important part of the EU Green Deal. Seaweed plays a key role in the Blue Economy as a source of food, feed, and feedstock for biorefineries. Today, the largest part of global seaweed production is based in Asia, but there is also a growing interest in seaweed production in Europe. However, more knowledge on the environmental impacts is needed to ensure sustainable growth of the sector. Seaweed can be used in biorefineries to produce a variety of products for food and non-food applications. The aim of this paper was to perform a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a seaweed value-chain, including seaweed cultivation and production into sodium alginate, biodegradable materials, biogas, and fertilizer in a biorefinery setting. The LCA included 19 environmental impact categories but focused on climate change. The seaweed Saccharina latissima was cultivated and processed in Ireland. Sodium alginate was then extracted by means of ultrasound-assisted extraction, a novel extraction technology. Cellulosic residues produced after the extraction were used for the production of films used as a packaging material. Residues that remain after the production of the films were sent to anaerobic digestion to achieve a no-waste concept. For seaweed cultivation, fuel use and drying of seaweed biomass were the main environmental hot spots; and for the alginate extraction process, the yield and purification after extraction were the main hot spots. Overall, the results of this paper showed that the seaweed-based biorefinery has the potential to be sustainable, but several improvements are necessary before it is competitive with land-based systems.

TI  - Energy-optimal path planning of autonomous underwater vehicles using adaptive flow models
AB  - AUVs are an important tool for mapping and understanding the ocean. Expensive and time consuming launch and recovery operations coupled with relatively short deployments limit the effectiveness of current AUVs. Energy-optimal path planning utilizing ocean currents is one way to extend the mission duration of AUVs. Modern AUVs can utilize onboard flow sensing abilities to measure ocean currents at their location. In this paper, an adaptive planner utilizing proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) for flow modeling is introduced. The conventional planner uses a fixed number of basis functions or modes, which can vary between missions. The proposed planner adapts the flow model throughout a mission based on measurements gathered during transit, making the algorithm robust over different flow domains. A case study is carried out on a 40times 40 km flow field with an AUV model, where the proposed planner is compared to the average, best, and worst performance of the conventional planner using different numbers of modes. The comparison is made in ten areas of different flow patterns. The proposed model adaptive planner outperforms the average energy consumption of the conventional planner in 8 of the 10 domains. It outperforms the worst energy result of the conventional planner in all 10 domains. Â© 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Environmental balance of shipping emissions reduction strategies
AB  - Maritime shipping is regarded as the most efficient mode of transport; however, its contribution to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and the health issues related to shipping activity near residential centers cannot be neglected. In recent years, the efforts of regulators, ship operators, and port authorities have led to actions for ship emissions reduction to improve shipping's environmental performance. This work builds on an activity-based methodology that allows the estimation of emissions and examines environmental effects of slow steaming, fuel regulations, near-port speed-reduction schemes, and cold ironing. Pollutant emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and black carbon are modeled. A linear programming model minimizes fuel consumption through speed differentiation on a shipping line's routes based on fuel costs and binding regulations in each segment of the journey. Although the examined emissions-reduction actions may have a positive regional environmental effect by cutting emissions, it Is possible that additional emissions arc generated elsewhere because of increased sailing speeds beyond regulated areas. Trade-offs between pollutants are observed for reduction actions that may have a positive effect on some emission species but at the same time result in additional particulate matter and black carbon emissions. The presented framework allows key actors to conduct comprehensive studies and design improved emissions reduction actions with fewer negative impacts in other areas.

TI  - Manganese-rich pellets in Green Bay, an exploitable mineral resource of the Great Lakes
AB  - Based on the detailed study of 600 grab samples and cores collected in Green Bay, an arm of Lake Michigan, the presence of a major underwater mineral resource of manganese has been established. The manganese occurs combined with iron in pellets, the majority of which range in size from 0.1 inch to 0.6 inch in diameter. While in some areas as much as 307 of the very fine sand fraction is composed of micro-nodules, the very small sizes are usually present in only limited amounts. Manganese content of the pellets, as determined by neutron activation, varies between 1.0% and 25%, with the average for most samples being slightly over 10%. The major areas of Mn-rich pellets are in the central part of Green Bay, principally offshore from Marinette, Wisconsin, and in the Sturgeon Bay area. Over 200 square miles of bay bottom with abundant manganese pellets have been charted in detail, and current efforts are being made to test the depth of mineralization by core drilling. While over most of the area the pellets are devoid of other metals in other than trace amounts, in two areas totaling some 25 square miles, the copper content of the pellets is noticeably high, ranging between 0.5 and 2.0% by weight. The in situ genesis of the manganese pellets is being studied using trace element, pÃ©trographie, and electron probe methods, as well as certain water chemistry data. Conclusions at this time suggest that a major mineral resource of manganese, and to a lesser extent copper, is available in exploitable amounts beneath Green Bay, a feature further enhanced by shallow dredging depths, easy separation, local ore loading docks, and nearby markets.

TI  - Trend analysis of domestic and international regulations for electric propulsion system
AB  - While regulations are being strengthened to prevent air pollution from ships in Korea and other countries, the Korean government has passed the Eco-Friendly Ship Act, which is effective from 1 January 2020. Therefore, for coastal ships constructed in Korea, the emission of air pollutants should be reduced by alternative fuel and improving their propulsion system. Accordingly, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries in Korea has announced a plan to promote the conversion of all 140 government ships into eco-friendly ships using liquefied natural gas or electric propulsion systems by 2030. To apply these propulsion systems, rules, and regulations of the Korea government must first be reorganized. In this study, the type and development trend of electric propulsion systems are reviewed, and trends in regulations for installing electric propulsion systems on ships in various countries, including the United States and Europe, and institutions, including the IEC, IEEE, and International Maritime Organization, are analyzed. Finally, the standardization of the regulation system is discussed to facilitate the introduction of eco-friendly ships to Korea, and relevant implications will be presented. Â© 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Factors influencing the distribution of organic carbon in four different coastal sedimentary environments
AB  - Purpose: Organic carbon (OC) plays an important role in the multimedium transport of pollutants and the carbon cycle. However, the distribution and fate of OC in coastal areas with multiple sedimentary environments, especially in underdeveloped coastal areas, have been underappreciated and lacked sufficient understanding. Materials and methods: In this paper, the characteristics and fate of OC in four sedimentary environments (mangrove, sandy coast, bay, and estuary) in a coastal area in Guangdong, China, were compared. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and suspended sediment (SPS) concentrations in water phases as well as total organic carbon (TOC) content and grain size distribution in sediments were determined. Results and discussion: The DOC concentrations and TOC contents were 0.006â€“13.66Â mg Lâˆ’1 and 0.04â€“9.51%, respectively, indicating a large spatial heterogeneity. The DOC levels showed an increasing trend into the bays and a decreasing trend along the estuaries, relating to hydrodynamic conditions for OC transport. The SPS concentrations were positively correlated with the TOC/DOC ratios in estuaries, confirming the carrier role of SPS in waterâ€“sediment systems. No significant differences in DOC concentrations were found under different water column depths, inferring that waterâ€“sediment ratios were not a limiting factor for DOC levels. The actual OC storage of the whole mangrove sedimentary environment was underestimated by 18.2% when calculated using the OC levels of the largest mangrove. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the OC storage estimation in multiple sedimentary environments could be underestimated. This study provides new insight for management and protection of coastline eco-environments and the estimation of carbon stock in the hopes of adapting to climate change.

TI  - Financial Bailout Spending Would Have Almost Paid for Thirty Years of Global Green New Deal Climate: Triage, Regeneration, and Mitigation
AB  - Human-induced climate crisis is destroying the capacity of our planet to support our species and other life at an unprecedented rate. The most urgent of climate crisis tipping points is Arctic warming and sea ice loss. It is estimated that Arctic summer sea ice loss, that could-based on current trends-occur in one or two decades, would cause an abrupt 0.5 Watts per square meter increase in global warming above preindustrial levels that would be roughly equivalent to the effect of more than seventeen years of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions if it occurred today. A Global Green New Deal (GGND) will require at least three phases and three funding sources. The three overlapping phases are (a) short-run climate restoration or triage, (b) medium-term soil carbon sponge and water cycle adaptation or regeneration, and (c) long-run GHG drawdown or mitigation. The three funding sources are (a) utilizing the sovereign of the US government and Federal Reserve to create dollars, (b) taxing GHG emissions, and (c) taxing wealthy and high-income individuals with a particular focus on rentiers. The ex-nihilo financial support offered by the Fed to bail out the global financial system from 2008 to 2011 would have been almost sufficient to fund a 2020-2050 comprehensive GGND that includes all of the components above.

AB  - Summit Power Group has entered into an agreement with UK's National Grid and Petrofac to seek funding for development in the UK of a low-carbon power plant, including full-chain, commercial-scale carbon capture and storage. The Caledonia Clean Energy Project will be submitted to the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change for funding under the UK's Carbon Capture &amp; Storage Delivery Competition. Along with &gt; 90% carbon capture, the coal feedstock plant will also produce hydrogen gas for commercial use. The CO2 will be transported via pipeline to St. Fergus by National Grid Carbon and then transferred offshore for geological sequestration deep under the North Sea by Petrofac subsidiary CO2 DeepStore.

TI  - An analysis of the disposal of anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean via a submerged hydrate crystallizer
AB  - A new scenario for disposal of the anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean is proposed. In this scenario, liquid CO2 is injected through a submerged pipeline into a crystallizer located at a depth between 450 and 500 m in the ocean, where the injected liquid CO2 is converted completely into hydrate particles via a crystallization process and then the hydrate particles are released into the ocean. Because of being heavier than seawater, the hydrate particles will sink and will be sequestrated in the ocean. This proposed scenario has been simulated experimentally and the simulation results, including the effect of agitation on the formation process of CO2 hydrate particles, are reported in this study.

TI  - Development of offshore drilling platform simulation for virtual onboard experience
AB  - As marine resources have been actively explored, a large number of offshore drilling platforms such as drillships and semi-submersible rigs have been built in many shipyards. The drilling system is the key feature that defines the characteristics of the platform. The operation of the drilling system is usually focused on the tubular handling, hoisting, and rotating systems which are directly handling drilling pipes and risers on the drill floor. Therefore, most of the training simulators have been developed only for controlling the drilling equipment. However, not only the drilling equipment handling on the drill floor, but also compensations systems such as heave compensation system and DPS (Dynamic Positioning System) to reduce the effect of the motion, ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) operation, well control including BOP (Blow-Out Preventer) should be integrated systematically because these systems on the offshore drilling platform are operated at the same time. Therefore, we propose the integrated offshore drilling platform simulation for virtual onboard experience which is composed of a virtual driller's cabin for handling drilling equipment, well control simulator to remove a kick, DPS simulator to control the motion of the platform, walk-through simulator to monitor the operation from the worker's viewpoint on the platform, and dynamic analyses of heave compensation system. All data such as the movement of the drilling equipment, platform position, driller's command, etc. are shared among systems in real-time. The proposed virtual offshore drilling platform can effectively show the various situations that occur during drilling operations. Â© 2022

TI  - Ship-based carbon capture onboard of diesel or LNG-fuelled ships
AB  - Total shipping carbon emissions were approximately 938 million tonnes CO2 in 2012. Zero emission shipping options rely on the use of electricity or alternative fuels, such as blue hydrogen or ammonia. However, that requires major modifications to the ships and the logistics of fuel distribution. As a transition solution, which can be implemented on much shorter term; this study presents the technical and economic evaluation for ship-based carbon capture (SBCC) on diesel or LNG-fuelled vessels. Two reference ship engines of 1280 kW and 3000 kW were chosen. The process is simulated using Aspen PlusÂ®, with 30 wt% aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) and 30 wt% aqueous piperazine (PZ) as solvents. CAPEX and OPEX were reduced by integrating the thermal energy of the exhaust gas with the stripper reboiler for the diesel and LNG powered ships. For the LNG ships, the cooling capacity from evaporation of LNG was used for liquefying the captured CO2. By using piperazine, which allows CO2 to be desorbed at higher pressure than MEA, the minimal cost of CO2 captured achieved was 98 â‚¬/tonne CO2 with a corresponding 1.8 million euros equipment cost for the 3000 kW engine ship. Additionally, the feasibility of SBCC is investigated by adapting an existing cargo ship design (powered by the reference 3000 kW engine) for including the carbon capture process equipment. The capture, compression and storage units are fitted onboard, and the design is modified so that the transport capacity remains the same, while maintaining the ship stability. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Adaptive Power Control Aware Depth Routing in Underwater Sensor Networks
AB  - Underwater acoustic sensor network (UASN) refers to a pro-cedure that promotes a broad spectrum of aquatic applications. UASNs can be practically applied in seismic checking, ocean mine identification, resource exploration, pollution checking, and disaster avoidance. UASN confronts many difficulties and issues, such as low bandwidth, node move-ments, propagation delay, 3D arrangement, energy limitation, and high-cost production and arrangement costs caused by antagonistic underwater sit-uations. Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) are considered a major issue being encountered in energy management because of the limited battery power of their nodes. Moreover, the harsh underwater environment requires vendors to design and deploy energy-hungry devices to fulfil the communication requirements and maintain an acceptable quality of service. Moreover, increased transmission power levels result in higher channel inter-ference, thereby increasing packet loss. Considering the facts mentioned above, this research presents a controlled transmission power-based sparsity-aware energy-efficient clustering in UWSNs. The contributions of this technique is threefold. First, it uses the adaptive power control mechanism to utilize the sensor nodes' battery and reduce channel interference effectively. Second, thresholds are defined to ensure successful communication. Third, clustering can be implemented in dense areas to decrease the repetitive transmission that ultimately affects the energy consumption of nodes and interference significantly. Additionally, mobile sinks are deployed to gather information locally to achieve the previously mentioned benefits. The suggested protocol is meticulously examined through extensive simulations and is validated through comparison with other advanced UWSN strategies. Findings show that the suggested protocol outperforms other procedures in terms of network lifetime and packet delivery ratio.

TI  - Modeling of an underwater drilling platform for very near shore applications
AB  - The development of the blue economy involves the construction of marine infrastructures (harbors, marine wind farms, underwater data centers, etc.). All these activities require a geological investigation of the sea bottom. For nearshore and very near-shore applications the most common solution is represented by the adoption of fixed jack-up platforms; however, transportation and deployment of this kind of infrastructure are quite expensive and time-consuming. Also, the adoption of floating drilling technologies that are currently used for offshore applications is often difficult or impossible in shallow waters. In this work, an underwater drilling platform designed for near-shore applications is investigated. The proposed system is designed and optimized for rapid deployment in different operational conditions. This work is focused on the description of this innovative solution including simulation models that have been developed for this activity. Also, simulation models represent an original contribution because they are able to simulate complex interactions of the drilling pod with the surrounding water, with the support ship and with the excavated sea bottom.

TI  - Assessing the efficiency and eco-sustainability of bioremediation strategies for the reclamation of highly contaminated marine sediments
AB  - Coastal sediments subjected to high anthropogenic impacts can accumulate large amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals, demanding effective and eco-sustainable remediation solutions. In this study, we carried out bioremediation experiments on marine sediments highly contaminated with PAHs and metals. In particular, we investigated the effects of biostimulation (by the addition of inorganic nutrients), bioaugmentation (by the addition of fungi belonging to Aspergillus sp.) and microbial fuel cell-based strategies on PAH degradation and on changes in metal partitioning. Results reported here indicate that all biotreatments determined a significant decrease of PAH concentrations (at least 60\%) in a relatively short time interval (few weeks) and that biostimulation was the most effective approach (>90\%). Biostimulation determined a faster degradation rate of high than low molecular weight PAHs, indicating a preferential biodegradation of specific PAH congeners. At the same time, the biotreatments changed the partitioning of metals, including their solubilization, suggesting the need of parallel environmental risk assessment. Our findings also suggest that ex situ biotreatments can have a lower carbon footprint than current management options of contaminated sediments (i.e., landfill disposal and/or disposal in confined aquatic facilities), but integration with other strategies for metal removal (e.g. through bioleaching) from sediments is needed for their safe re-use. Overall, results presented here provide new insights into the development of effective and eco-sustainable bioremediation strategies for the reclamation of highly contaminated marine sediments.

TI  - Software application based on subsea engineering design codes
AB  - Development of software application for subsea engineering design and analysis is to a large extent based on codes and standards used in the offshore industry when considering subsea pipelines. In this paper a software is described which main purpose is to facilitate the design and analysis process and such that results and documentation are automatically generated to increase quality of documentation. Current scope is a standard calculation tool covering different aspects of design in compliance with relevant offshore codes. A modularization technique is used to divide the software system into multiple discrete and independent modules based on offshore codes, which are capable of carrying out task(s) independently. All modules in range operate from a project model that is accessed directly by other modules for analysis and performance prediction and allows design changes to flow through automatically to facilitate smooth communication and coordination between different design activities. All the modules have a number of common design features. The quality of an implementation of each offshore code in independent software modules is measured by defining the level of inter-dependability among modules and their interaction among them, and by defining the degree of intra-dependability within elements of a module. This modularization technique also includes other benefits, such as ease of maintenance and updates. The improvements are related to the objectives of a state-of-the-art procedure of performing engineering, design and analysis by use of offshore codes implemented in a software application. The application is developed in.NET C# language with MS Visual Studio Technology that provides a powerful graphical user interface well integrated in windows environment. Copyright Â© 2020 ASME

TI  - Defining a biogeochemical baseline for sediments at Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) sites: An example from the North Sea (Goldeneye)
AB  - Injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) into subseafloor reservoirs is gaining traction as a strategy for mitigating anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Yet, potential leakage, migration and dissolution of externally-supplied CO2 from such reservoirs are a cause for concern. The potential impact of CO2 leakage on the biogeochemistry of sediments and overlying waters in the North Sea was studied during a controlled subsurface CO2 release experiment in 2019 at a potential carbon capture and storage site (Goldeneye). This study describes the natural (unperturbed) biogeochemistry of sediments. They are classified as muddy sand to sandy mud with low organic carbon content (âˆ¼0.6 %). Distributions of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) in sediment porewaters are reported in addition to in situ benthic fluxes of dissolved nutrients and oxygen between the sediments and the overlying water. Oxygen fluxes into the sediment, measured using benthic chambers and eddy covariance, were 6.18 Â± 0.58 and 5.73 Â± 2.03 mmol mâˆ’2 d-1, respectively. Diagnostic indicators are discussed that could be used to detect CO2 enrichment of sediments due to reservoir leakage at CCS sites. These include the ratio TA and ammonium to sulfate in sediment porewaters, benthic fluxes and chloride-normalized cation distributions. These indicators currently suggest that the organic carbon at Goldeneye has an oxidation state below zero and is mainly degraded via sulfate reduction. Carbonate precipitation is apparently negligible, whereas decreases in Mg2+ and K+ point toward ongoing alteration of lithogenic sediments by reverse weathering processes. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Carbon stocks of mangroves within the Zambezi River Delta, Mozambique
AB  - Mangroves are well-known for their numerous ecosystem services, including storing a globally significant C pool. There is increasing interest in the inclusion of mangroves in national climate change mitigation and adaptation plans in developing nations as they become involved with incentive programs for climate change mitigation. The quality and precision of data required by these programs necessitates the use of an inventory approach that allows for quantification, rather than general characterization, of C stocks. In this study, we quantified the ecosystem C stock of the Zambezi River Delta mangroves utilizing a rigorous, yet operationally feasible approach. We applied a stratified random sampling inventory design, based on five forest canopy height classes, derived from Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (ICE Sat/GLAS) and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data, and a Spatial Decision Support System to allocate inventory plots. Carbon content in above- and below-ground biomass pools in addition to soils to a depth of 200cm was measured. The average biomass C density for the height classes ranged from 99.2MgCha-1 to 341.3MgCha-1. Soil C density was the largest measured C pool, containing 274.6MgCha-1 to 314.1MgCha-1 and accounting for 45-73% of the height class ecosystem C densities, which ranged from 373.8MgCha-1 to 620.8MgCha-1. The ecosystem C density estimates for the five strata were weighted based on their spatial distribution across the landscape to yield a total C stock for the Zambezi River Delta mangroves of 1.4Ã—107MgC. The error bounds from the 95% confidence interval are Â±6% of our ecosystem C stock estimate, well within acceptable levels of uncertainty. Â© 2015.

TI  - Testing an artificial beach system for removal of pollution in a coastal zone
AB  - The developmental activities and utilizations of Japanese coastal seas have been increased recently. Consequently, the production of coastal fisheries, especially of those in enclosed seas, are considerably affected by artificial impacts such as reclamation from the sea and increased pollution load. The objective of this paper is to propose a new ecotechnological method to recover the polluted coastal environment by using an artificial beach system. An artificial beach (5 m x 10 m) was constructed in the Matsushima Bay facing the Pacific Sea, about 300 km northeast from Tokyo. The area was polluted by fishery production and untreated wastewaters from rural district. The major merits of this system are simplicity of the structure, energy-free operation, capability to use tidal current cycle effectively, and ease of maintenance. The results of field investigation indicated that rapid removals of turbidity, suspended solids, phosphorus and ammonium nitrogen by the artificial beach system were achieved. The removal rate of total organic carbon was high because of the retention of the particulate matters. These performances were related to physical and biological filtration through the artificial beach system. It suggests that restoration of polluted coastal area may be expected using this artificial beach system.

TI  - Exhaust gas driven generator with altitude compensation for battery dominant hybrid electric vehicles
AB  - HEVs historically have had reduced performance at elevations higher than sea level. The effects of this loss of performance can be mediated with the use of a standard turbocharger; however, approximately 80-90% of the vehicle's operation is at altitudes where full boost from the turbocharger is not needed to maintain performance characteristics comparable to conventional vehicles of the same size. If the turbocharger is used to drive an electric generator, the power produced by the turbine section that is not needed to maintain the intake pressure at the set point, determined as the pressure at which the best ICE efficiency occurs, can be used to charge the traction battery of HEVs. The Exhaust Gas Driven Generator converts the thermal energy, normally wasted through the exhaust of the ICE, to electrical energy stored in the traction battery of the HEV. By recovering a portion of the heat energy of the exhausted combustion gases, the Exhaust Gas Driven Generator can improve the volumetric efficiency and effective thermal efficiency of the propulsion system of the HEV, thus reducing the fuel consumption of the typical HEV even further.

TI  - COMPARISON OF RESIDUAL OIL SATURATION FOR WATER AND SUPERCRITICAL CO2 FLOODING IN A LONG CORE, WITH LIVE OIL AT RESERVOIR CONDITIONS
AB  - The measurement of residual oil saturation (ROS) is of paramount importance in predicting the expected recovery in a producing field. It is also a key factor for reservoir management and for defining possible long-term enhanced oil recovery (EOR) targets. Even though ROS has been known to depend on different factors, such dependence has not been investigated extensively in the laboratory, at reservoir conditions. This paper describes an experimental work focusing on the rock formation and conditions of a very highly productive field that is offshore Brazil. The objective was to compare the recovery efficiency between water and supercritical CO2 flooding at reservoir conditions in terms of ROS evolution. A careful program of displacement tests was conducted using long real unconsolidated porous media and live reservoir fluid at reservoir pressure and temperature. An improved version of a conventional test apparatus has been implemented successfully to allow high pressure displacements through long cores. A linear x-ray monitoring device permitted us to follow water and CO2 in situ saturations along the core. A numerical simulation study was developed to scrutinize possible effects from varying conditions. The results obtained in this work led to lower residual oil saturation in the CO2 flooding than water flooding. Experimental and numerical simulation results are compared.

TI  - An empirical analysis on the operational profile of liquefied natural gas carriers with steam propulsion plants
AB  - Liquefied natural gas (LNG) offers negligible NOx and SOx emissions as well as reductions in CO2 compared with other liquid hydrocarbons. LNG is a significant player in the global energy mix, with a projection of 40\% increase in demand for the next two decades. It is anticipated that the expected rise in demand will cause the fleet of LNG carriers (LNGC) to expand. This work concentrates on steam-powered LNGC, which accounted for 47\% of the LNGC fleet in 2018. It performs an empirical analysis of continuous monitoring data that provide high levels of accuracy and transparency. The analysis is done on data collected from 40 LNGCs for over a year to estimate the fleet's operational profile, fuel mix and energy performance. The findings of this work are relevant for bottom-up analysis and simulation models that depend on technical assumptions, but also for emission studies such as the upcoming Fourth International Maritime Organization Greenhouse Gases study.

TI  - Initial assessment of the potential for future CCUS with EOR projects in mexico using CO2 captured from fossil fuel industrial plants
AB  - The Gulf of Mexico region (GMR) comprises the largest industrial CO2 emissions in Mexico and the location of large Mexican oil fields. The recent 2012 version of the North America Carbon Storage Atlas includes the Mexican perspective for geological storage of anthropogenic CO2 and recommends large areas found in the GMR for these purposes. The Mexican State company PetrÃ³leos Mexicanos (PEMEX) is interested in using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations and has informed that large demands of CO2 (up to 50million tons of CO2 per year) are necessary to complete their plans in the near future. The Utility State Company, ComisiÃ³n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), runs several fossil fuel power plants (i.e. natural gas and fuel oil) in areas nearby PEMEX oil fields that are candidates for EOR. In addition, Mexico launched its climate change law during 2012 that will enforce the reduction of its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, targeting between 30% and 50% reduction of its emissions in 2000 by 2020 and 2050 respectively. The present work describes positive conditions existing in the GMR for future EOR-CCS projects implemented in Mexico. There is not published work in the literature regarding matching potential Mexican industrial CO2 sources and CO2-demanding oil fields to the knowledge of the authors. Some of these positive facts are the proximity between CFE power plants (CO2 source) and the PEMEX oil fields (CO2 receptor), large demand for CO2 for EOR plans, large amounts of CO2 emitted by CFE power plants, important GHG emission sources located in the GMR and the necessity of reducing national GHG emission rates in the country. It is observed that the GMR has conditions that may motivate future EOR-CCS projects in Mexico; however, due to the actual high cost of CO2 capture technologies and the large CO2 demanded by PEMEX, these projects could be undertaken only with extra financial support from the Government of Mexico and based on expecting economic benefits from the selling of the oil recovered through EOR.

TI  - Renewable energy and the public: From NIMBY to participation
AB  - Throughout the world, the threat of climate change is pressing governments to accelerate the deployment of technologies to generate low carbon electricity or heat. But this is frequently leading to controversy, as energy and planning policies are revised to support new energy sources or technologies (e.g. offshore wind, tidal, bioenergy or hydrogen energy) and communities face the prospect of unfamiliar, often large-scale energy technologies being sited near to their homes. Policy makers in many countries face tensions between 'streamlining' planning procedures, engaging with diverse publics to address what is commonly conceived as 'NIMBY' (not in my back yard) opposition, and the need to maintain democratic, participatory values in planning systems. This volume provides a timely, international review of research on public engagement, in contexts of diverse, innovative energy technologies. Public engagement is conceived broadly - as the interaction between how developers and other key actors engage with publics about energy technologies (including assumptions held about the methods used, such as the provision of financial benefits or the holding of deliberative events), and how individuals and groups engage with energy policies and projects (including indirectly through the media and directly through emotional and behavioural responses). The book's contributors are leading experts in the UK, Europe, North and South America and Australia drawn from a variety of relevant social science disciplinary perspectives. The book makes a significant contribution to our existing knowledge, as well as providing interested professionals, policymakers and members of the public with a timely overview of the critical issues involved in public engagement with low carbon energy technologies.

TI  - Ocean disposal of CO2 in the North Pacific Ocean: Assessment of CO2 chemistry and circulation on storage and return to the atmosphere
AB  - The purpose of this study is to assess changes in the ocean biogeochemistry and oceanic partial of CO2 (pCO2) due to CO2 disposal and its effects, and to discuss the oceanographic parameters affecting the return of disposed CO2 back to the atmosphere. The primary focus will be on CO2 scenarios for North Pacific intermediate water (NPIW) and the deep water off the Japanese coast. CO2 chemistry shows that pCO2 values in the intermediate and deep North Pacific waters are already higher than the present atmospheric CO2 level. The factors maintaining high pCO2 in the waters of the North Pacific Ocean are (1) ocean diffusivity, (2) penetration and mixing into deeper water, (3) transport of NPIW, (4) deep Pacific circulation, and (5) the efficiency of the biological pump. Review of recent work on ventilation of deep Pacific waters suggests a mid-depth return flow to Antarctic circumpolar water, increasing the residence time of disposed CO2 into the deep water. A review of CO2 source and sink areas in the Pacific Ocean indicates potential escape routes of disposed CO2 back to the atmosphere. Several strategies are available for disposing CO2 into the ocean: (1) Disposal into the upper ocean can be combined with simultaneous fertilization to create a detritus flux, transporting CO2 into deep water. (2) Disposal into NP1W will buy 20 to 50 years of time depending on the maintaining of the ventilation rate of NP1W. (3) Disposal into the deep Pacific waters relies on the tightness of the thermocline lid and the continuous action of the biological pump to keep the upper ocean ocean low in pCO2. Thus, certain crucial areas of research need to be looked at to remove uncertainties in knowledge such as (a) the experimental assessment of vertical diffusivity (K(v)) in the upper, the intermediate and deep waters, (b) an assessment of the time-scale of Pacific ventilation, and (c) fertilization to enhance the biological pump. A Pacific SF6 tracer and CO2 storage experiment is a logical approach to tackle these important areas of research.

TI  - Average and wave-by-wave overtopping performance of steep low-crested structures
AB  - Wave overtopping is a key process in coastal protection. The assessment of the wave overtopping rates is an important aspect in the design of coastal structures. In this paper, the focus is on steep low-crested structures, which include structures with steep slopes up to the limit case with vertical structures, with small relative freeboards up to the case with zero freeboards. This type of structures is of use for coastal protection in the case of sea level rise within climate change process and for overtopping wave energy converters. A literature review of the overtopping knowledge available for steep low-crested structures is carried out, identifying a knowledge gap. To fill this knowledge gap, 2D hydraulic model tests were performed at the wave flume of the Department of Civil Engineering at Ghent University, measuring wave conditions and the overtopping performance. Average and individual wave overtopping were analysed and compared to existing prediction formulae. Inaccuracies in the existing prediction formulae are detected and studied, and enhanced prediction formulae are presented for the average overtopping and the probability distribution of the individual overtopping volumes. The new prediction formulae improve the accuracy of wave overtopping volumes for steep low-crested structures range while maintaining the accuracy for other types of structures. The improved understanding of the overtopping behaviour allows a safer design of coastal structures. Â© 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). All rights reserved.

TI  - Medium voltage drives shine offshore in oil/gas exploration
AB  - Medium voltage (MV) ac drives are highly suitable for offshore deepwater oil/gas drilling exploration projects, which is one of the harshest work environments for electrical equipment. MV operation allows higher power output or lower current usage at the same power. Stena Don, the modern oil drilling rig, designed to work in water depths up to 500 meters makes use of a Siemens Simovert MV frequency converter or variable frequency drive (VFD). A satellite-based Dynamic Positioning System (DPS) used for navigating and positioning Stena Don, provides signals required for precise control of the MV drives and helps to move the rig rapidly between drilling sites. The successful Simovert MV line is being migrated to the next generation MV drives called Sinamics GM150, which incorporates of its predecessor in a newer design.

TI  - Geochemical Negative Emissions Technologies: Part I. Review
AB  - Over the previous two decades, a diverse array of geochemical negative emissions technologies (NETs) have been proposed, which use alkaline minerals for removing and permanently storing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Geochemical NETs include CO2 mineralization (methods which react alkaline minerals with CO2, producing solid carbonate minerals), enhanced weathering (dispersing alkaline minerals in the environment for CO2 drawdown) and ocean alkalinity enhancement (manipulation of ocean chemistry to remove CO2 from air as dissolved inorganic carbon). CO2 mineralization approaches include in situ (CO2 reacts with alkaline minerals in the Earth's subsurface), surficial (high surface area alkaline minerals found at the Earth's surface are reacted with air or CO2-bearing fluids), and ex situ (high surface area alkaline minerals are transported to sites of concentrated CO2 production). Geochemical NETS may also include an approach to direct air capture (DAC) that harnesses surficial mineralization reactions to remove CO2 from air, and produce concentrated CO2. Overall, these technologies are at an early stage of development with just a few subjected to field trials. In Part I of this work we have reviewed the current state of geochemical NETs, highlighting key features (mineral resources; processes; kinetics; storage durability; synergies with other NETs such as DAC, risks; limitations; co-benefits, environmental impacts and life-cycle assessment). The role of organisms and biological mechanisms in enhancing geochemical NETs is also explored. In Part II, a roadmap is presented to help catalyze the research, development, and deployment of geochemical NETs at the gigaton scale over the coming decades.

TI  - Blood biofuels
AB  - Modern energy policy aims to ratchet up the manufacture and use of biofuels, i.e. any fuel produced from biological materials. Yet biofuels derived from agricultural crops and residues, wood, forest residues, or other kinds of plant-based biomass feedstocks can be as environmentally and socially devastating as the finite fossil fuel resources they seek to replace. Often overlooked are their globalization impacts on land grabs, food security, greenhouse gas emissions, drought, deforestation, interference with climate change adaption measures, population displacement, desertification, sea level rise, biodiversity, and scalability. These environmental and social consequences result in food shortages, violent conflicts, urban riots, rural protests, and rising food costs. There is, however, hope for biofuels. Certain other types of biofuels, known collectively as second generation biofuels, are a more suitable alternative for global and regional energy needs because of their availability as well as their significantly reduced public health, environmental, and climate change impacts on society. These new biofuels are derived from algae, seaweed, food waste, and other plant and animal residues. While these biofuels are a more appropriate replacement for fossil fuels than first generation biofuels, they too carry with them potentially significant impacts. Therefore, a cautionary analysis of regulatory and governance regimes for second generation biofuels is critical for improving innovation and investment for this energy resource. To that effect, I provide an inquiry into biofuel law and policy through the theoretical framework of science, technology, society, and the environment (STSE) to assess the hurried development of biofuels and how this biofuel gold rush has had adverse social, economic, and environmental consequences globally. This article concludes with two correlative policy interventions to counter the negative consequences of conventional forest- and agriculturally-based biofuels. First, I question the environmental efficacy of all biofuels as clean energy as defined by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), including those derived from natural resources that compete with food and timber supplies.). Second, I argue that the more stringent Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), as implemented in California and British Columbia, would provide better social and environmental outcomes as a part of the national energy policy plan.

TI  - Limitations of using smart wells to achieve waterflood conformance in stacked heterogeneous reservoirs: Case study from piltun field
AB  - The use of smart completion with downhole fluid control through Inflow Control Valves (ICVs) has been extensively described in the literature for balancing the water injection profile and improving the sweep efficiency in commingled water injection. This paper describes the limitations of such a system in ensuring zonal distribution of water in stacked, highly heterogeneous reservoir systems. Voidage replacement and pressure maintenance requirements necessitate waterflood under fracturing conditions in the four stacked reservoirs (Zone 1 to Zone 4) in Piltun field, offshore Sakhalin Island, Russia. These reservoirs are heterogeneous with differences in their permeability and fracture gradient. Consequently, smart injectors with four ICVs were planned to maintain the desired injection allocation in these reservoirs. The initial injectivity of these wells was extremely low with all of the injected water going to the deepest zone (Zone 4). An expensive pump upgrade improved the overall injectivity, with drastic changes in the distribution of the injected water amongst the reservoir layers. Contrary to performance prior to pump upgrade, the shallowest zone (Zone 1) emerged as the dominant receiver of injected water. Overall, the zonal distribution of water remained a problem with little success in injecting water in the remaining two zones (Zone 2 and Zone 3). Very limited improvement in the water distribution was obtained by manipulating the ICV valves. Sector modeling was taken up for the injection wells to understand the injection behavior. Modelling results show that after the pump upgrade, fracturing was initially achieved in all zones, although sustained fracture opening and propagation was only possible in Zone 1, the reservoir with better flow properties and reasonably low fracture gradient. The other zones gradually reverted back to injection under matrix conditions with time. The additional pressure drop created by the flow control device is not sufficient to choke back the major zones and achieve sustained fracture growth and water injection in the minor zones in Piltun field. The results demonstrate that the use of intelligent completion for waterflood conformance can be limited by large stress and permeability contrast. Â© 2016, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Iron-Marine Algal Interactions and Impacts: Decreasing Global Warming by Increasing Algal Biomass
AB  - Iron limitation in vast water bodies has been linked to decreased algal productivity, despite different iron-acquiring mechanisms, and the presence of ferritin in many algal species that act as an iron internal reservoir. Therefore, iron fertilization has been proposed to increase algal biomass and photosynthesis. This, in turn, will reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and increase oxygen, thereby decreasing global warming, and achieving ecological balance. In addition, algal proliferation will hopefully lead to enhancement in biodiversity, Biological pump, fish productivity and, subsequently marine food industry. Many climate geoengineering experiments in the form of ocean iron fertilization have been conducted globally in order to achieve such a purpose. However, reservations remain as the outcomes are not as promising as were previously expected. As the temporal and spatial scales of iron fertilization experiments are limited, the effects on fish productivity remain speculative. On the other hand, side effects were also recorded. The main purpose of iron fertilization, for carbon dioxide sequestration and global warming mitigation, still remains to be fully realized and verified. Several improvements and future modifications are suggested, and legal issues are discussed in this review.

TI  - Direct and indirect effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on net ecosystem production in a Chesapeake Bay tidal wetland
AB  - The rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations (Ca) has resulted in extensive research efforts to understand its impact on terrestrial ecosystems, especially carbon balance. Despite these efforts, there are relatively few data comparing net ecosystem exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and the biosphere (NEE), under both ambient and elevated Ca. Here we report data on annual sums of CO2 (NEEnet) for 19 years on a Chesapeake Bay tidal wetland for Scirpus olneyi (C3 photosynthetic pathway)- and Spartina patens (C4 photosynthetic pathway)-dominated high marsh communities exposed to ambient and elevated Ca (ambient + 340 ppm). Our objectives were to (i) quantify effects of elevated Ca on seasonally integrated CO2 assimilation (NEEnet = NEEday + NEEnight, kg C m-2 y-1) for the two communities; and (ii) quantify effects of altered canopy N content on ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration. Across all years, NEEnet averaged 1.9 kg m-2 y-1 in ambient Ca and 2.5 kg m-2 y-1 in elevated Ca, for the C3-dominated community. Similarly, elevated Ca significantly (P &lt; 0.01) increased carbon uptake in the C4-dominated community, as NEEnet averaged 1.5 kg m-2 y-1 in ambient Ca and 1.7 kg m-2 y-1 in elevated Ca. This resulted in an average CO2 stimulation of 32% and 13% of seasonally integrated NEEnet for the C3- and C4-dominated communities, respectively. Increased NEEday was correlated with increased efficiencies of light and nitrogen use for net carbon assimilation under elevated Ca, while decreased NEEnight was associated with lower canopy nitrogen content. These results suggest that rising Ca may increase carbon assimilation in both C3- and C4-dominated wetland communities. The challenge remains to identify the fate of the assimilated carbon.

TI  - Structural integrity monitoring index for ship and offshore structures
AB  - Recent years have seen enormous activity in the development of Structural Integrity Monitoring/Structural Health Monitoring equipment and systems for Ship and Offshore Structures. Systems based on technology that could in the past have only been used under laboratory conditions are now frequently deployed offshore very often claiming accuracy and reliability commensurate with laboratory measurements. Monitoring is certainly an exciting prospect and has many advantages over traditional NDT; there are however, some very fundamental issues that must be resolved to benefit fully from these new technologies. Not least of these is the development of objective measures to quantitatively assess the performance characteristics of monitoring technologies. This paper presents the background and development of such a measure of performance based on a fatigue failure model for Ships and Offshore Structures. This new measure, the Structural Integrity Monitoring Index or SIMDex can be similarly applied using any failure model and criterion and means that Structural Integrity Monitoring technologies can be objectively judged solely on their suitability for specific applications.

TI  - Marine Energy Exploitation in the Mediterranean Region: Steps Forward and Challenges
AB  - This works aims to describe current perspectives for marine energy exploitation in the Mediterranean basin, highlighting challenges and opportunities as well as the factors that still limit its market deployment. Technologies for the conversion of Marine Energy (ME) into electricity are now ready for full-scale deployment in farms of devices, making the final step from demonstration to operability and commercial exploitation. Although marine energy is more abundant along the Atlantic and Nordic European coasts, significant resources are also available in the Mediterranean Sea, opening up new perspectives for sustainable energy production in sensitive coastal areas and for the economic development of Southern Europe. The implementation of ME converters in the Mediterranean is in fact liable to induce significant technological advancements leading to product innovation, due to the local low energy levels which impose more restrictive constraints on device efficiency and environmental compatibility. In addition, the milder climate allows the testing of concepts and prototypes in the natural environment at more affordable costs, lowering capital risks for new and innovative small and medium enterprises. Research institutions and industrial players in Mediterranean countries have already taken up the challenge, despite the numerous limiting factors that still need to be removed. In particular, the ME sector adds up to the many different traditional maritime activities and to the new ocean-related industries that are developing, potentially exacerbating the competition for the use of marine space in the Mediterranean region and threatening its environmental status. The ME sector needs therefore to design suitable instruments to involve all the relevant stakeholders in a participative public debate as to how to best manage the maritime space. As the prospective sea use patterns are rapidly changing, an adequate international legal and policy framework needs to be designed for the coherent management of sea space, and Marine Spatial Planning needs to be finally implemented by EU Member States also in the Mediterranean area. To this end, the creation of transnational clusters of stakeholders is expected be an effective catalyzer, especially as they can foster the exchange of knowledge and best practices both across European countries and between the North and the South shore of the Mediterranean basin.

TI  - Spatial variability of upper ocean POC export in the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean determined using particle-reactive Th-234
AB  - The northern Indian Ocean is globally significant for its seasonally reversing winds, upwelled nutrients, high biological production, and expanding oxygen minimum zones. The region acts as sink and source for atmospheric CO2. However, the efficiency of the biological carbon pump to sequester atmospheric CO2 and export particulate organic carbon from the surface is not well known. To quantify the upper ocean carbon export flux and to estimate the efficiency of biological carbon pump in the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean, seawater profiles of total Th-234 were measured from surface to 300 m depth at 13 stations from 19.9 degrees N to 25.3 degrees S in a transect along 87 degrees E, during spring intermonsoon period (March-April 2014). Results showed enhanced in situ primary production in the equatorial Indian Ocean and the central Bay of Bengal and varied from 13.2 to 173.8 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). POC export flux in this region varied from 0 to 7.7 mmol C m(-2) d(-1). Though high carbon export flux was found in the equatorial region, remineralization of organic carbon in the surface and subsurface waters considerably reduced organic carbon export in the Bay of Bengal. Annually recurring anticyclonic eddies enhanced organic carbon utilization and heterotrophy. Oxygen minimum zone developed due to stratification and poor ventilation was intensified by subsurface remineralization. Th-234-based carbon export fluxes were not comparable with empirical statistical model estimates based on primary production and temperature. Region-specific refinement of model parameters is required to accurately predict POC export fluxes.

TI  - Potential effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide on benthic autotrophs and consumers in stream ecosystems: a test using experimental stream mesocosms
AB  - Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) has been shown to have a variety of ecosystem-level effects in terrestrial systems, but few studies have examined how eCO(2) might affect aquatic habitats. This limits broad generalizations about the effects of a changing climate across biomes. To broaden this generalization, we used free air CO2 enrichment to compare effects of eCO(2) (i.e., double ambient similar to 720 ppm) relative to ambient CO2 (aCO(2) similar to 360 ppm) on several ecosystem properties and functions in large, outdoor, experimental mesocosms that mimicked shallow sand-bottom prairie streams. In general, we showed that eCO(2) had strong bottom-up effects on stream autotrophs, which moved through the food web and indirectly affected consumer trophic levels. These general effects were likely mediated by differential CO2 limitation between the eCO(2) and aCO(2) treatments. For example, we found that eCO(2) decreased water-column pH and increased dissolved CO2 in the mesocosms, reducing CO2-limitation at times of intense primary production (PP). At these times, PP of benthic algae was about two times greater in the eCO(2) treatment than aCO(2) treatment. Elevated PP enhanced the rate of carbon assimilation relative to nutrient uptake, which reduced algae quality in the eCO(2) treatment. We predicted that reduced algae quality would negatively affect benthic invertebrates. However, density, biomass and average individual size of benthic invertebrates increased in the eCO(2) treatment relative to aCO(2) treatment. This suggested that total PP was a more important regulator of secondary production than food quality in our experiment. This study broadens generalizations about ecosystem-level effects of a changing climate by providing some of the first evidence that the global increase in atmospheric CO2 might affect autotrophs and consumers in small stream ecosystems throughout the southern Great Plains and Gulf Coastal slope of North America.

TI  - Elevated CO2 impact on growth and lipid of marine cyanobacterium Phormidium valderianum BDU 20041- towards microalgal carbon sequestration
AB  - The growth of marine cyanobacteria at elevated CO2 levels is one of the feasible means to bioremediate the greenhouse gases. The present paper describes a marine filamentous cyanobacterium Phormidium valderianum BDU 20041 that can grow at elevated CO2 levels (15\%), simulated and actual flue gas. Compared to ambient air and other tested CO2 concentrations, 3\% CO2 showed higher biomass productivity, growth rate and carbon fixation rate. The organism was able to tolerate 15\% CO2 and the simulated flue gas conditions making it a strong candidate for microalgal carbon capture. The lipid content of P. valderianum BDU 20041 at 15\% CO2, simulated and actual flue gas conditions was higher than the ambient air. The conditions tested, i.e. 15\% CO2, simulated and real flue gas show that this organism could be a potential entity in curbing carbon emission and a plausible biodiesel feedstock through hydrothermal liquefaction.

TI  - Maximizing Brine Recovery After the Displacement of Reservoir Drill-in Fluids to Reduce Well Cost Via New, Alternate Technology In a Reservoir Offshore Abu Dhabi
AB  - Objectives/Scope: This paper outlines a new and innovative technology for brine recovery after the displacement of Reservoir Drill-In Fluid Non-Aqueous Fluid (RDF NAF) to Completion Brine and the associated operational, logistical, environmental and economic benefits associated with it. A unique slop treatment technology has been utilized to recover and reuse more than 2,168 bbl per well of expensive contaminated completion fluid to help manage losses and avoid injecting valuable completion fluid into operator's injection well. This has also resulted in reducing impact to the life of the injection well and burden on formation, thereby minimizing impact to subsurface environment and contributing to lower well cost. Methods, Procedures, Process: The contaminated brine was transferred from the displacement of RDF NAF to brine and processed using a novel slop treatment technology to reduce the NTU and TSS to completion brine specifications required for completion operations. After displacing the well from RDF NAF to brine, typical contaminants would be RDF NAF and hi-vis spacer (water-based). The oil-contaminated brine was usually transferred to the tanks of the cuttings treatment contractor, treated and injected into the operator's cuttings re-injection (CRI) well. The new procedure isolated the contaminated brine to be processed through the slop treatment technology to separate and remove the oil and solids from the brine. The slop treatment involved passing the contaminated fluid through a decanter, solids particulate filter, three-phase separator and then a polishing filter to process the fluid to the required NTU and TSS specifications. Results, Observations, Conclusions: The slops treatment unit was implemented for brine processing in 2020 and since then, the solution has achieved desirable operational, logistical, sub-surface environmental and cost related benefits. 2,168 bbl of expensive, contaminated completion brine has been processed per well, for subsequent reuse in the completion operations. Utilization and implementation of this mechanical process, versus the historical filter press process, at the source has had clear tangible savings that can be achieved in all areas of the operation, due to the capability to process oil-contaminated brine at a higher clarity and also the viscous brine at a faster rate. This new processing strategy allowed the operator to set new standards with regards to the recovery of oil-contaminated brine, in the UAE. Novel/Additive Information: This is the first successful processing of oil-contaminated brine to be completed in the UAE utilizing a mechanical technology. This process has established new baselines for the operator to be able to recover oil-contaminated brine. By adapting the existing site-based slop treatment technology, this solution has bridged a gap in the market by using a novel mechanical process to optimize oil-contaminated brine recovery efficiency and maximize returns for operators.

TI  - Design of Combined Cycle Gas Turbine and IoT in Production Electricity from KIVU Lake Methane Gas
AB  - In recent years, Lake Kivu, which has high levels of methane and carbon dioxide in Rwanda, has become a danger due to the release of toxins. The research process is that after the working cycle of the first starter ends, the work of the exhaust gas continues to generate heat, and then, the second heat engine can directly extract energy from the exhaust gas thermal energy. The engine can use different working gases. By transmitting multiple workflows, the system overall efficiency can be increased to 50â€“60%. The overall efficiency of a simple cycle can reach 34%, while the synthetic cycle can be as high as 64%. The theoretical efficiency of Carnot cycle reaches more than 84%. Similar to single-cycle thermal energy, synthetic cycles can be developed for industry and can provide lower temperature thermal energy in specific fields and other applications. This electricity from offshore power plants is new. It will solve the power problem in Rwanda and become a new energy source worldwide. However, the purpose of this study was to design for a cycle gas turbine facility that uses a power plant of combined cycle gas turbine system and the Internet of Things to convert chemical energy in methane gas into electricity throughout the process.

TI  - Potential impact of CO2 emissions on the seafloor
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) aims to capture CO2 from fossil-fuel sources, transport and store it in suitable geological formations where it will be confined for extremely prolonged times. This is considered a feasible way of mitigating global warming. The seafloor is one of the target areas to safely store large volumes of anthropogenic CO2 through the development of sub-seabed CO2 geological storage. For the UK and large parts of Europe, the North Sea is potentially the most suitable location for CCS projects required to achieve planned targets in the reduction of CO2 emission. Other sub-seabed areas are studied for their storage potential in America and Asia. Even if the technology is considered proven, following the experience gained from the oil industry in using CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and a few CO2 storage pilot projects, the risk of CO2 seepage must be addressed considering potential consequences on the marine environment. CO2 emissions may affect the seafloor with physical (e.g. sediments displacement), chemical (e.g. acidification) and biological (e.g. toxicity) effects. Laboratory experiments and the study of natural submarine CO2 vents are contributing to the development of a solid body of knowledge on these effects. The research is largely multidisciplinary, requiring expertise in natural sciences, engineering, chemistry and physics. The main observed consequences of CO2 emissions are a quick and strong acidification of the environment which may lead to the mobilization of pollutants, such as heavy metals, within the sedimentary cover of the seafloor diffusing within the overlying water column. Increased weathering of calcareous substrata is also likely following exposure to CO2- enriched fluids. Potential impacts upon local biodiversity would include displaced dissolved oxygen leading to anoxic regions, and localised ocean acidification. Consequences of increased CO2 would be a reduction in local seawater pH, and in the availability of carbonate ions required by calcifying organisms to grow. Predicted CO2 levels from potential seeps would lead to dissolution of exposed calcium carbonate shells and skeletons of local organisms. While some species would be able to tolerate and survive in such situations, others would die or suffer reduced growth rates. This is particularly pertinent for sessile benthic organisms which could not migrate following the onset of seepage. Naturally occurring submarine CO2 vents located along active tectonic and volcanic areas provide a good example of how organism communities change depending on their proximity to released CO2. For example, coral survival and growth decreases the closer they are to the CO2 vents, with macroalgae dominating the habitat instead. The timing and duration of potential industrial CO2 seeps would preclude the possibility of organism genetic adaptation over successive generations, and as such, possible impacts would depend upon organism acclimation potential and resilience. This chapter reviews the physical, chemical and biological implications of subseabed storage of CO2, and the consequences of potential seep events. Â© 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Cost-efficient Node Deployment for Intrusion Detection in Underwater Sensor Networks
AB  - Underwater sensor network has broad application prospects for performing underwater warning, target detection, and marine environment monitoring. However, traditional cube-filled full-coverage node deployment schemes are costly and infeasible to detect target objects due to the considerably redundant nodes. In this paper, we propose a new scheme with a low cost to detect the target in dynamic waters to reduce the cost of the deployment. Our scheme controls the distributed sensors to move and construct an angular sensor barrier through which the target may pass. The profile-based barrier deployment scheme only needs to adjust node depth to reduce movement costs. During depth adjustment, the proposed method takes the node density, the residual energy of the node and the node movement effect into account so that the randomly distributed nodes are sunk at different depths, and the redundant nodes are removed by the 2-Voronoi diagram lemma. We use the simulation experiment to evaluate the coverage and energy consumption during the movement of the nodes. The analysis of the experimental results shows that the method has good coverage performance. Also, it can reduce and balance energy consumption during the anchor node deployment to extend network uptime.

TI  - Load optimization of central cooling system pumps of a container ship for the slow steaming conditions to enhance the energy efficiency
AB  - The implementation of International Maritime Organization regulations for CO 2 emission reduction has oriented ships to sail at lower speeds. Speed reduction reduces fuel consumption of ships significantly. In order to perform efficient ship operation, energy demand throughout the whole engine room has to be decreased. The goal of the study is to minimize electrical power consumption during slow steaming operation, hence equivalent fuel consumption and emissions could be decreased. A computational study was carried out in order to clarify potential savings with respect to main engine load. The study quantifies the energy savings in main engine cooling system which has significant potential to reduce electrical power consumption in slow steaming operations. Operational requirements are determined with the help of realistic engine room simulator of a container ship which has waste heat recovery system. The values, obtained from the simulator were verified using the technical manual of a diesel engine, which have similar output power range. The results of calculations show that there is great potential to improve energy efficiency when variable pumps are used. Based on the results, from the main engine cooling system, 60% of electrical power demand reduction can be achieved. The power reduction saved by pumps, decreases considerable amount of marine diesel oil consumption as 296.2 tons where 367.4 tons of fuel needed by diesel generators or oil fired boiler. The reduction in fuel consumption is 80% that the saving in the central cooling system corresponds 948 tons of CO 2 emission reduction and $207,300 cost saving. Â© 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The offshore energy industry may have found its trump card
AB  - The National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA) and its members understand that energy improves the lives of every American every day. The Trump Administration is also working to increase offshore access, which was dramatically reduced by the Obama Administration. In Obama's final months in office, Arctic and Atlantic lease sales were removed from the 2017 to 2022 Five-Year Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program, six long-awaited Atlantic OCS seismic survey permit applications were simultaneously denied, and an executive order was issued that permanently withdrew Atlantic and Arctic Ocean areas from future oil and gas leasing. In April 2017, President Trump issued an executive order rescinding President Obama's offshore leasing withdrawals, and in May, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke reversed premature blanket denial of Atlantic seismic survey permit applications through a secretarial order. New surveys of the Atlantic OCS will also help inform the development of the next offshore leasing program, which the Trump Administration began work on last June by issuing a request for information (RFI). This 'All of America' plan sets the table for American energy leadership for the next generation.

TI  - Development of composite fiber optic, electric power, and hydraulic riser umbilical and connector
AB  - Suitable optical fiber units for composite umbilicals were selected from eight different units through six tests, and two types of composite umbilicals were designed and manufactured. The umbilicals selected showed only slight optical transmission losses in the tests, which were simulated under field conditions. Connectors with two optical, three electrical and three hydraulic contacts were manufactured and tested. With hydraulic power, the optical connection loss of the connectors did not exceed 3 dB under 35 kgf/cm in a pressure vessel. Tests results showed that it is possible to use the developed riser umbilical and the connector under atua1 field conditions. Copyright 1989, Offshore Technology Conference.

Significant strides have been made in component performance, materials, analytical tools and unique design and fabrication techniques. These developments have been applied to the recuperated closed gas turbine wherein thermal energy is transferred through a heat exchanger to the single phase gaseous working fluid and waste heat is rejected by means of another heat exchanger. Therefore, the cycle will operate with a large variety of heat sources including liquid, gaseous and solid chemical fuels, nuclear and radioactive decay energy, solar energy and stored heat. Similarly, cycle waste heat can be rejected to air, water or outer space. The closed gas turbine is applicable to the harsh environments of deep oceans, outer space, marine and terrestrial.

TI  - The assessment of mangrove biomass and carbon in West Africa: a spatially explicit analytical framework
AB  - Mangrove forests are highly productive and have large carbon sinks while also providing numerous goods and ecosystem services. However, effective management and conservation of the mangrove forests are often dependent on spatially explicit assessments of the resource. Given the remote and highly dispersed nature of mangroves, estimation of biomass and carbon in mangroves through routine field-based inventories represents a challenging task which is impractical for large-scale planning and assessment. Alternative approaches based on geospatial technologies are needed to support this estimation in large areas. However, spatial data processing and analysis approaches used in this estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon have not been adequately investigated. In this study, we present a spatially explicit analytical framework that integrate remotely sensed data and spatial analyses approaches to support the estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon stock and their spatial patterns in West Africa. Forest canopy height derived from SRTM and ICESat/GLAS data was used to estimate mangrove biomass and carbon in nine West African countries. We developed a geospatial software toolkit that implemented the proposed framework. The spatial analysis framework and software toolkit provide solid support for the estimation and relative comparisons of mangrove-related metrics. While the mean canopy height of mangroves in our study area is 10.2Â m, the total biomass and carbon were estimated as 272.56 and 136.28Â Tg. Nigeria has the highest total mangrove biomass and carbon in the nine countries, but Cameroon is the country with the largest mean biomass and carbon density. The resulting spatially explicit distributions of mangrove biomass and carbon hold great potential in guiding the strategic planning of large-scale field-based assessment of mangrove forests. This study demonstrates the utility of online geospatial data and spatial analysis as a feasible solution for estimating the distribution of mangrove biomass and carbon at larger or smaller scales.

TI  - Modeled CO2 Emissions from Coastal Wetland Transitions to Other Land Uses: Tidal Marshes, Mangrove Forests, and Seagrass Beds
AB  - The sediments of coastal wetlands contain large stores of carbon which are vulnerable to oxidation once disturbed, resulting in high levels of CO2 emissions that may be avoided if coastal ecosystems are conserved or restored. We used a simple model to estimate CO2 emissions from mangrove forests, seagrass beds, and tidal marshes based on known decomposition rates for organic matter in these ecosystems under either oxic or anoxic conditions combined with assumptions of the proportion of sediment carbon being deposited in either oxic or anoxic environments following a disturbance of the habitat. Our model found that over 40 years after disturbance the cumulative CO2 emitted from tidal marshes, mangrove forests, and seagrass beds were 70-80\% of the initial carbon stocks in the top meter of the sediment. Comparison of our estimates of CO2 emissions with empirical studies suggests that (1) assuming 50\% of organic material moves to an oxic environment after disturbance gives rise to estimates that are similar to CO2 emissions reported for tidal marshes; (2) field measurements of CO2 emissions in disturbed mangrove forests were generally higher than our modeled emissions that assumed 50\% of organic matter was deposited in oxic conditions, suggesting higher proportions of organic matter may be exposed to oxic conditions after disturbance in mangrove ecosystems; and (3) the generally low observed rates of CO2 emissions from disturbed seagrasses compared to our estimates, assuming removal of 50\% of the organic matter to oxic environments, suggests that lower proportions may be exposed to oxic conditions in seagrass ecosystems. There are significant gaps in our knowledge of the fate of wetland sediment carbon in the marine environment after disturbance. Greater knowledge of the distribution, form, decomposition, and emission rates of wetland sediment carbon after disturbance would help to improve models.

TI  - Greenhouse gas mitigation technology: An overview of the CO2 capture and sequestration studies and further activities of the IEA Greenhouse Gas R\&D Programme
AB  - The IEA Greenhouse Gas R\&D Programme is an international collaboration supported by 16 countries and several industrial organisations. Its purpose is to evaluate technologies for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. The following are the findings of the first phase of its work: the most appropriate technology for capture of CO2 depends upon the type of power plant and proven technology available. However, capture of CO2 adds substantially to the cost of power generation and reduces plant efficiency. In contrast, storage of CO2, e.g. in the ocean, is unproven but relatively inexpensive. There are major uncertainties about storage, in particular long-range environmental impacts and security. Utilisation of CO2 such as making chemicals has a limited potential.

TI  - The contribution of ocean-based solutions to carbon reduction in China
AB  - Climate change has become a great challenge for humanity. However, the current climate change mitigation measures, primarily concentrate on land, more or less neglecting the vital role of the ocean-based solutions. While the ocean is a crucial regulator of the global climate, ocean-based solutions could also play an essential role in climate change mitigation and policymaking. This paper developed an Ocean-based Solutions Carbon Reduction Assessment Model (OSCRAM) that addresses coastal ecosystems, ocean energy, marine transportation, fishery, and seabed to estimate the oceanic contribution to climate change mitigation. It has been applied to evaluate the capacity of carbon emission reduction through oceans in China. We found that the total contribution for carbon emission reduction was about 6.86 Tg CO2 per year, and it may reach 139.39 Tg in 2030 under the target scenario. The results indicated that the ocean has huge potential to reduce carbon emissions. The development of marine energy and low-carbon marine shipping may have more potential for emission reduction in China, and the government should also protect and restore coastal wetlands for their enormous carbon storage. It can also provide a reference for the globe and other nations in achieving emission reduction goals. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Freight Transport Deceleration: Its Possible Contribution to the Decarbonisation of Logistics
AB  - The paper challenges the conventional view that the movement of goods through supply chains must continue to accelerate. The compression of freight transit times has been one of the most enduring logistics trends but may not be compatible with governmental climate change policies to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60â€“80% by 2050. Opportunities for cutting CO2 emissions by â€˜despeeding' are explored within a freight decarbonisation framework and split into three categories: direct, indirect and consequential. Discussion of the direct carbon savings focuses on the trucking and deep-sea container sectors, where there is clear evidence that slower operation cuts cost, energy and emissions and can be accommodated within current supply chain requirements. Indirect emission reductions could accrue from more localised sourcing and a relaxation of just-in-time (JIT) replenishment. Acceleration of logistical activities other than transport could offset increases in freight transit times, allowing the overall carbon intensity of supply chains to reduce with minimal loss of performance. Consequential deceleration results from other decarbonisation initiatives such as freight modal split and a shift to lower carbon fuels. Having reviewed evidence drawn from a broad range of sources, the paper concludes that freight deceleration is a promising decarbonisation option, but raises a number of important issues that will require new empirical research.

TI  - The Potential of Kelp Saccharina japonica in Shielding Pacific Oyster Crassostrea gigas From Elevated Seawater pCO(2) Stress
AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) caused by elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration is predicted to have negative impacts on marine bivalves in aquaculture. However, to date, most of our knowledge is derived from short-term laboratory-based experiments, which are difficult to scale to real-world production. Therefore, field experiments, such as this study, are critical for improving ecological relevance. Due to the ability of seaweed to absorb dissolved carbon dioxide from the surrounding seawater through photosynthesis, seaweed has gained theoretical attention as a potential partner of bivalves in integrated aquaculture to help mitigate the adverse effects of OA. Consequently, this study investigates the impact of elevated pCO(2) on the physiological responses of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in the presence and absence of kelp (Saccharina japonica) using in situ mesocosms. For 30 days, mesocosms were exposed to six treatments, consisting of two pCO(2) treatments (500 and 900 mu atm) combined with three biotic treatments (oyster alone, kelp alone, and integrated kelp and oyster aquaculture). Results showed that the clearance rate (CR) and scope for growth (SfG) of C. gigas were significantly reduced by elevated pCO(2), whereas respiration rates (MO2) and ammonium excretion rates (ER) were significantly increased. However, food absorption efficiency (AE) was not significantly affected by elevated pCO(2). The presence of S. japonica changed the daytime pH(NBS) of experimental units by \~{}0.16 units in the elevated pCO(2) treatment. As a consequence, CR and SfG significantly increased and MO2 and ER decreased compared to C. gigas exposed to elevated pCO(2) without S. japonica. These findings indicate that the presence of S. japonica in integrated aquaculture may help shield C. gigas from the negative effects of elevated seawater pCO(2).

TI  - Environmental factors affecting corrosion inhibition of wet gas pipelines with an oil soluble inhibitor
AB  - Some factors affecting the corrosion inhibition of steel in CO2 containing environments were examined with a single oil soluble inhibitor to determine the limitations for use in a given wet gas pipeline environment. Corrosion inhibition was not strongly influenced by temperature, or CO2 partial pressure. It was strongly influenced by the hydrocarbon phase, inhibitor concentration, and mechanical mixing of oil and water phases. Inhibitor films demonstrated film persistency, lasting at least two weeks.

TI  - Major regression of Posidonia oceanica meadows in relation with recreational boat anchoring: A case study from Sant'Amanza bay
AB  - The anchoring of large recreational craft constitutes one of the main threats in shallow marine habitats. In the Mediterranean, this activity has seen constant development during the last decades, causing major physical disturbances in Posidonia oceanica meadows and associated ecosystem services. In this context, the main aims of the present study are to estimate the impact of this anchoring on P. oceanica meadows surface areas and carbon fixation and sequestration capacities, in a particularly highly-frequented area (Sant'Amanza bay, Corsica Island). Accurate benthic marine habitats mapping was performed yearly (2019-2021) using a drone coupled with ground-truthing data. The evaluation of carbon fixation and sequestration by the plant was measured at 12 stations within the bay (-5 m to-30 m). The maps of the marine habitats reveal an extensive regression of P. oceanica meadows (7.5 ha) between 2019 and 2020. This destruction represents a 9\% decline in the total carbon fixation and sequestration performed each year by P. oceanica meadows within the bay. The related ecosystem services loss is estimated at 4.72 million euro yr(-1). Although an overall decline of boat anchoring in the seagrass meadow has been observed (e.g. recent enforcement of anchoring regulations), other solutions should be experimented to manage this major carbon sink.
