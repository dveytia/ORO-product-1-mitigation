TI  - Analysis of CO2 pipeline regulations from a safety perspective for offshore carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)
AB  - Offshore carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is emerging as an essential option for decarbonization. Pipelines are an efficient and cost-effective way to transport large volumes of CO2. Safe transportation of carbon dioxide (CO2) to offshore storage and injection facilities is one of the prerequisites to ensuring safe CCUS operation. The current work first examines offshore CO2 pipeline hazards in CCUS projects based on existing literature. Then, it compares pipeline safety regulations in the USA, Europe, Australia, China, and the Middle East, aiming to identify how these regulations have covered these hazards and potential areas for improvement. Lastly, it provides recommendations to enhance CO2 pipelines' safety within CCUS projects. The results suggest that although the examined jurisdictions share a holistic commitment towards safety and environmental protection, notable differences exist. The existing regulations in the USA and Australia do not sufficiently account for the challenges faced in offshore CCUS operations, particularly those posed by CO2 impurities. In Europe, the distinct hazards of CO2 streams from CCUS are acknowledged. However, the required directives and guidelines for pipeline design and operation have not adequately addressed these hazards. Bridging these regulatory gaps requires measures including international harmonization, establishing guidelines for repurposing pipelines, and the implementation of Safety Case legislations. Furthermore, the existing regulatory frameworks can be improved by integrating with standardizing organizations' operating standards and recommended practices (e.g., Det Norske Veritas and International Organization for Standardization). This paper will be a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and industrial stakeholders in understanding the regulatory landscape for offshore CO2 pipelines for CCUS purposes.

TI  - The role of marine bivalves in the oceanic carbon cycle: Physiological processes, carbon budgets and ecosystem perspectives
AB  - Impact of marine bivalves on the oceanic carbon cycle is complex, while addressing this impact is crucial for handling global climate change and achieving carbon neutrality. In this review, the impact of bivalves' physiological processes like calcification, respiration, and biogenic sedimentation on the oceanic carbon dynamics were discussed. Besides, studies on the carbon budget accounting of bivalve physiological processes were reviewed, while the necessity of considering bivalves carbon budget from an ecosystem perspective was proposed. The carbon burial and release in the bivalve reefs were also discussed. Furthermore, greenhouse gas emissions features of bivalve aquaculture were discussed, and the corresponding emission reduction strategies were proposed. This review aims to contribute to the comprehensive understand the role of marine bivalves in the carbon cycle and the sustainable development of bivalve aquaculture.

TI  - Halophytes/Saline Water/Deserts/Wastelands Nexus as a Scalable Climate Mitigation including Freshwater Impacts
AB  - Climate change is rapidly exacerbating and adding to major-to-existential issues associated with freshwater availability and utilization. The massive, thus far untapped saline/salt water/oceanâ€”wastelands/desertsâ€”Halophytes resources nexus can, at scale and profitably, provide major climate change mitigation and greatly alleviate most extant freshwater issues. Approaches include ocean fertilization and saline/seawater agriculture on deserts and wastelands to sequester massive amounts of CO2 and methane and for food, freeing up some 70% of the freshwater now utilized by current agriculture for direct human use. This also enables the production of huge amounts of biofuels and biomass-based chemical feedstock employing the massive capacity of cheap saline/seawater and cheap deserts and wastelands. Overall, saline/seawater can, uniquely, at the scale of the climate and freshwater issues, without desalinization, profitably, utilizing extant technologies, some 40% of the land that is deserts/wastelands, and the 97% of the water that is saline/seawater rapidly, seriously, address land, freshwater, food, energy, and climate.

TI  - Linking carbon storage with land use dynamics in a coastal Ramsar wetland
AB  - Coastal wetland ecosystems make an important contribution to the global carbon pool, yet their extent is declining due to aquaculture -related land use changes. We conducted an extensive investigation into the carbon stock and area coverage of macrophytes in a tropical coastal Ramsar wetland, Kolleru in Andhra Pradesh, India. A total of 72 quadrats of size 1 x 1 m(2) were laid in the wetland, 19 species of macrophytes were collected and analyzed for carbon content using a CNHS analyzer. To assess changes in the wetland macrophytes, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was estimated using Landsat time series data from 1975 to 2023. The importance value index (IVI) of macrophytes scored highest for the Ipomoea aquatica (41.4) and the lowest for Ottelia alismoides (1.9). Non -metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) significantly ( r = 0.1905, p = 0.0361) revealed a clear separation of macrophytes in ordination space. ANOVA indicated highly significant ( p < 0.0001) variations in the carbon content of aboveground and belowground components of macrophytes. Among the different macrophytes, the highest carbon content was found in Phragmites karka (0.6 g. g(-1)) and the lowest was recorded in Utricularia stellaris (0.2 g. g (-1) ). On an average, emergents in the Kolleru wetland sequester 1525 +/- 181 g C m - 2 yr(-1) , rooted floating species sequester 858 +/- 101 g C m - 2 yr(-1), submerged macrophytes sequester 480 +/- 60 g C m - 2 yr(-1) , and free-floating macrophytes sequester 221 +/- 90 g C m - 2 yr(-1) . Land cover mapping revealed a decrease in spread of aquatic vegetation from 225.2 km(2) in 1975 to 100.6 km 2 in 2023. Although macrophytes are vital carbon sinks, the wetland conversion into fishponds has resulted in a loss of 55.3 \% of carbon storage. Therefore, immediate restoration of macrophyte cover is vital for the proper functioning of carbon sequestration and mitigation of climate change impacts.

TI  - Blue carbon habitats in Aotearoa New Zealand-opportunities for conservation, restoration, and carbon sequestration
AB  - Coastal marine habitats (i.e. mangroves, saltmarshes, and seagrasses) have a high capacity for carbon sequestration (termed ``blue carbon{'' and the potential to reduce the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. However, blue carbon habitats have historically decreased as a consequence of land conversion, coastal development, and pollution and are under threat in many locations. Restoration of these habitats can reverse historic losses and generate carbon credits through increased carbon sequestration. With a long coastline, we hypothesized that there would be significant opportunities for coastal blue carbon in Aotearoa New Zealand. Results revealed Aotearoa estuaries and coastal areas contain approximately 20,932 ha of saltmarsh, 30,533 ha of mangrove, and 61,340 ha of seagrass, estimated to sequester a total of approximately 57,800 tC/year. A further 87,861 ha of land was estimated to be potentially suitable for blue carbon projects via tidal restoration, of which 44,149 ha was suitable for saltmarsh restoration (equivalent to 47,239 tC/year if restored), 17,291 ha was suitable for mangroves (26,455 tC/year), and 14,087 ha was suitable for seagrass (4790 tC/year). Both existing extent and restoration opportunity varied throughout the country, with greater opportunity in some regions than others. Nationwide, the total sequestration potential for blue carbon restoration was estimated at 91,680 tC yr-1 if all potential areas were restored. Carbon credits generated by blue carbon projects could be traded on a carbon market in Aotearoa, generate revenue for landowners, provide an additional pathway to meet domestic and international climate change targets, and result in a diversity of other ecological, social, and cultural co-benefits from coastal restoration.

TI  - Carbon sequestration in coastal sediments via in situ capping with steel slag
AB  - A 4000 m 2 steel slag (SS) bed was constructed in the brackish water area for water quality remediation in 2017. This study demonstrates the ability of SS to stimulate carbon sequestration based on one-year pilot and in situ SS beds. The pilot SS bed increased the soil organic matter (SOM) content by 5.1 wt \%, sequestering sewage -derived organic carbon (C org ) as SOM. Notably, recalcitrant SOM increased by over 40 \%, indicating long-term retention of C org in the sediment. SS increased the C org density in the sediment by approximately two times, exceeding that of the dense carbon ecosystems found in global seagrass meadows and peatlands. The complexation of the lowmolecular -weight C org with iron in SS was the main pathway for C org fixation. Benthic animal investigations showed that SS capping fostered an anaerobic fauna ecosystem, aiding biotic C org sequestration. Algae proliferation on the SS bed suggested complex benthic ecosystems with photosynthetic carbon fixation. Overall, SS beds offer a new abiotic carbon sequestration pathway with environmental restoration benefits; in situ capping with metal -containing material is potentially more economical and sustainable compared to traditional landfilling.

TI  - Alkaline earth metal ions affect the dissolution of kaolinite-bearing olivine and its carbon storage effects
AB  - Olivine dissolution applications in coastal environments hold great promise for both ocean alkalinity enhancement and carbon dioxide storage. Yet the dissolution mechanism of olivine and the influence of metal ions, such as Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ , remain unclear. Moreover, the weathering products, such as clay minerals are usually mixed with olivine, and the influence of the associated minerals on the dissolution also unexplored. In this study, an 80day dissolution experiment was performed in Ca 2+ -free artificial seawater (ASW-Ca) and ASW lacking both Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ (ASW-CaMg), to elucidate the mechanism of olivine dissolution and the impact of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ on the presence of an associated clay mineral, kaolinite. To evaluate the mineral properties before and after dissolution, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses were used. Etch pits were observed on olivine ` s surface as well as its reduced crystallinity. The atomic ratio of Mg/Si in olivine decreased from 1.49 +/- 0.56 in the raw samples to 1.29 +/- 0.53 in the samples obtained from ASW-CaMg after undergoing the 80-day dissolution, whereas it was much higher, at 1.85 +/- 0.32, in the samples from ASW-Ca. The increasing Mg/Si was attributed to the Mg 2+ adsorption on the surface of olivine, which inhibited the release of structural Mg 2+ . Hence, Mg 2+ was a key environmental factor influencing the process of olivine dissolution, and estuaries, which have low Mg 2+ content and low pH may be the promising areas for the olivine application. Moreover, in ASW-CaMg, the total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration, and charge concentration of alkaline earth metal ions increased by 3392 +/- 28, 2922 +/- 3, and 3740 +/- 91 mu mol kg -1 , respectively, compared to the data from the blank experiment. Notably, TA and DIC had strong linear relationships with the alkaline earth metal ions (Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ ). The release of free alkaline earth metal cations during olivine dissolution was a controlling factor for long-term carbon dioxide storage in ASW-CaMg. Finally, during the 80-day dissolution experiment, no dissolution of the associated kaolinite was observed, however, kaolinite may influence the olivine dissolution by adsorbing the released Si.

TI  - Integrated Approach to Reservoir Simulations for Evaluating Pilot CO2 Injection in a Depleted Naturally Fractured Oil Field On-Shore Europe
AB  - Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is a necessary requirement for high-emitting CO2 industries to significantly reduce volumes of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere and mitigate climate change. Geological CO2 storage into depleted oil and gas fields is the fastest and most accessible option for CCS deployment allowing for re-purposing existing infrastructures and utilizing significant knowledge about the subsurface acquired during field production operations. The location of such depleted fields in the neighborhoods of high-emitting CO(2 )industries is an additional advantage of matured on-shore European fields. Considering these advantages, oil and gas operators are now evaluating different possibilities for CO2 sequestration projects for the fields approaching end of production. This article describes an integrated approach to reservoir simulations focused on evaluating a CO2 injection pilot at one of these matured fields operated by MND and located in the Czech Republic. The CO2 injection site in focus is a naturally fractured carbonate reservoir. This oil-bearing formation has a gas cap and connection to a limited aquifer and was produced mainly by pressure depletion with limited pressure support from water injection. The article summarizes the results of the efforts made by the multi-disciplinary team. An integrated approach was developed starting from geological modeling of a naturally fractured reservoir, integrating the results of laboratory studies and their interpretations (geomechanics and geochemistry), dynamic field data analysis (pressure transient analysis, including time-lapse) and history matching reservoir model enabling simulation of the pilot CO2 injection. The laboratory studies and field data analysis provided descriptions of stress-sensitive fracture properties and safe injection envelope preventing induced fracturing. The impact of potential salt precipitation in the near wellbore area was also included. These effects are considered in the context of a pilot CO2 injection and addressed in the reservoir simulations of injection scenarios. Single-porosity and permeability reservoir simulations with a dominating fracture flow and black-oil formulation with CO2 simulated as a solvent were performed in this study. The arguments for the choice of the simulation approach for the site in focus are shortly discussed. The reservoir simulations indicated a larger site injection capacity than that required for the pilot injection, and gravity-driven CO2 migration pathway towards the gas cap in the reservoir. The application of the approach to the site in focus also revealed large uncertainties, related to fracture description and geomechanical evaluations, resulting in an uncertain safe injection envelope. These uncertainties should be addressed in further studies in preparation for the pilot. The article concludes with an overview of the outcomes of the integrated approach and its application to the field in focus, including a discussion of the issues and uncertainties revealed.

TI  - Relationship between seagrass community structure and carbon stocks on the coasts of Karimunjawa Marine National Park, Indonesia
AB  - The seagrass ecosystem is considered one of the most effective coastal ecosystems in storing carbon. Carbon stock estimation for a certain ecosystem is highly affected by factors such as species diversity and habitat type. This study aims to investigate the relationship between plant community structure and carbon stocks in the seagrass ecosystem using a case study of six coastal sites in Karimunjawa Marine National Park, Indonesia. In this region, eight seagrass species were recorded, i.e., Enhalus acoroides, Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea rotundata, Halodule pinifolia, Halophila ovalis, Halophila minor, Syringodium isoetifolium, and Oceana serrulata. From the six study sites, the highest estimated carbon stock was 426.2 Mg C ha(-1) (Site 5; Telaga, dominated by E. acoroides). Meanwhile, the lowest estimated carbon stock was 127.4 Mg C ha(-1) (Site 4; Koin, dominated by T. hemprichii). The density of E. acoroides was positively correlated with the total seagrass biomass carbon stocks (r = 0.97; p < 0.01), while its dominance was positively correlated with sediment carbon stocks (r = 0.92; p < 0.05) and total seagrass ecosystem carbon stocks (r = 0.92; p < 0.05). Seagrass ecosystems with different community structures showed different carbon storage capacities. Seagrass ecosystems dominated by large-sized species such as E. acoroides showed higher estimated carbon stocks thus suggesting the importance of considering the variability of community structure in managing seagrass ecosystems for carbon sequestration and storage.

TI  - Projected emissions and climate impacts of Arctic shipping along the Northern Sea Route
AB  - The navigability of Arctic maritime passages has improved with the rapid retreat of sea ice in recent decades, and it is projected that the Northern Sea Route (NSR) will support further increases in shipping in the future. However, the opening of the NSR may bring potential environmental and climate risks to the Arctic and the rest of the world. This investigation assessed shipping emissions along the NSR and the climate impacts under global warming of 2 degrees C and 3 degrees C to support coordinated international decision-making. The results show that the magnitude of annual energy consumption of ships along the NSR is 109 kWh under global warming of 2 degrees C and 3 degrees C. The environmental impacts of the shipping decrease with fuel transition to clean, carbon-neutral fuel sources. Specifically, the maximum emission is CO2 (106 t), followed by NOX (104-5 t), CO (103-4 t), SOX (103 t), CH4 (102-3 t), organic carbon (102-3 t), N2O (101-2 t), and black carbon (BC, 101-2 t), in which CO2 and BC have great difference under high and low loads. Total emission exacerbates Arctic and global warming, and it is more significant in the Arctic in the next twenty years and across the rest of the world in the next one hundred years. The greatest climate impact factor is CO2, followed by NOX and BC which are more important in global and Arctic warming, respectively.

TI  - Environmental behavior and toxic effects of micro(nano)plastics and engineered nanoparticles on marine organisms under ocean acidification: A review
AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) driven by human activities and climate change presents new challenges to marine ecosystems. At the same time, the risks posed by micro(nano)plastics (MNPs) and engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) to marine ecosystems are receiving increasing attention. Although previous studies have uncovered the environmental behavior and the toxic effects of MNPs and ENPs under OA, there is a lack of comprehensive literature reviews in this field. Therefore, this paper reviews how OA affects the environmental behavior of MNPs and ENPs, and summarizes the effects and the potential mechanisms of their co-exposure on marine organisms. The review indicates that OA changes the marine chemical environment, thereby altering the behavior of MNPs and ENPs. These changes affect their bioavailability and lead to co-exposure effects. This impacts marine organisms' energy metabolism, growth and development, antioxidant systems, reproduction and immunity. The potential mechanisms involved the regulation of signaling pathways, abnormalities in energy metabolism, energy allocation, oxidative stress, decreased enzyme activity, and disruptions in immune and reproductive functions. Finally, based on the limitations of existing research, actual environment and hot issues, we have outlined future research needs and identified key priorities and directions for further investigation. This review deepens our understanding of the potential effects of MNPs and ENPs on marine organisms under OA, while also aiming to promote further research and development in related fields.

TI  - Thermodynamic analysis of an innovative system for green hydrogen, oxygen, heat, and electricity production: Application to warm oceanic climate conditions in Pau
AB  - Renewable solar energy-powered multi-generation systems have become cutting-edge technology in the effort to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. This research introduces and evaluates a new multi-generation system that generates eco-friendly hydrogen, electricity, and thermal energy. The suggested system consists of a solar photovoltaic heat pipe (PVT) collector, stratified water storage, and a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer. Increasing the electrical power generated by solar PVT systems helps meet the electrolyzer's power needs, resulting in increased oxygen and hydrogen production. A thermal stratification tank combined with a solar PVT heat pipe collector result in higher thermal and electrical power output from the solar PVT heat pipe collector. For the first time, this work proposes a solar PVT heat pipe collector combined with stratification tank storage and a PEM electrolyzer. An engineering equation solver (EES) is utilized to analyze the thermodynamic fluctuations in temperature within the stratification tank storage and the PVT heat pipe collector. It also evaluates the electrical power generation and efficiency of the solar heat pipe PVT collector, as well as the production rates of hydrogen and oxygen and the efficiency of the electrolyser. This research aims to evaluate the efficiency of a novel configuration for generating green hydrogen and oxygen in warm oceanic areas, with a specific focus on Pau City, France. The findings reveal that increased solar radiation enhances the electrical output of the solar PVT heat pipe and the hydrogen and oxygen production rates of the electrolyser. Under Pau's climatic conditions for three summer days, the solar heat pipe PVT collector achieved an electrical power output of 92.63 W/m2, a hydrogen production rate of 1.154 g/min, and an oxygen production rate of 9.712 g/min. For the same period, the respective values were 73.12 W/m2, 0.9393 g/min, and 7.449 g/min. Additionally, the efficiency of the PVT collector varied, with a minimum efficiency of 0.1345 on sunny days and a higher minimum efficiency of 0.1432 on colder days.

TI  - Legitimacy through representation? Media sources and discourses of offshore wind development
AB  - Introduction The choice of which individuals and entities to include as sources in newspaper articles is an important decision for journalists, in large part because they can shape how readers understand the issue and which arguments become most salient. This is particularly important for issues that are relatively new or unknown to readers. The growing topic of offshore wind in the United States is a prime example of an issue that many people are encountering for the first time via media reporting. This issue has also proven to be highly divisive, with heated oppositional arguments being promoted by different entities. This study seeks to understand which entities are being represented in media coverage of offshore wind, and the different framing strategies that various entities use in quotes about the first two large-scale projects in the United States, South Fork Wind and Vineyard Wind I.Methods We use a newspaper content analysis to identify and code the sources quoted in articles reporting on South Fork Wind and Vineyard Wind I from 2013-2022, as well as the emphasis frames used by each entity.Results We find that coverage varies in the two cases, but developers and political officials are quoted most frequently. As these entities tend to use frames highlighting the benefits of offshore wind more frequently than the risks, those perspectives dominate news coverage. Meanwhile, perspectives of community members and impacted industries such as the fishing industry are represented less frequently in news coverage.Discussion These findings help explain the dominance of certain frames and perspectives in offshore wind, and they raise important questions about which voices are legitimized through representation in news media.

TI  - Temperature sensitivity of detrital photosynthesis
AB  - Background and Aims Kelp forests are increasingly considered blue carbon habitats for ocean-based biological carbon dioxide removal, but knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of their carbon cycle. Of particular interest is the remineralisation of detritus, which can remain photosynthetically active. Here, we study a widespread, thermotolerant kelp (Ecklonia radiata) to explore detrital photosynthesis as a mechanism underlying temperature and light as two key drivers of remineralisation.Methods We used meta-analysis to constrain the thermal optimum (T-opt) of E. radiata. Temperature and light were subsequently controlled over a 119-day ex situ decomposition experiment. Flow-through experimental tanks were kept in darkness at 15 degrees C or under a subcompensating maximal irradiance of 8 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) at 15, 20 or 25 degrees C. Photosynthesis of laterals (analogues to leaves) was estimated using closed-chamber oxygen evolution in darkness and under a saturating irradiance of 420 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1).Key Results T-opt of E. radiata was 18 degrees C across performance variables (photosynthesis, growth, abundance, size, mass and fertility), life stages (gametophyte and sporophyte) and populations. Our models predict that a temperature of >15 degrees C reduces the potential for E. radiata detritus to be photosynthetically viable, hence detrital T-opt <= 15 degrees C. Detritus is viable under subcompensating irradiance, where it performs better than in darkness. Comparison of net and gross photosynthesis indicates that elevated temperature primarily decreases detrital photosynthesis, whereas darkness primarily increases detrital respiration compared with optimal experimental conditions, in which detrital photosynthesis can persist for >= 119 days.Conclusions T-opt of kelp detritus is >= 3 degrees C colder than that of the intact plant. Given that E. radiata is one of the most temperature-tolerant kelps, this suggests that photosynthesis is generally more thermosensitive in the detrital phase, which partly explains the enhancing effect of temperature on remineralisation. In contrast to darkness, even subcompensating irradiance maintains detrital viability, elucidating the accelerating effect of depth and its concomitant light reduction on remineralisation to some extent. Detrital photosynthesis is a meaningful mechanism underlying at least two drivers of remineralisation, even below the photoenvironment inhabited by the attached alga.

TI  - Fishing gear with enhanced drapability and biodegradability: Artificial, eco-friendly fibers inspired by the mussel byssus
AB  - Abandoned, lost, and discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) poses a global challenge for marine ecosystems because it results in the destruction of algal forests, the largest oceanic carbon dioxide sinks. Biodegradable polybutylene succinate (PBS), which has a tensile strength similar to that of nylon, has been suggested as a potential fishinggear material. However, its slow degradation in the marine environment and limited drapability need to be addressed before it can be used in environmentally friendly fishing gear. Inspired by the mussel byssus, a threadlike holdfast known for its stiff yet extensible mechanical properties, we developed fishing gear using a musselbyssus-mimetic fiber (artificial byssus fiber, ABf) structure. The ABf was composed of poly(butylene adipate- co - butylene terephthalate) (PBAT) fibers with favorable draping characteristics coated with mechanically resilient and PBS, which demonstrated sufficient toughness and draping properties for use in fishing gear. AB shows promise as a material for fishing -gear capable of mitigating issues related to ALDFG, especially given its marine degradability by microbial strains that degrade PBS and PBAT. Furthermore, it could serve as a substrate for ocean afforestation, given the improved settlement and growth of seaweed spores ( Pyropia yezoensis ) on AB. Overall, AB -based fishing gear is expected to enhance macroalgal forest conservation and expansion and facilitate marine carbon capture through marine afforestation.

TI  - An optimisation method for planning and operating nearshore island power and natural gas energy systems
AB  - As the development and use of offshore islands increase, so do the diversity of their energy needs, the cost of utilising the mainland for resource replenishment, and the instability of island energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an innovative system integrating fossil and renewable energy tailored for these islands, considering seasonal variations and external energy fluctuations. Leveraging a P-graph, an optimisation framework is designed to assess different optimised solutions. A comprehensive analysis is also performed to compare the solutions, while sensitivity assessments evaluate factors including electricity and gas price fluctuations, renewable energy availability, and natural gas demand. Additionally, the carbon emissions resulting from different power generation scenarios are visually represented and thoroughly analysed. The results support two key findings: 1) the cost of combined energy supply is lowest when wind energy accounts for 59 \% of the total energy, mainland grid connection accounts for 3 \%, fossil fuel energy accounts for 28 \%, and natural gas accounts for 10 \% of the energy mix; and 2) the price of electricity and natural gas supplied to the islands and the variability in the energy sources of wind and natural gas can significantly affect the cost of the energy system.

TI  - Spatio-temporal dynamics of the carbonate system during macroalgae farming season in a semi-closed bay in southeast China
AB  - Ocean Negative Carbon Emission (ONCE) involves utilizing natural marine chemistry and biology, along with mariculture, to achieve carbon sink goals. Growing awareness of the interplay between aquaculture and the coastal carbonate system has drawn researchers' attention amid ring CO2 concentrations and the negative impacts of aquaculture on the environment. In this study, twelve sites representing different maricultural types were selected, including macroalgae, shellfish, fish, and non-farming areas. The environmental factors, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), and pCO2, were measured monthly during kelp farming periods. Nitrate is a major component of total nitrogen, and the NO3-N concentration in the macroalgal culture zone was lower than others, indicating effective nitrogen removal by macroalgae aquaculture. TA and DIC in non-farmed areas demonstrated larger variation ranges than in farming areas, probably due to the effects of precipitation on salinity. Aquaculture activities effectively maintained TA and DIC, with macroalgae cultivation playing an important role in TA stability, potentially resisting acidification. The pCO2sea-air of macroalgae culture areas in spring was slightly negative, suggesting carbon sink potential. However, further research is needed to assess the full extent of this ``fourth type{''} of blue carbon, including accurate carbon footprint calculation and the contributions of particulate organic carbon and recalcitrant dissolved organic carbon. This study provided insight into the comprehensive contribution of different aquaculture types to the fishery environment and carbonate system, which can help guide aquaculture management and facilitate the carbon-neutral transition of aquaculture.

TI  - Carbon fluxes of China's coastal wetlands and impacts of reclamation and restoration
AB  - Coastal wetlands play an important role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and contribute significantly to climate change mitigation. However, climate change, reclamation, and restoration have been causing substantial changes in coastal wetland areas and carbon exchange in China during recent decades. Here we compiled a carbon flux database consisting of 15 coastal wetland sites to assess the magnitude, patterns, and drivers of carbon fluxes and to compare fluxes among contrasting natural, disturbed, and restored wetlands. The natural coastal wetlands have the average net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) of -577 g C m(-2) year(-1), with -821 g C m(-2) year(-1) for mangrove forests and -430 g C m(-2) year(-1) for salt marshes. There are pronounced latitudinal patterns for carbon dioxide exchange of natural coastal wetlands: NEE increased whereas gross primary production (GPP) and respiration of ecosystem decreased with increasing latitude. Distinct environmental factors drive annual variations of GPP between mangroves and salt marshes; temperature was the dominant controlling factor in salt marshes, while temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation were co-dominant in mangroves. Meanwhile, both anthropogenic reclamation and restoration had substantial effects on coastal wetland carbon fluxes, and the effect of the anthropogenic perturbation in mangroves was more extensive than that in salt marshes. Furthermore, from 1980 to 2020, anthropogenic reclamation of China's coastal wetlands caused a carbon loss of similar to 3720 Gg C, while the mangrove restoration project during the period of 2021-2025 may switch restored coastal wetlands from a carbon source to carbon sink with a net carbon gain of 73 Gg C. The comparison of carbon fluxes among these coastal wetlands can improve our understanding of how anthropogenic perturbation can affect the potentials of coastal blue carbon in China, which has implications for informing conservation and restoration strategies and efforts of coastal wetlands.

TI  - Ocean alkalinity enhancement impacts: regrowth of marine microalgae in alkaline mineral concentrations simulating the initial concentrations after ship-based dispersions
AB  - Increasing the marine carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption capacity by adding alkaline minerals into the world's oceans is a promising marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) approach to increase the ocean's CO2 storage potential and mitigate ocean acidification. Still, the biological impacts of dispersion of alkaline minerals need to be evaluated prior to its field deployment, especially the impacts of the initial discharge causing local and temporary extreme alkalinity/pH changes. In this study, the toxicity effect on marine microalgae of two commonly used alkaline minerals, calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) and magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2), was determined by adding the same equivalent molar concentration of hydroxyl ions. Cultures of marine green microalgae Tetraselmis suecica were exposed to Ca(OH)2 or Mg(OH)2, in concentrations mimicking the initial high concentrations following a dispersion scenario from a ship. A short-term exposure with high-alkaline mineral concentration called ``dispersion phase{''} was followed by a dilution step and a ``regrowth{''} phase over 6 d. There was no detectable effect of Mg(OH)2 treatment on algae growth either after the dispersion phase or during the regrowth phase, compared to control treatments. The Ca(OH)2 treatment resulted in very few living algal cells after the dispersion phase, but a similar growth rate was observed during the regrowth phase as was for the Mg(OH)2 and control treatments. Standardized whole effluent toxicity (WET) tests were carried out with a range of Mg(OH)2 concentrations using a sensitive marine diatom, Skeletonema costatum, which confirmed the relatively low toxicity effect of Mg(OH)2. Similar biological effects were observed on natural microalgae assemblages from a local seawater source when applying the same Mg(OH)2 concentration range and exposure time used in the WET tests. The results suggest that Mg(OH)2 is relatively safe compared to Ca(OH)2 with respect to marine microalgae.

TI  - An integrated multi-objective optimization, evaluation, and decision-making method for ship energy system
AB  - With the rapid development of global shipping industry, the energy conservation and emission reduction issue of ships has received increasing attention from the international community. A series of regulations released by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) have greatly stimulated the related research. However, the mechanism of optimization design and evaluation of marine ship energy system at the whole ship level based on the comprehensive consideration of various performance of ships is still unclear. In the present study, an integrated modeling method of multi-objective optimization and evaluation for ship energy system are proposed to optimize the design of ship energy system. This paper constructs a technical selection, capacity allocation, and operational optimization model for ship energy systems using mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) method. Based on determining relevant constraints and multiple objective functions, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method is introduced to evaluate and make decisions on the multi-objective optimization results, and compared with traditional decision-making method. The economic optimization results show that the net present cost of ship energy system can be reduced by 20\%, while the NOx, SOx and CO2 emissions of the system are reduced by 41\%, 20\% and 32\%, respectively. Moreover, the energy efficiency of the optimized ship energy system is improved by 9\% compared to the conventional ship energy system. In summary, the proposed method can effectively identify the advantages and disadvantages of different solutions, therefore provide more design options of sub-optimal schemes for decision makers.

TI  - Green turtle tracking leads the discovery of seagrass blue carbon resources
AB  - Seagrass meadows are natural carbon sinks, and their conservation and restoration play a crucial role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. However, blue carbon projects are hindered, in most nations, by major gaps in understanding the distribution and extent of seagrasses. Here, we show how satellite tracking of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) provided a major advance in identifying novel seagrass blue carbon resources in the Red Sea. By tracking 53 nesting green turtles, we identified 38 distinctive foraging sites. All ground-truthed foraging sites (100\%) identified a seagrass meadow, surpassing the 40\% (n = 30) accuracy of satellite imagery-based inferences. Sampling from these turtle-derived locations represents a greater range of depths than previously sampled in the Red Sea providing a carbon stock estimate of 4.89 +/- 0.83 kg Corg (organic carbon) m-2. By improving estimates of seagrass extent and associated blue carbon, our approach can support the conservation of blue carbon resources in data-deficient regions worldwide.

TI  - Assessing the prospect of bio-methanol fuel in China from a life cycle perspective
AB  - Along with rapid industrial development, China has become the world's largest energy consumer and CO2 emitter. In recent years, bio-methanol has been used as one of the low-carbon alternative energy sources in the transportation sector. This study assessed the development prospects of bio-methanol fuel with corn straw as a common feedstock in China in terms of energy consumption, environmental emissions, and economic costs based on life cycle assessment. In this study, the life cycle of bio-methanol fuel was divided into three stages: biomass growth, biomass collection, and methanol production. The results showed that the energy consumption of methanol extracted from biomass was 51.02 x 104 MJ/ton, CO2 emission was 667.53 kg/ton, and the economic cost was \$502.0/ton (UD\$ in 2022). Compared with coal-to-methanol fuel, although the life cycle economic cost was increased by 24.46\%, the CO2 emission was reduced by 59.39\%. If the bio-methanol fuel is applied to the marine industry, which currently has high carbon emissions and operating costs, the carbon emissions could be reduced by 54.01\% per km, and the economic cost could be saved by 14.81\% per km compared to the conventional diesel fuel. Some policy recommendations for developing bio-methanol in China are provided in the end.

TI  - The future of ship engines: Renewable fuels and enabling technologies for decarbonization
AB  - Shipping is one of the most efficient transportation modes for moving freight globally. International regulations concerning decarbonization and emission reduction goals drive rapid innovations to meet the 2030 and 2050 greenhouse gas reduction targets. The internal combustion engines used for marine vessels are among the most efficient energy conversion systems. Internal combustion engines dominate the propulsion system architectures for marine shipping, and current marine engines will continue to serve for several decades. However, to meet the aggressive goals of low-carbon-intensity shipping, there is an impetus for further efficiency improvement and achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions. These factors drive the advancements in engine technologies, low-carbon fuels and fueling infrastructure, and emissions control systems. This editorial presents a perspective on the future of ship engines and the role of low-life cycle-carbon-fuels in decarbonizing the marine shipping sector. A selection of zero-carbon, net-zero carbon, and low-lifecycle-carbon-fuels are reviewed. This work focuses on the opportunities and challenges of displacing distillate fossil fuels for decarbonizing marine shipping. Enabling technologies such as next-generation air handling, fuel injection systems, and advanced combustion modes are discussed in the context of their role in the future of low-CO2 intensity shipping.

TI  - Terrestrial inputs boost organic carbon accumulation in Mexican mangroves
AB  - Despite their ability to mitigate climate change by efficiently absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and acting as natural long-term carbon sinks, mangrove ecosystems have faced several anthropogenic threats over the past century, resulting in a decline in the global mangrove cover. By using standardized methods and the most recent Bayesian tracer mixing models MixSIAR, this study aimed to quantify source contributions, burial rates, and stocks of organic carbon (C-org) and explore their temporal changes (similar to 100 years) in seven lead-210 dated sediment cores collected from three contrasting Mexican mangrove areas. The spatial variation in C-org burial rates and stocks in these blue carbon ecosystems primarily depended on the influence of local rivers, which controlled C-org sources and fluxes within the mangrove areas. The C-org burial rates in the cores ranged from 66 +/- 16 to 400 +/- 40 g m(-2) yr(-1). The C-org stocks ranged from 84.9 +/- 0.7 to 255 +/- 2 Mg ha(-1) at 50 cm depth and from 137 +/- 2 to 241 +/- 4 Mg ha(-1) at 1 m depth. The highest C-org burial rates and stocks were observed in cores from the carbonate platform of Yucatan and in cores with reduced river influence and high mangrove detritus inputs, in contrast to patterns identified from global databases. Over the past century, the rising trends in C-org burial rates and stocks in the study sites were primarily driven by enhanced inputs of fluvial-derived C-org and, in some cores, mangrove-derived C-org. Despite their decreasing extension, mangrove areas remained highly effective producers and sinks of C-org. Ongoing efforts to enhance the global database should continue, including mangrove area characteristics and reliable timescales to facilitate cross-comparison among studies.

TI  - Plant-sediment interactions decouple inorganic from organic carbon stock development in salt marsh soils
AB  - The storage of organic carbon in the soils of salt marshes and other coastal blue carbon ecosystems has gained considerable attention by the scientific community for more than a decade now, while the relevance and mechanisms of soil inorganic carbon accumulation remain poorly understood. Using long-term annual accretion monitoring over 17 years in N = 50 permanent plots distributed across a 1050-ha salt-marsh complex of the European Wadden Sea, we identified clear relationships between salt-marsh vertical growth rates and the soil densities of inorganic and organic carbon. Specifically, we demonstrate a strong positive correlation between vertical accretion and inorganic carbon density while observing a strong negative correlation between vertical accretion and organic carbon density. This decoupling observed between inorganic and organic soil carbon stocks was governed by plant community composition and associated plant traits, which controlled sedimentation processes.

TI  - Fiddler crab bioturbation stimulates methane emissions in mangroves: Insights into microbial mechanisms
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are pivotal in blue carbon capture, yet they can also release varying levels of methane (CH4). Fiddler crabs are known players in carbon (C) cycling within mangrove ecosystems, but their precise contributions to CH4 emissions and microbially-driven processes are not yet well understood. We compared CH4 emissions, soil physicochemical properties, and methanogenic and methanotrophic communities in nonbioturbated and bioturbated soils within two mangrove communities: Sonneratia apetala (SA) and Pongamia pinnata (PP). The presence of fiddler crabs led to an increase in CH4 emission rates in the bioturbated soil, ranging from 86\% to 430\% compared to un-bioturbated soil. The bioturbated soil also exhibited higher levels of ammonium, pH, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) but with lower concentrations of nitrate, sulfate, salinity, and total nitrogen. Moreover, an increase was observed in the abundance methanogenic communities, but the abundance and diversity of methanotrophic communities was reduced in the bioturbated soil. The increased abundance of Methanosarcina and reduced abundance of type II methanotrophs in the bioturbated soil could result in an overall increase in CH4 emissions. This study result highlights that bioturbation can greatly influence CH4 emissions in mangroves and emphasizes the importance of considering the ecological role of fiddler crabs in the evaluation of coastal blue carbon sequestration.

TI  - Centralized vs. Decentralized Deployment of Battery Energy Storage System on Offshore Platforms
AB  - Energy storage (ES) integration with offshore platforms is promising if significant cost and carbon emissions reduction needs to be realized. An important question is how ES should be deployed, considering both the centralized and decentralized alternatives. Centralized deployment considers all the ES in one location while in decentralized deployment, the ES is implemented in different locations. In this work, an algorithm is proposed to compare the technical and economic benefits of the centralized and decentralized deployments. The selected case study comprises a 15 MW/25.6 MWh ES deployment for spinning reserve provision and efficiency increase in a real offshore oil and gas platform. For the centralized deployment, two cases are considered with the whole ES capacity located on a new floating platform: near the main platform in one case (case C1) and near a wind farm in the other case (case C2). For the decentralized deployment, two configurations are evaluated for spreading the total ES capacity: a case with one part on the main platform, one part on floating wind turbine (WT) structures and one part on a nearby platform (case D1), and a case with all the BESS spread on floating WT structures (case D2). The results show that for this case study even though the decentralized deployment in case D2 has the lowest efficiency it is potentially the cheapest choice due to the economic impact of installing a new floating platform. However, sensitivity analysis was performed and the results show that given a different case study and significant reduction in cost of floating platform centralized BESS can be promising.

TI  - Quantification and mitigation of bottom-trawling impacts on sedimentary organic carbon stocks in the North Sea
AB  - The depletion of sedimentary organic carbon stocks by the use of bottom-contacting fishing gear and the potential climate impacts resulting from remineralization of the organic carbon to CO 2 have recently been heavily debated. An issue that has remained unaddressed thus far regards the fate of organic carbon resuspended into the water column following disturbance by fishing gear. To resolve this, a 3D-coupled numerical ocean sediment macrobenthos model is used in this study to quantify the impacts of bottom trawling on organic carbon and macrobenthos stocks in North Sea sediments. Using available information on vessel activity, gear components, and sediment type, we generate daily time series of trawling impacts and simulate 6 years of trawling activity in the model, as well as four management scenarios in which trawling effort is redistributed from areas inside to areas outside of trawling closure zones. North Sea sediments contained 552.2 +/- 192.4 kt less organic carbon and 13.6 +/- 2.6 \% less macrobenthos biomass in the trawled simulations than in the untrawled simulations by the end of each year. The organic carbon loss is equivalent to aqueous emissions of 2.0 +/- 0.7 Mt CO 2 each year, roughly half of which is likely to accumulate in the atmosphere on multi-decadal timescales. The impacts were elevated in years with higher levels of trawling pressure and vice versa. Results showed high spatial variability, with a high loss of organic carbon due to trawling in some areas, while organic carbon content increased in nearby untrawled areas following transport and redeposition. The area most strongly impacted was the heavily trawled and carbon-rich Skagerrak. Simulated trawling closures in planned offshore wind farms (OWFs) and outside of core fishing grounds (CFGs) had negligible effects on net sedimentary organic carbon, while closures in marine protected areas (MPAs) had a moderately positive impact. The largest positive impact arose for trawling closures in carbon protection zones (CPZs), which were defined as areas where organic carbon is both plentiful and labile and thereby most vulnerable to disturbance. In that scenario, the net impacts of trawling on organic carbon and macrobenthos biomass were reduced by 29 \% and 54 \%, respectively. These results demonstrate that carbon protection and habitat protection can be combined without requiring a reduction in net fishing effort.

TI  - Current research hotspots and frontier trends on carbon budget of coastal wetlands: A bibliometric analysis
AB  - Coastal wetlands are the main distribution of blue carbon in coastal zones and well known for their high carbon sequestration capacity. Investigating the variation of carbon budget is crucial for understanding the functionality of coastal wetlands and effectively addressing climate change. In this study, a bibliometric analysis of 4,509 articles was conducted to reveal research progress, hot issues, and emerging trends in the coastal wetland carbon budget field. The number of publications and citations in this field increased exponentially from 1991 to 2022. The leading subject category was Environmental Sciences with 1,844 articles (40.9\%). At present, studies have been focused on blue carbon, the effects of climate change and man-made disturbances on carbon cycle, and the restoration of coastal wetlands. Based on the hotspots and trends in this field, the future researches should include (1) exploring the functional mechanisms of various factors affecting carbon cycle and establishing a methodological system for the estimation of blue carbon in coastal wetlands; (2) researching restoration techniques of coastal wetland and constructing wetland restoration evaluation index system; and (3) formulating enforceable carbon trading policy and strengthening international cooperation.

TI  - Assessment of mangrove structures and biomass on islands along the Java Sea: a case study on Bawean Islands and Karimunjawa Islands
AB  - Mangroves on the islands along the Java Sea play a crucial role in supporting biodiversity, protecting coastlines, and sequestering carbon. However, there is a lack of information on mangrove structure and biomass in the area. This study aimed to assess the mangrove structures and biomass on Desa Daun, located on the Bawean Islands, and Kemujan Island, located on the Karimunjawa Islands, respectively. The study utilized a combination of line transect and quadrant plot methods with a size plot of 10x10 m. We established 7 line transects and 28 quadrant plots in the mangrove forest of Desa Daun and similarly set up 7 line transects and 21 quadrant plots on Kemujan Island. Within each quadrant, the mangrove species were identified, and their diameters at breast height (DBH) were recorded. To assess the relative significance of each species, the importance value index (IVI) was calculated, and allometric equations were applied to estimate biomass and carbon storage in the trees. PlanetScope imagery was also used to quantify the carbon stock of mangroves on those islands. In Desa Daun, 13 mangrove species were identified, while 12 species were recorded on Kemujan Island. The species Nypa fruticans and Excoecaria agallocha exhibited the highest IVI in Desa Daun and Kemujan Island, respectively. Notably, Rhizophora apiculata demonstrated the greatest biomass in both locations, with measurements of 43.08 Mg B/ha in Desa Daun and 102.22 Mg B/ha in Kemujan Island. Overall, mangrove stands on Desa Daun stored biomass of 113.60 Mg B/ha and carbon of 50.98 Mg C/ha, whereas mangrove stands on Kemujan Island stored biomass of 295.04 Mg B/ha and carbon of 131.95 Mg C/ha. Mangrove stands of the whole Bawean Islands sequestered 22,941 Mg C, while Karimunjawa Islands hold much higher C stocks, 79,451 Mg C. Despite being smaller in size, the Karimunjawa Islands have more extensive mangrove coverage compared to the Bawean Islands due to their geomorphological characteristics, which in turn influence their mangrove structures and carbon stocks. However, the loss of mangroves in the Karimunjawa Islands due to aquaculture expansions could increase carbon loss in the islands.

TI  - High contribution of an invasive macroalgae species to beach wrack CO2 emissions
AB  - Accumulations of macroalgal wrack are important for adequate functioning of the beach ecosystem. However, the sudden beaching of seaweed masses smothers the coastline and forms decomposing piles on the shore, harming tourism-based economies, but also affecting the beach ecosystem metabolism. The decomposition of sudden pulses of wrack can modify the biogeochemistry of beach sands and increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The presence of invasive species in the wrack deposits can superimpose harmful effects on the beach functioning. We quantified the wrack biomass of Rugulopteryx okamurae, an invasive species of extreme impact, on five sandy beaches from the Atlantic coast of the Strait of Gibraltar (Spain), and we tested the effects on in situ respiratory CO2 fluxes using an infrared gas analyser. All the beaches showed massive accumulations of Rugulopteryx wrack deposits. However, the biomass changed significantly between beaches, ranging (mean + SE) from 968.3 + 287.7 kg m- 1 to 9210 + 1279.4 kg m-1 of wet weight. Wrack supported high respiration rates, with CO2 fluxes averaging (+SE) 19.15 + 5.5 mu mol CO2 m- 2 s-1 across beaches, reaching astounding maximum peaks of 291 mu mol CO2 m- 2 s- 1. The within-beach variability was related to the distance of the wrack deposits from the shoreline, as the average metabolic rates tended to increase significantly from the swash to the drift line. Thicker wrack and a more degraded algae stage showed significantly higher CO2 fluxes. We estimated that the annual CO2 flux of R. okamurae in our study area ranged between 0.39 (+0.01) and 23.30 (+11.33) kg C m- 2 y- 1. We suggest that massive amounts of beach wrack can become a globally significant contributor to GHG emissions that can offset any potential carbon-sink capacity of macroalgal forests. However, the piles of wrack located several meters above the drift line showed non-measurable CO2 efflux. Transferring beach wrack from swash to drier upper-beach areas, a common practice in many coastal regions suffering from massive wrack accumulations, might help reduce GHG emissions while removing the wrack stockpiles from the intertidal. However, this practice is not necessarily suitable for all beaches and can create ecological and conservation problems in the dune system. There is an urgent need to implement practical and sustainable management practices for massive wrack deposits capable of presenting various solutions to achieve a balance between conservation and recreation actions, answering the consequences of a problem that links both, environmental and economic issues.

TI  - Lithium-Ion Batteries on Board: A Review on Their Integration for Enabling the Energy Transition in Shipping Industry
AB  - The emission reductions mandated by International Maritime Regulations present an opportunity to implement full electric and hybrid vessels using large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs). lithium-ionion batteries (LIB), due to their high power and specific energy, which allows for scalability and adaptability to large transportation systems, are currently the most widely used electrochemical storage system.

The basic technical information about system integration has been summarized from various research projects, white papers, and test cases mentioned in available studies. The aim is to provide state-of-the-art information about the installation of BESSs on ships, in accordance with the latest applicable rules for ships. The goal of this study is to facilitate and promote the widespread use of batteries in the marine industry.

TI  - The effects of green finance on the carbon decoupling of marine fishery: analysis based on Tapio method and EKC model
AB  - Marine fishery, with its duality of carbon emission and carbon sink, is an industry that needs full attention during achieving carbon neutrality. In this paper, the decoupling index between net CO2 emissions and gross domestic product of marine fishery in China is calculated using Tapio model, and its evolution characteristics are analyzed by means of nuclear density map and Markov matrix. Some problems are found, such as the decoupling state lacked significant improvement during this period and was unstable. Through theoretical analysis, this paper puts forward the view that solving these problems requires support from green finance. Then, this paper selects panel data from 11 coastal provinces and cities in China from 2010 to 2020 and uses the Logit model and EKC model to investigate the impact of green finance on the carbon decoupling state of marine fishery. The main results of this study are as follows: 1) Green finance can increase the odds ratio of strong or weak decoupling in marine fishery. This effect is more significant in regions with a high degree of digital finance development and the eastern marine economic circle. The effect of green investment is more significant than green insurance. In addition, boosting technological innovation and reducing the proportion of coal consumption can strengthen this effect. 2) The EKC curve between net CO2 emissions and gross domestic product of marine fishery is N-shape, which has a deterioration point. Green finance can delay the arrival of the deterioration point, meaning it can prevent the rapid deterioration of the decoupling state with the development of marine fishery. This paper provides empirical evidence and decision-making reference for resolving the dilemma of carbon decoupling in China's marine fishery.

TI  - Short- and long-term effects of carbon taxation on the prices of products shipped by sea
AB  - This study analyzes econometrically the effect of fuel carbon taxation on the prices of internationally traded goods transported by the maritime sector. Around 80% of global trade by volume is transported by sea, contributing to a nontrivial level of carbon emissions. This study is the first to analyze the effect of carbon taxation on the prices of export products transported by sea, using detailed data for the heaviest 6-digit products from 21 industries that account for 75% of the total weight of goods transported by sea. The results reveal that the closer a product is to the core competence of the exporting firm (lowest marginal production costs), the weaker the effect of the carbon tax will be on prices. This effect on export prices will be even weaker for products of certain industries that have the highest unit sales value/weight ratios. To contribute to decarbonizing the maritime sector, a carbon tax should be maintained uninterruptedly to fully internalize the awareness that improving fuel consumption competitiveness by considering the distance traveled and weight of traded products to ultimately reduce carbon tax costs.

TI  - A 500 kW hydrogen fuel cell-powered vessel: From concept to sailing
AB  - This paper presents the ``Three Gorges Hydrogen Boat No. 1{''}, a novel green hydrogen-powered vessel that has been successfully delivered and is currently sailing. This vessel, integrated with a hydrogen production and bunkering station at its dedicated dock, achieves zero-carbon emissions. It stores 240 kg of 35 MPa gaseous hydrogen and has a fuel cell system rated at 500 kW. We analysed the engineering details of the marine hydrogen system, including hydrogen bunkering, storage, supply, fuel cell, and the hybrid power system with lithium-ion batteries. In the first bunkering trial, the vessel was safely refuelled with 200 kg of gaseous hydrogen in 156 min via a bunkering station 13 m above the water surface. The maximum hydrogen pressure and temperature recorded during bunkering were 35.05 MPa and 39.04 degrees C, respectively, demonstrating safe and reliable shore-toship bunkering. For the sea trial, the marine hydrogen system operated successfully during a 3-h voyage, achieving a maximum speed of 28.15 km/h (15.2 knots) at rated propulsion power. The vessel exhibited minimal noise and vibration, and its dynamic response met load change requirements. To prevent rapid load changes to the fuel cells, 68 s were used to reach 483 kW from startup, and 62 s from 480 kW to zero. The successful bunkering and operation of this hydrogen-powered vessel demonstrates the feasibility of zero-carbon emission maritime transport. However, four lessons were identified concerning bunkering speed, hydrogen cylinder leakage, hydrogen pressure regulator malfunctions, and fuel cell room space. The novelty of this work lies in the practical demonstration of a fully operational, hydrogen-powered maritime vessel achieving zero emissions, encompassing its design, building, operation, and lessons learned. These parameters and findings can be used as a baseline for further engineering research.

TI  - Ship sailing speed optimization considering dynamic meteorological conditions
AB  - Sailing speed optimization is a cost-effective strategy to improve ship energy efficiency and a viable way to fulfill emission reduction requirements. This study develops a novel ship sailing speed optimization method that considers dynamic meteorological conditions. We first develop an artificial neural network model for vessel fuel consumption rate (FCR) prediction based on a fusion dataset of ship noon reports and public meteorological data. Then, based on the predicted FCRs, the method repeatedly formulates a multistage graph based on the most recent forecasts, and optimal speeds for the remaining voyage are obtained until the vessel reaches the destination port. The computational efficiency of the optimization process is enhanced by progressively removing nodes without connections to successor nodes, starting from the penultimate stage. We examine the proposed method on two 11-day voyages of a dry bulk carrier. Results show that the proposed method demonstrates significant reductions in fuel consumption by 5.35\% compared with a constant sailing speed scheme and by 7.34\% compared with a static speed optimization model. In addition, the proposed model achieves similar fuel savings to those achieved by speed optimization based on actual meteorological conditions, enabling shipping companies to optimize ship sailing speeds in the absence of actual meteorological conditions. The proposed method can be applied to various types of vessels due to its flexibility and adaptability, making it a valuable tool for the shipping industry to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby supporting the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s goal of reaching net-zero GHG emissions by around 2050.

TI  - Ship Type Selection and Cost Optimization of Marine Container Ships Based on Genetic Algorithm
AB  - In the context of the deep-sea transportation supply chain, this paper addresses the complex decision-making problem of vessel allocation and carbon emission optimization for container shipping routes. A bi-level programming model is established, with the upper level aiming to minimize the total operational cost and the lower level focusing on minimizing carbon emissions. Using an example of an operator with five different types of vessels, a genetic algorithm is employed to determine the optimal vessel allocation scheme. The results indicate that the vessel allocation scheme obtained through multiple iterations of the model effectively reduces both carbon emissions and operational costs. Under the condition that the preset labor cost increases year by year, the use of model optimization can significantly reduce the growth of total operating costs. This paper provides theoretical support and practical guidance for shipping companies aiming to optimize decision-making in order to reduce operational costs and carbon emissions.

TI  - Techno-Economic Feasibility of the Use of Floating Solar PV Systems in Oil Platforms
AB  - Offshore facilities have high energy demands commonly accomplished with local combustion-based power generators. With the increased commercialization of the marine renewable energy sector, there is still a need for research on floating photovoltaic installations on their performance and economic perspective. This paper investigates the techno-commercial feasibility of installing a battery-integrated floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) system for an offshore oil platform facility in Abu Dhabi. The performance analysis of two floating PV design schemes has been evaluated using the PVsyst design tool. The proposed system's annual solar energy availability from the PVsyst 7.2.21 output was validated with MATLAB Simulink R2022b with a deviation of 1.85\%. The optimized solution achieved the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of 261 USD/MWh with a Discounted Payback Period of 9.5 years. Also, the designed system could reduce carbon emissions by 731 tons per year. Furthermore, it was recognized that the contribution of the marine sector to the construction of floating platforms influences the success of floating PV systems. Independently authorized floating PV system designs would guarantee insurability from the viewpoints of investors and end users.

TI  - Approaching zero emissions in ports: implementation of batteries and supercapacitors with smart energy management in hybrid ships
AB  - The urgent need to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact in the shipping industry has prompted research and industry to explore new solutions for minimizing fuel usage. This study examines the potential effects and benefits of integrating electrical energy storage systems, such as lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors, into short sea shipping ships during port stay. Specifically, a novel dynamic simulation tool is developed to conduct suitable analyses that investigate the feasibility of charging electrical storage systems while at navigation and utilizing them as alternatives to traditional diesel generators while in port. The analysis reveals that lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors are effective tools for reducing pollutant emissions by minimizing diesel generator usage during port stopovers, resulting in a significant reduction in fuel consumption from 1.148 kt/year to 0.511 kt/year. Moreover, under identical conditions, the use of supercapacitors increases the lifespan of batteries from 10.6 years to 11.9 years. Additionally, there is a 55 \% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions during port stays, decreasing from 2.98 kt/year to 1.64 kt/year.

TI  - Cryogenic energy assisted power generation utilizing low flammability refrigerants
AB  - Cryogenic carbon-neutral fuels are potential alternatives as future marine fuels, releasing waste cryogenic energy during regasification and waste thermal energy during combustion. Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs), using flammable hydrocarbon working fluids, are the preferred waste energy reutilization technology, prioritized over Brayton and Kaline cycles due to their compact system configuration. However, hydrocarbon flammability and explosiveness poses a huge safety risk. Therein lies the novelty of this study which presents an advanced dynamic model of a cryogenic enhanced ORC utilizing low flammability hydrofluorocarbons as working fluids for simultaneous reutilization of waste thermal and cryogenic energy from carbon-neutral cryogenic fuels. The evaporation temperature exhibits a direct correlation with energy and an inverse correlation with the exergy performance. System overcharging leads to a drastic performance decline, while undercharging can be tolerated to a certain liquid-to-volume ratio until critical failure. Marine classification societies' recommendations-based scenarios were employed to gauge the emission reduction potential of low flammability working fluids for cryogenic ORCs, pitted against traditional combustion technologies. A maximum specific net-work, thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency, and cryogenic energy efficiency of 45.64 kJ/kg, 10.43\%, 12.75\%, and 11.8\% was achieved, respectively, with 85 \% reduction in GHG emissions, using R452B as the working fluid.

TI  - Assessing sustainable decarbonization strategies for green shipping using tugboat owner investment in hybrid power systems in ports in Taiwan
AB  - Decarbonization has significant operational implications for ships, fuel resources, and ports. Sustainable management is highly prioritized by ship owners and port authorities. The shipping industry must develop appropriate strategies to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050 and support the 2030 United Nations sustainable development goals. Tugboats, a ubiquitous vessel in Taiwanese ports, were selected as the subject of this study. Implementing hybrid power systems in response to the growing trend of carbon reduction was explored. This study involves various stakeholders in Taiwan, including ship owners, port agency representatives, and other relevant parties. Assessing investment costs, market demand, and policy guidance is highly significant. Establishing a positive cycle is necessary to encourage tugboat operators to adhere to sustainable management practices and environmental protection measures. This entails providing incentives through policy measures that enable tugboat operators to gain cost advantages and balance environmental, economic, and societal needs within an expanding market.

TI  - Variation in soil organic carbon with structural composition of mangrove species in the Sundarbans
AB  - The world's biggest continual mangrove swampy land is the Sundarbans Mangrove Forest, which is crucial to both the terrestrial and marine carbon cycles. While numerous studies have focused on organic carbon variations within this ecosystem, few have explored the interaction between carbon stocks and the structural composition of mangrove species. This study sought to investigate the connection between soil organic carbon accumulation and functional attributes of vegetation (DBH, basal area). This study was carried out on four vegetative and two non-vegetative plots in three different sites within the oligohaline zone. Based on species Iv, the Karamjol area was prevalent by Heritiera fomes (Iv =139.3). In contrast, the Ghagramari area was predominated by Avicennia officinalis (I-V =105.1). Accumulation of TBC, Avicennia officinalis presented the highest, despite having a smaller number of individuals within the study area. 1 m soil core was pulled out from each subplot of each main plot by using a one-meter-long open face peat auger. The forest areas exhibited maximum soil organic carbon accumulation, which was significantly (p < 0.01) higher than non-vegetative areas. Moreover, the mean soil C/N ratios in the Karamjol area (13.4 +/- 0.2) and Ghagramari area (13.2 +/- 0.2) were significantly (p < 0.01) greater than those in the non-vegetative area (12.3 +/- 0.1). These findings suggest that regardless of the dominant species, species richness, or size (tall or dwarf) of the mangroves, a particular quantity of organic carbon is captured within the mangrove soil. Thus, when making future decisions, it is crucial to repute the role of the Sundarbans mangrove in the accumulation of organic and biomass carbon, which can directly affect mitigating global warming.

TI  - Integrated seawater hub: A nexus of sustainable water, energy, and resource generation
AB  - This review paper explores the potential for seawater desalination plants to operate as integrated hubs for addressing the increasing demand for water, energy, mineral resources, and foods, particularly in resource-scarce regions. The integrated seawater hub (ISH) utilizes seawater as a common input, provides multipurpose facilities that can cater to freshwater and agricultural requirements, brine processing for salt and minerals extraction, promotes energy recovery, and mitigates greenhouse gas emissions by employing renewable and alternative energy technologies, thereby bolstering sustainable development. Capitalizing on seawater, the most abundant resource on our planet, these plants can contribute significantly to the sustainability sector. This study delves into the essential aspects of integrating mainly the seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination process to create a portfolio of clean, sustainable water supplies, energy sources, and other valuable products. Furthermore, this paper seeks to offer a comprehensive analysis within a unified framework, incorporating various established technologies that demonstrate the multifaceted capabilities of desalination plants. This includes the delivery of a freshwater supply and effectively repurposing the brine, the primary liquid waste product from these facilities. Emphasizing the potential to achieve a circular economy centered on brine management, our review presents an environmentally friendly approach to urban development. The study also explores emerging research domains where seawater desalination plants utilize renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and biomass to produce clean water and green hydrogen. It suggests that further research and investment in the realm of integrated seawater resource hubs could yield significant benefits for both local communities and the wider global community.

TI  - Genetic Algorithm-Based Synthesis-, Design-, and Operation Optimization of Large Sector Coupled Ship Energy Systems
AB  - The decarbonization of the maritime industry is crucial for mitigating climate change. Achieving this goal involves increasing power generation efficiency, adopting non-fossil fuels, and enhancing overall ship efficiency. This study introduces the Maritime Energy System Optimizer (MESO), a modular Python platform designed to enhance ship concepts through holistic synthesis, design, and operation optimization of sector coupled ship energy systems (ES). MESO uses a genetic algorithm for synthesis and design optimization, and, nested within the fitness calculation, a mixed-integer linear programming approach for operation optimization based on power flows and energy balances using the open energy modelling framework (oemof). Validation studies, based on a 2018 cruise liner with 30 MW propulsion power and high demand granularity, demonstrated the effectiveness of MESO for various levels of detail. MESO reduces unnecessary iterations compared to the conventional heuristic design process and enables more informed decision-making. Optimized ESs are at least 4.4 % cheaper than conventional systems, mainly due to the integration of storages for peak shaving and load balancing. MESO is designed for easy expansion and will be extended to include partial load efficiency, demand-side management, and load profile generation. Â© 2024 IEEE.

TI  - Green hydrogen potential in tropical countries: The colombian case
AB  - Tropical countries can approach their natural resources to produce low-carbon H2 from solar, wind, hydro, and biomass resources to satisfy their domestic demand and to export it. To do so, Colombia published the National Hydrogen Roadmap, in which green H2 was prioritized. This study estimates Colombia's potential to produce green H2 and a timeline of scenarios displaying the required installed capacity, capital investment, and environmental analysis related to water utilization and CO2 capture. Accordingly, Colombia can produce H2 at a rate of 9 Mt/a by 2050 by installing 121 GW renewables while processing 303 Mt/a of residual biomass. In this scenario, Colombia's share of the H2 international market can reach 1.2\%, with a cumulative investment of over 244 billion USD by 2050. This study provides insights into potential global resources for low-carbon H2 generation. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - Spatial distribution characteristics and interaction effects of DOM and microbial communities in kelp cultivation areas
AB  - The influence of macroalgae cultivation on aquaculture carbon sinks is significant, with microbial carbon (C) pumps contributing to a stable inert dissolved carbon pool in this context. Concurrently, dissolved organic matter (DOM) exchange at the marine sediment-water interface profoundly affects global ecosystem element cycling. However, the interactions between DOM and bacterial communities at the sediment-water interface in kelp cultivation areas, especially regarding microbial function prediction, have not been fully explored. This study analyzed the DOM characteristics, environmental factors, and bacterial community structure in the Tahewan kelpâ€”â€”Saccharina japonica cultivated area and compared them with those in non-cultivated areas. The results indicated significantly higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in the kelp culture area, particularly in surface seawater and overlying water. The dominant bacterial phyla in both regions included Pseudomonadota, Actinomycetota, and Bacteroidota in both regions, while Desulfobacterota was more prevalent in the sediment environment of the cultivated region. Parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) was used to identify DOM components, among which component C2 (a microbial humic-like substance DOM) was highly resistant to microbial degradation. We infer that C2 has similar properties to recalcitrant dissolved organic matter (RDOM). Analysis of the predicted functional genes based on 16S rRNA gene data showed that methanol oxidation, methylotrophy, and methanotrophy were significant in the bottom seawater of the cultivation area. The carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) cycle functional genes in the sediment environment of the kelp cultivation area were more active than those in other areas, especially in which sulfate reduction and denitrification were the two main processes. Furthermore, a DOM priming effect was identified in the cultivated sediment environment, where kelp-released labile dissolved organic matter (LDOM) stimulates rapid degradation of the original RDOM, potentially enhancing C sequestration.

TI  - Thermo-environmental multi- investigation and ANN-based optimization of a novel heat integration criteria system integrated with a marine engine generating liquefied hydrogen

A potential solution for alternative applications involves implementing combined heat integration, thereby enabling the production of additional utilities and mitigating emissions. The current work introduces an innovative heat integration process for a marine engine, focusing on implementing an optimal thermal matching technique to minimize overall irreversibility in producing liquefied hydrogen and coolant. The process incorporates an organic flash-bi-evaporator cooling cycle, a humidification dehumidification desalination, a polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis process, and a Claude cycle. The generated freshwater is delivered to the electrolyzer to produce gaseous hydrogen. This product and the cooling for freezing are utilized in the Claude cycle for hydrogen liquefaction.

TI  - Carbon emission allocation policy making in liner shipping: A novel approach toward equitable and efficient maritime sustainability
AB  - Maritime shipping, an integral component of global trade, accounts for nearly 3\% of global carbon dioxide emissions and faces significant challenges in mitigating its carbon footprints. This study addresses the shortcomings of current carbon emission surcharges levied by shipping companies and the deficiencies of allocation methods utilized by the government, such as the inequity of uniform carbon emission charges across diverse origin-destination (od) pairs and the reliance on potentially inaccurate self-reported emissions data to assign carbon emission allowances. We propose a novel approach to carbon emission allocation per twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) container per od pair in liner shipping from the perspective of the government, aiming to enhance government oversight and minimize social costs. Leveraging a bi-level programming model, our research navigates the complex interplay between government regulatory objectives and shipping companies' operational decisions, identifying a socially optimal carbon allocation policy. Our approach introduces three innovative carbon allocation methods that advance beyond the traditional metric that typically focuses solely on emissions and cargo volume. Our first two innovative methods integrate shipping distances into the carbon allocation process, specifically considering both the actual traveling distance and the shortest sailing distance. Furthermore, we propose the third innovative ``harmonic distance,{''} which is a convex combination of the actual traveling distance and the shortest sailing distance. This measure effectively reflects both the operational realities and equity concerns associated with shipping services. Our findings reveal the effectiveness of utilizing the shortest sailing distance for carbon allocation per TEU per od pair, offering a straightforward, route-independent, and equitable solution. This approach diverges from current industrial practices, favoring a fairer emission allocation basis and balancing the interests of governments, shipping companies, and consumers. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of this method in minimizing total social costs and providing a viable path toward environmental sustainability and economic efficiency in liner shipping.

TI  - Stocks and Sources of Soil Carbon and Nitrogen in Non-Native Kandelia obovata Afforestation and Spartina alterniflora Invasion: A Case Study on Northern Margin Mangroves in the Subtropical Coastal Wetlands of China
AB  - For decades in China, carbon neutrality policies have spurred the establishment of northern margin mangroves as artificial blue carbon ecosystems. However, there has been limited research on the impact of plantation and invasion on the stocks and sources of soil carbon and nitrogen in rehabilitated coastal wetlands. Non-native Kandelia obovata afforestation began on Ximen Island, Zhejiang, China, where Spartina alterniflora invasion had also occurred decades ago. Soil cores were collected from both mangrove and salt marsh habitats with depths from 0 to 50 cm and were analyzed for total carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and the isotope of carbon and nitrogen in sediments. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in the TC, SOC, and C/N ratio between the K. obovata and the S. alterniflora, but there were significant differences in TN, isotope delta C-13, and delta N-15. The SOC content of both ecosystems in the 0-20 cm layer was significantly higher than that in the 30-50 cm layer. Our study has shown that the main sources of carbon and nitrogen for mangroves and salt marshes are different, especially under the impact of external factors, such as tidal waves and aquaculture. These findings provide insight into the ecological functioning of subtropical coastal wetlands and an understanding of the biogeochemical cycles of northern margin mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Binary Vapor Cycle for Waste Heat Recovery from Marine Engine Exhaust
AB  - The considerable energy waste in maritime transport and the need to obtain alternatives to reduce emissions of polluting gases are factors that have motivated the study of waste heat recovery systems for marine engines. The system studied herein relies on a binary vapor cycle that uses water for the topping cycle while three organic fluids were investigated for the bottoming cycle: R601a, R134a, and R22. Each of these belongs to a different category of fluid, namely, dry fluid, isentropic fluid, and wet fluid, respectively. Two engines of different ratings and two different pressures of the heat recovery steam generator have been considered for each engine. Various outlet pressures for the topping turbine, which is the most liable to erosion and corrosion due to wet steam, have been investigated. The maximum efficiency achieved for the waste heat recovery system peaked at 21\% while the maximum electric power accounted for 4.2\% of engine brake power. Therefore, the employment of a waste heat recovery system based on a binary cycle seems a promising alternative to harnessing heat from the exhaust gases of marine engines.

TI  - Exergy efficiency and EEXI analysis of a marine power plant at partial load conditions
AB  - Energy efficiency and environmental protection are becoming more important in the world. Almost 90\% of the world trade is carried by sea which makes energy efficiency very important for the maritime sector. Exergetic method is a powerful scientific tool for measuring energy efficiency. The ships are not always cruising at maximum load conditions. The situations such as narrow water passages, maneuvering, and, hoteling etc. are partial load conditions and the exergy loss in power systems reaches maximum values at these conditions. Besides the new IMO regulation forces the sector to reduce emissions through Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI) and one of the most popular solutions is Engine Power Limitation (EPL). In the literature there are limited studies investigating exergy efficiencies of partial load conditions of a marine power plant. In this article, the performance analyses of a combined power system in partial load conditions are carried out using exergy method. The considered partial load conditions are maximum-ahead, full-ahead, half-ahead, slow-ahead and dead-slow-ahead loads of the engine. The results show that, the exergy efficiency of the overall system is decreasing at lower load conditions. It is observed that the maximum exergy efficiency is 51.6\% which is reached at 96 rpm. The best condition considering both exergy efficiency and EEXI is 80 rpm of main engine. At slow-ahead and dead-slow-ahead conditions the exergy efficiency decreases to about 33\%.

TI  - The Impact of Offshore Photovoltaic Utilization on Resources and Environment Using Spatial Information Technology
AB  - In recent years, the rapid development of the photovoltaic (PV) industry has resulted in a saturation of research on onshore PV power plant construction. However, current studies on the impact of marine PVs on the marine environment remain limited and scarce. In order to facilitate the implementation of carbon reduction goals and promote the sustainable development of the offshore PV industry, this study analyzes the environmental impact of PV sea-use resources based on spatial information technology in the western part of Gaotang Island. The findings show that the MIKE21FM model provides relatively accurate simulations of tidal flow and tide level in the marine PV area. Flow velocity in the marine PV area exhibits a decreasing trend, with an average decrease ranging from 0.03 to 0.07 m/s. This decrease minimally affects surrounding navigational channels and large-scale flow fields. The resulting siltation is also deemed less significant, with an annual deposition from 0.03 to 0.06 m/a. Moreover, offshore PV construction resulted in a total intertidal biological loss of 123.45 t. The suspension of sediment during cofferdam construction and removal has a potential effect on zooplankton and fishery resources. Overall, it is proposed that careful planning, prudent site selection, and the execution of countermeasures during marine PV construction will combine to minimize the impact on the marine environment.

TI  - Performance Analysis Based on Fuel Valve Train Control Optimization of Ammonia-Fuel Ships
AB  - In order to reduce carbon emissions, which are currently a problem in the shipping and offshore plant sectors, the international community is strengthening regulations such as the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI). To cope with this, eco-friendly fuel propulsion technology is being developed, and the development of an ammonia fuel supply system is in progress. Among them, fuel valve train (FVT) technology was researched for the final supply and cutoff of fuel and purging through nitrogen for ammonia engines. In this paper, we analyzed the change in ammonia supply due to FVT opening and the change in nitrogen supply due to closure. In addition, a plan to minimize risk factors was presented by applying a control method to remove residual fuel in FVT. According to the presented FVT model, the difference in the flow rate of supplied fuel was as much as 17.8 kg/s. Additionally, by opening the gas bleed valve at intervals during the closing process and purging about 0.28 kg of nitrogen, the internal fuel could be completely discharged. This is expected to have an impact on improving the marine environment through the application of eco-friendly fuels and the development of fuel supply system technology. Â© 2024 by the authors.

TI  - Alternative Fuels in Sustainable Logistics-Applications, Challenges, and Solutions
AB  - Logistics is becoming more cost competitive while customers and regulatory bodies pressure businesses to disclose their carbon footprints, creating interest in alternative fuels as a decarbonization strategy. This paper provides a thematic review of the role of alternative fuels in sustainable air, land, and sea logistics, their challenges, and potential mitigations. Through an extensive literature survey, we determined that biofuels, synthetic kerosene, natural gas, ammonia, alcohols, hydrogen, and electricity are the primary alternative fuels of interest in terms of environmental sustainability and techno-economic feasibility. In air logistics, synthetic kerosene from hydrogenated esters and fatty acids is the most promising route due to its high technical maturity, although it is limited by biomass sourcing. Electrical vehicles are favorable in road logistics due to cheaper green power and efficient vehicle designs, although they are constrained by recharging infrastructure deployment. In sea logistics, liquified natural gas is advantageous owing to its supply chain maturity, but it is limited by methane slip control and storage requirements. Overall, our examination indicates that alternative fuels will play a pivotal role in the logistics networks of the future.

TI  - CO2 Emissions from Blade Waste Treatments under Wind Power Scenario in Japan from 2021 to 2100
AB  - Wind power generation has been introduced to reduce carbon emissions; however, recycling or recovering the waste of wind blades, which contain fibre-reinforced plastic, is difficult. Converting the recovered materials for secondary use is also difficult owing to the decreased strength and low material value. Many countries, including Japan, have not considered the future energy and CO2 emission scenarios, particularly CO2 emissions from wind blade waste. Based on these scenarios, Japan has planned to introduce large amounts of onshore/offshore wind power generation through 2050. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate quantitatively the total amount of waste and the global warming potential (GWP) from multiple blade waste treatment processes. Based on the average lifetime of blades (20-25 years), we found that the GWP of wind blade waste treatment in Japan may reach a maximum of 197.3-232.4 MtCO(2)eq by 2060-2065. Based on this lifetime, the wind blade treatment in 2050 accounted for 63.9-80.1\% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in 2050. We also showed that the rise in CO2 emissions from the wind blade wastes would make up 82.5-93.6\% of the potential reduction in the GWP, which is achievable by shifting from thermal to wind power generation.

TI  - Assessing sediment CO2 effluxes in the coastal ecosystem of North Sumatra, Indonesia
AB  - Coastal wetlands including mangrove play a vital role in regulating the local and global carbon cycle. Coastal areas contribute greatly to the carbon exchange process due to the complex interactions that occur between the atmosphere, land, and oceans. One of the important components in coastal carbon dynamics is CO2 gas exchange between soil, water and the atmosphere. This study aims to assess CO2 efflux across various land covers (namely natural mangrove, restored mangrove, and converted mangroves to oil palm and aquaculture pond) in the coastal areas of North Sumatra Province, and analyze the effect of sea tides and ebbs on the rate of CO2 efflux and their connection with the number and area of macrozoobenthos burrows. We applied direct sampling by using the static closed chamber method attached to portable CO2 analyzer. The mean of CO2 efflux in natural mangrove forest land covers was 866 +/- 585 mgCO(2)/m(2)/h during low tide conditions and 1137 +/- 792 mgCO(2)/m(2)/h during high tide conditions, followed by oil palm plantations at 760.71 +/- 341 mgCO(2)/m(2)/h, restored mangroves during low tide of 575.24 +/- 326 mgCO(2)/m(2)/h and 597.11 +/- 180 mg CO2/m(2)/h during high tide conditions, and the lowest was recorded in ponds at 588.55 +/- 358 mgCO(2)/m(2)/h. Further, we observed that tidal conditions affect the magnitudes of CO2 efflux in natural and restored mangrove forests, and we did not observe similar pattern in oil palms and ponds since these land covers were not influenced by regular tidal input. We also observed that no significant relationship between the number and area of macrozoobenthos burrows and CO2 efflux. Our findings suggest that CO2 effluxes in coastal wetlands are highly dynamic and presumably driven by complex factors and therefore, understanding their magnitudes and drivers requires extensive measurement covering large spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Re-discovering macerating Posidonia oceanica bottoms: Characterization of meiofaunal community inhabiting a peculiar Mediterranean habitat
AB  - The highly efficient carbon storage capacity of beds formed by Posidonia oceanica, an endemic Mediterranean seagrass species, has been widely recognized. Recently, the supra-littoral deposits of leaf litter (i.e., banquettes) have been investigated in terms of their nutrients, biomass and associated community. Nevertheless, an overlooked fraction of the P. oceanica detritus never reaches the shore and sinks far away to deeper seafloor. Additionally, part of the supra-littoral deposit goes back to the sea during winter swells. This deep detrital compartment, mainly composed of sediment mixed with dead leaves and rhizomes coming from P. oceanica beds, has only been described once by Pe`res in 1953, who focused on the macrofaunal component. Here, we investigated for the first time the meiofaunal community inhabiting sediments characterized by P. oceanica detritus in a deposit located at 65-80 m depth off the Ischia Island (Gulf of Naples, Italy, Tyrrhenian Sea). Our results show that the meiofaunal community appears highly diversified and strongly dominated by nematodes (from 85\% to 93\%). Differences in meiobenthic assemblage structures were significant only when rare taxa were considered (i. e. taxa found in low abundances and characterized by a sporadic distribution in the study area). The nematode community revealed a very high biodiversity (number of families and genera: 31 and 104, respectively), with a clear prevalence of selective and non-selective deposit feeders that suggest the key role of this habitat in the benthic detrital food web. The richness of meiofauna and the taxonomic and functional diversity of the nematode assemblages account for a ``good{''} to ``moderate{''} ecological quality status. These findings support the high ecological value of the macerating seagrass bottoms, an overlooked component of the blue carbon cycle that deserves to be further investigated.

TI  - Seasonal gross primary production in response to environmental drivers from arid mangroves in the Gulf of California
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems provide multiple services, because of their Carbon (C) storage capacity they are recognized as blue carbon ecosystems. Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is an important component of the C cycle, however is challenging to measure at multiple time and spatial scales, providing opportunity for novel and practical research using remote sensing. In northwestern Mexico mangroves find their northern most distribution in Sonora, were the North American Monsoon System that occurs from June to September is an important driver of ecosystem processes. The aim of this research was to changes of GPP at ``Estero El Sargento{''} using remote sensing (MOD17A2H V6) and modeling (SPL4CMDL) products, and further explore environ-mental drivers that influence such change, for a period of three-year period (2014-2016). Our results show that in this mangrove site, GPP was not limited by precipitation, producing high values during the Pre-Monsoon season (385-490 gC m-2) than in the Monsoon season (260-311 gC m-2). Furthermore, high tide conditions, air temperature (T), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) strongly drive GPP during the Monsoon (r2 = 0.4) and Post Monsoon (r2 = 0.6) seasonswhich was not the case for the Pre-Monsoon season. There is a clear seasonality that influences ecosystem processes, with T and VPD being the most relevant environmental drivers. The increase in T and VPD limits GPP, which is of vital importance under the current climate change conditions. This type of studies is important to the Comcaac (Seri) Nation especially with their ongoing conservation efforts.

TI  - Optimal Design of a Renewable-Energy-Driven Integrated Cooling-Freshwater Cogeneration System
AB  - This study presents a novel approach that will address escalating demands for water and cooling in regions vulnerable to climate change through the proposal of an optimal integrated cooling-freshwater cogeneration system powered by renewable energy sources. Comprising three subsystems (integrated multi-effect evaporation distillation, absorption heat pump, and vapor compression refrigeration (MAV); renewable energy unit incorporating solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and hydrogen facilities (RHP/BH); and combined heat and power (CHP)), the system aims to produce both cooling and freshwater. By recovering cooling from combined desalination and refrigeration subsystems to chill the air taken into the gas turbine compressor, the system maximizes efficiency. Through the recovery of waste heat and employing an integrated thermo-environ-economic framework, a novel objective function, termed modified total annual cost (MTAC), is introduced for optimization. Using a genetic algorithm, parametric iterative optimization minimizes the MTAC. The results reveal that under optimum conditions, the MAV, RHP/BH, and CHP subsystems account for 67\%, 58\%, and 100\% of total annual, exergy destruction, and environmental costs, respectively. Notably, the system exhibits lower sensitivity to fuel prices than renewable energy sources, suggesting a need for future research that will incorporate dynamic product prices and greater fuel consumption to produce enhanced operational robustness.

TI  - The decarbonisation of the maritime sector: Horizon 2050
AB  - The decarbonisation of the maritime sector is one of the world's priorities to reduce the volume of polluting emissions. The basis of this decarbonisation is the adaptation of existing ships to emission control regulations by means of transformations, installation of new equipment, development of new low -emission fuels and development of the infrastructure that makes the supply of this new generation of fuels feasible. In addition, hydrogen is the energy vector for all these new technologies, and its role over the next 30 years needs to be addressed. In a changing global situation such as the one we are currently experiencing; this article has the objective of making a review paper on the different fuels currently being used in the maritime sector and the existing alternatives. It also discusses the situation and the impact the current environmental situation has on the world ship order book, both in terms of legislation and economics. As a conclusion, the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) will have a very important role to play as a bridge between the current situation and the development of hydrogen technology. Hydrogen is an energy vector that can achieve the decarbonisation objectives by 2050. Storage problems, lack of infrastructures to supply it and the development of technology and regulations are the major challenges it will have to face. Biofuels also present a serious proposal for the decarbonisation of the sector, and the role of hydrogen in their composition, is essential to achieve green fuel generation.

TI  - Improving soil carbon estimates of Philippine mangroves using localized organic matter to organic carbon equations
AB  - BackgroundSoutheast Asian (SEA) mangroves are globally recognized as blue carbon hotspots. Methodologies that measure mangrove soil carbon stock (SCS) are either accurate but costly (i.e., elemental analyzers), or economical but less accurate (i.e., loss-on-ignition {[}LOI]). Most SEA countries estimate SCS by measuring soil organic matter (OM) through the LOI method then converting it into organic carbon (OC) using a conventional conversion equation (\%Corg = 0.415 {*} \% LOI + 2.89, R2 = 0.59, n = 78) developed from Palau mangroves. The local site conditions in Palau does not reflect the wide range of environmental settings and disturbances in the Philippines. Consequently, the conventional conversion equation possibly compounds the inaccuracies of converting OM to OC causing over- or under-estimated SCS. Here, we generated a localized OM-OC conversion equation and tested its accuracy in computing SCS against the conventional equation. The localized equation was generated by plotting \% OC (from elemental analyzer) against the \% OM (from LOI). The study was conducted in different mangrove stands (natural, restored, and mangrove-recolonized fishponds) in Oriental Mindoro and Sorsogon, Philippines from the West and North Philippine Sea biogeographic regions, respectively. The OM:OC ratios were also statistically tested based on (a) stand types, (b) among natural stands, and (c) across different ages of the restored and recolonized stands. Increasing the accuracy of OM-OC conversion equations will improve SCS estimates that will yield reasonable C emission reduction targets for the country's commitments on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.ResultsThe localized conversion equation is \%OC = 0.36 {*} \% LOI + 2.40 (R2 = 0.67; n = 458). The SOM:OC ratios showed significant differences based on stand types (x2 = 19.24; P = 6.63 x 10-05), among natural stands (F = 23.22; p = 1.17 x 10-08), and among ages of restored (F = 5.14; P = 0.03) and recolonized stands (F = 3.4; P = 0.02). SCS estimates using the localized (5\%) and stand-specific equations (7\%) were similar with the values derived from an elemental analyzer. In contrast, the conventional equation overestimates SCS by 20\%.ConclusionsThe calculated SCS improves as the conversion equation becomes more reflective of localized site conditions. Both localized and stand-specific conversion equations yielded more accurate SCS compared to the conventional equation. While our study explored only two out of the six marine biogeographic regions in the Philippines, we proved that having a localized conversion equation leads to improved SCS measurements. Using our proposed equations will make more realistic SCS targets (and therefore GHG reductions) in designing mangrove restoration programs to achieve the country's NDC commitments.

TI  - Optimization of design and operational parameters of hybrid MED-RO desalination system via modelling, simulation and engineering application
AB  - Based on the current research, the hybridization of desalination technologies has proven to be an effective method of enhancing system performance, minimizing energy consumption, and reducing product water cost. This study focuses on a hybrid MED-RO desalination plant in a large coastal steel enterprise situated in Northeast Asia, China. A comparative analysis of distinct hybrid systems was undertaken, followed by the selection of an optimal process route that aligns with the site-specific conditions and the requirements of downstream freshwater users. To investigate the influences of feed and operational factors on RO process performance, mathematical models were developed for water balance, RO module performance, energy consumption, and economic indicators. Furthermore, according to actual plant conditions, the software simulation and cost benefit analysis were performed for the hybrid desalination system sensitivity analysis and optimization. The outcomes including permeate qualities, concentrate salinity, specific energy consumption, and economic indicators were analyzed to achieve the optimal hybrid system design and operational parameters. Finally, through engineering application of the optimized parameters, the hybrid system performance underwent notable improvement. The calculations reveal that, in comparison to standalone or alternative hybrid systems, this hybrid system exhibits superior energy-saving efficiency, lower operational costs, and reduced carbon emissions. Specifically, the system achieves a recovery rate of approximately 54.22 \%, with an average product water cost of 0.5582 US\$/m3. Additionally, the energy consumption is 1.015 kgce/m3, translating to an equivalent carbon emission of 2.49 kg/m3.

TI  - Valorization of marine fishmeal industry oil as feedstock and calcined shrimp and crab shells as catalysts for production of biodiesels and evaluation of their fuel properties, engine combustion, performance and gas emission characteristics
AB  - The current investigation aims on valorization of marine fishmeal industry oil as alternate feedstock for biodiesel production using waste crustacean shell derived catalysts such as calcined shrimp shell (SSBD) at 1:12 oil-tomethanol molar ratio, 5 wt\% catalyst dosage, 65 degrees C temperature, and 120 min reaction time and calcined crab shell (CSBD) at 1:9 oil-to-methanol molar ratio, 3 wt\% catalyst concentration, 60 degrees C temperature and 60 min time, and validate their authenticity for application in diesel engine by evaluating engine performance, combustion, and gas emission characteristics. The SSBD and CSBD yield of 88.74 wt\% and 87.47 wt\% was obtained at 50 L biodiesel production. The fuel properties of SSBD and CSBD blends (B5, B20, and B50) ensured their application in diesel engine. The brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency values for all SSBD and CSBD blends didn't exhibit major deviation than diesel at 11.93 kW engine load, and ranged from 0.23 to 0.25 kg/kWh and 31.58-36.17\%, respectively. Among all blends, the B50 blend of SSBD and CSBD reduced CO, CO2, and HC emissions up to 74.72\% and 86.81\%, 13.11\% and 16.63\%, and 35.09\% and 58.54\%, respectively. Overall, SSBD and CSBD produced using alternate novel feedstock and catalyst could pave way to meet energy demand and sustainable biodiesel production.

TI  - System Strength Reduction in an Island Grid through Transitioning to 100\% Inverter-Based Resources
AB  - Puerto Rico, an island heavily reliant on fossil fuels for primary electricity generation, faces challenges stemming from inadequate preventative maintenance, leading to an intermittently insufficient generation mix to meet overall load demand. Media coverage, exemplified by the Department of Energy PR100 study, delineates a strategic roadmap for transitioning Puerto Rico to achieve 100\% renewable energy generation. This shift aims not only to mitigate dependence on fossil fuels but also to replace outdated conventional plants. Integrating inverter-interfaced renewable generation into the grid introduces a challenge, as these resources cannot match the short-circuit levels typically supplied by rotational synchronous generation. Complexity arises in determining whether existing protection schemes can maintain dependability during this transition or whether upgrades, such as adjustments to protection settings or philosophical enhancements, are imperative. This paper addresses this challenge by evaluating system strength at different stages of incorporating utility-scale renewable shares in the island system. It discerns the reduction in short-circuit currents for both three-phase faults and single-line-to-ground faults as conventional plants are phased out in favor of inverter-based resources. This research work also quantifies the impact of synchronous condensers and STATCOMs as a solution to strengthen the grid and increase short-circuit levels. This research equips the transmission operator with valuable insights into the necessary future system modifications to ensure the dependability and safety of the grid.

TI  - Mission profile oriented energy efficiency and CO2 footprint assessment of naval vessels at conceptual design phase: A comparative case study of conventional and hybrid energy systems
AB  - CO2 is the main green house gas (GHG) produced in fossil fuel burning engines on ships. The growth of activities of sea-going vessels, have been increasing interest and concerns over ship-born CO2 emissions. Consequently, numerous studies have been introduced for emission estimation. Each estimation approach has its own assumptions, thus uncertainty with data of vessel activities, vessel attributes, and calculating methods. The conceptual design phase is the first phase of ship design. One of the issues addressed at this phase is the assessment of energy system alternatives of relevant ship. A ship energy system provides propulsion and electrical power. The assessment of energy system alternatives for a naval vessel is a very complicated business that has a significant impact and interaction on overall vessel integration. Naval vessels and their energy systems constitute a noteworthy part of the total world ship fleet. The present study aims to present a realistic methodology for estimating efficiency, hence CO2 emissions, for candidate energy systems of surface vessels at conceptual design phase. A frigate is selected as the case (baseline) vessel. Three energy systems, namely CODAD, CODOG, and CODLOG-CC, are proposed as alternatives for the case vessel. Instead of general emission estimation approaches, the present study proposes a mission profile-oriented estimation methodology which provides more precise and accurate results. The Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) defines efficiency and sets limitation during design and construction of specific merchant vessels, but since this index does not comply with unique characteristics of mission profile of surface vessels, the novel efficiency design index defined as integral warship EEDI (IWEEDI) is implemented for the case vessel. According to the analysis, CODAD is found to be the most efficient alternative, followed by CODLOG-CC and CODOG, respectively.

TI  - Impacts of hydropeaking: A systematic review
AB  - Hydropower is commonly considered a renewable energy source. Nevertheless, this does not imply an absence of impacts on the riverine ecosystem, the extent of which is expected to increase in the coming years due to the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources and for the climate change. A common consequence of hydroelectric power generation is hydropeaking, which causes rapid and frequent fluctuations in the water flow downstream of hydropower plants. The review incorporates 155 relevant studies published up until November 2023 and follows a systematic review method, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), which is a multi-stage systematic procedure for the identification and selection of research documents. The selected studies highlighted several prominent impacts of hydropeaking on aquatic environments. The primary effects include alterations in flow patterns, modification of water temperature, changes in sediment dynamics and fluctuations in dissolved gas levels. These alterations have been found to affect various aspects of aquatic ecosystems, including fish growth, behavior, reproductive success, habitat, and migration patterns, and benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Furthermore, hydropeaking can also lead to habitat fragmentation, erosion, and loss of riparian vegetation, thereby impacting terrestrial ecosystems that depend on the aquatic environment. Despite the body of literature reviewed, several knowledge gaps were identified, underscoring the need for further research. There is limited understanding of the long-term ecological consequences of hydropeaking and its cumulative effects on aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, there is lack of consensus regarding the quantification of ecosystem services, economic impact, soil moisture content, and weighted usable area due to flow fluctuation and global evolution of energy production from renewable energy sources. Addressing the identified research gaps is crucial for achieving a balance between energy production and the conservation of freshwater ecosystems in the context of a rapidly changing global climate.

TI  - Energy and exergy analysis of a novel solar-powered passive multi-stage osmosis desalination system for sustainable water production
AB  - Climate change and population growth constantly exacerbate global water scarcity, and seawater desalination technology is crucial to addressing this crisis. Conventional fossil-fuel desalination poses environmental and economic challenges, especially in remote, water-scarce regions. Renewable energy offers sustainable options for seawater desalination; however, most related technologies face challenges in flexible deployment. Among passive technologies, interfacial evaporation still confronts issues of salt accumulation impacting desalination efficiency. Therefore, this study investigates a novel solar-powered passive multi-stage osmosis device that emulates mangroves' transpiration and natural osmosis processes. Harnessing solar energy, it employs hydrophilic nanoporous membranes for water movement and evaporation and an osmosis membrane for solute retention, aiming for efficient seawater desalination without external power and pressure. Energy and exergy analyses reveal key efficiency factors. Results reveal significant pressure gradients across the osmosis membrane as a challenge. Optimizing salinity and adjusting the area ratio of the nanoporous membrane to the osmosis membrane is vital for stability and performance. Moreover, potential increases in water production from 0.97 kg/ m(2)/h to 3.53 kg/m(2)/h with a five-stage setup, though benefits diminish with additional stages due to heat/ exergy losses. The exergy efficiency increases from 0.14 \% for a five-stage device to 0.18 \% for a ten-stage system. This study demonstrates the solar-powered passive multi-stage osmosis device's dependence on solar flux and highlights the importance of optimizing the air gap thickness and insulation to boost efficiency.

TI  - Techno-economic analysis of implementing pumped hydro energy storage to store solar and wind energy in water-stressed areas
AB  - As the world transitions from fossil fuels, solar and wind energy have become top renewable and cost-effective alternatives. However, their sporadic nature requires a form of energy storage that is both large-scale and affordable. Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS), despite being the global leader in energy storage, requires substantial amounts of fresh water. This poses a challenge in arid regions, as using seawater would lead to high operational costs. We present a techno-economic analysis of implementing Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) for storing solar and wind energy, particularly in water-stressed areas. The study first explores the economics and operations of different electricity storage and generation methods, emphasizing the viability of Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS) for large-scale energy storage. It assesses the costs and availability of various electric energy sources, particularly solar and wind, and underscores their seasonal fluctuations. An example of optimizing a PHS system for efficient storage and use of solar and wind energies is presented. An analysis comparing solar and wind energy inputs to total electricity consumption is conducted, and the parameters for PHS sizing are established. Two optimization problems, Design A and Design B, are introduced to minimize seasonal energy storage and exportable energy fraction, respectively. The daily storage capacity considerations for the PHS system are discussed, and a comparison of the annual performances of Design A and Design B is provided. The cost estimates for the current energy mix (with an average LCOE of $42.52/MWh for California) and the proposed 100 % solar + wind with PHS energy cluster (Design A results in 9 % annual saving with an average LCOE of $38.69/MWh) are also included. The paper also discusses the water requirements and their cost impact on PHS systems, exploring various options for supplying water to PHS systems in water-scarce areas. For water-stressed countries like Saudi Arabia, seawater desalination using renewable energy is suggested as the best option for implementing PHS, provided there is no environmental damage caused by the brine reject. Other options include harvesting seasonal rainwater and using suitably treated wastewater. The PHS reservoirs should be deep enough (at least 9 m for minimum elevation difference of 150 m) to limit water loss due to evaporation. Finally, the study suggests that the relatively high cost of PHS in the energy mix may be reduced by multi-purposing and shared use of the PHS system. PHS systems could serve secondary purposes such as providing high power electricity on demand for Electric Vehicles (EV) supercharging, providing stability to the electrical grid, and serving as tourist attractions. The extra water produced could also be put to multiple uses or sold to increase the revenues. Â© 2024 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Maritime law enforcement concerning offshore energy platforms: Navigating international law constraints and challenges
AB  - Offshore energy platforms (OEPs) serve as a crucial frontier in utilizing renewable energy sources to meet energy demands, powering essential maritime operations such as remote island power supply, offshore oil and gas exploration, seawater desalination, and marine renewable energy harvesting. However, the development of OEPs raises significant legal concerns for maritime law enforcement. Employing a policy analysis approach, this research delves into the multifaceted challenges faced by the current international legal framework in regulating enforcement activities pertaining to OEPs. These challenges encompass ambiguity in OEP legal status, difficulties in balancing safety measures with diverse maritime interests, obstacles in environmental assessment and enforcement, and heightened enforcement challenges in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The study explores potential strategies for resolution and collaboration on an international scale. Through this investigation, the study aims to provide valuable insights to promote greater clarity and coherence in maritime law enforcement practices concerning OEPs, thereby enhancing safety, security, and environmental sustainability for OEP operations in maritime environments globally.

TI  - A Global Marine Sediment Compilation and a Cerium Anomaly Perspective on Metasomatized Mantle Sources for REE-Mineralized Carbonatites
AB  - Rare earth elements (REE) are vital for powerful permanent magnets used in electric motors and wind turbines. These elements are chiefly sourced from carbonatites and their weathering products. The economic attractiveness of carbonatites is explained by the 10,000-fold enrichment of REE in their mineralized portions relative to the average continental crust. Carbonatites form from mantle-derived melts, but the ultimate origin of their REE is not completely clear. One widely cited model invokes subduction of marine sediments which accumulate REE-rich material, priming the mantle to produce REE-rich carbonatite melts which subsequently form deposits in the upper crust. Here we examine a global marine sediment compilation, revealing a wide variety in REE abundances and patterns. We use the sensitive lambda method that separates REE pattern curvature from redox-related element anomalies to examine both marine sediments and presumably derived carbonatite rocks. We find that the most REE-rich marine sediments are characterized by strongly negative Ce anomalies, which if recycled via subduction, mineralized carbonatites are expected to inherit. In contrast, we find that mineralized carbonatite rocks do not contain Ce anomalies. This indicates that the REE from the most REE-rich marine sediments are not recycled into carbonatite deposits, and a different REE source is needed to explain carbonatite fertilities. We also find evidence that raises questions on whether any sediment-derived REE are present in carbonatite deposits to a significant amount. We suggest that a REE-rich source may not be required and REE enrichment occurs primarily during crustal magmatic differentiation. Rare earth elements (REE) such as neodymium are important components of permanent magnets used in energy generation technologies including wind power turbines and electric motors. These metals are extracted from carbonatite rocks, but how the REE got to carbonatites in the first place is contentious. The seafloor contains accumulations of exceptionally REE-rich sediments, and a popular model proposes that these REE are recycled to the mantle during subduction. Once melting occurs in the mantle, these same REE are suggested to be transported in the carbonatite melts and eventually reach the upper crust where they contribute to economic mineralization. However, the REE-rich sediments contain a ubiquitous chemical signature in the form of a redox-sensitive negative cerium anomaly. We show that the anomaly does not occur in carbonatite rocks, with the implication that recycled REE-rich sediments cannot necessarily be the source for carbonatite-related ore deposits. Subducted REE-rich sediments with negative Ce anomalies are thought to supply carbonatites with their REE Carbonatites have no statistically significant negative Ce anomaly Recycling of particularly REE-rich marine sediments not required for mineralization

TI  - Assessing the Benefits and Challenges of Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) for Atlantic Salmon Production
AB  - Land-based recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are used routinely for rearing juvenile Atlantic salmon in freshwater (to seawater-tolerant smolts). These systems potentially also offer a promising alternative to sea pen farming of Atlantic salmon in the drive to satisfy increasing global market demands and reduce pressures on marine fisheries and ecosystems. Several technological challenges need to be overcome and key knowledge gaps addressed to realize the potential of seawater RAS for post-smolt grow-out. Firstly, seawater RAS requires cost-effective technological solutions for maintaining the quality of recirculating seawater and treating and disposing of high-salinity wastewater. Technology within RAS also needs to cater for the different physiological requirements of distinct life stages of Atlantic salmon (from eggs to table-ready fish), to maximize fish welfare and growth, and to ensure high product quality. In this review we draw attention to interacting physical, chemical and biological components of RAS, which need to be managed systemically when optimizing and maintaining freshwater and seawater aquaculture systems. We then briefly review published local- to global-scale sustainability indicators, quantified through life-cycle analysis (LCA), to facilitate comparisons between lanf-based RAS and sea-based closed containment aquaculture systems. Existing `cradle to gate' LCAs focus on production efficiency, energy consumption and carbon accounting, and call into question the sustainability of geographically extensive production of Atlantic salmon using RAS, for example in hot, dry climates. These LCAs, however, often do not account for major benefits of RAS, including reduced food miles (to market), the removal of direct environmental threats to farmed salmon (including from sea lice) and reciprocal risks to marine ecosystems from sea pen farming. We conclude that judgements on the efficiency and sustainability of RAS, compared to other farming methods, for upscaling Atlantic salmon production to meet rising global demands need to be assessed more holistically, adopting systems-wide approaches.

TI  - LPG, Gasoline, and Diesel Engines for Small Marine Vessels: A Comparative Analysis of Eco-Friendliness and Economic Feasibility
AB  - As an escalating global concern for environmentally sustainable marine fuels, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is attracting attention as an eco-friendly and economical alternative. This study explored LPG utilization in small marine vessels, focusing on its eco-friendliness and economic feasibility. To assess its environmental implications, the AVL FIRE simulation program was used to compare CO2, CO, NO, and soot emissions from LPG engines with those from conventional gasoline and diesel engines. The LPG engine model relied on data from a pioneering type-approved experimental LPG engine designed for small South Korean marine vessels, while parameters for gasoline and diesel engines were adjusted to suit their distinctive features. Regarding long-term economic feasibility, assuming a 30-year ship lifespan, incorporating 2022 annual average prices, average annual price growth rates, and annual fuel consumption data of each fuel, results indicate that LPG engines exhibited lower CO2, CO, NO, and soot emissions than conventional engines, except that NO emissions were higher than gasoline engines. Evaluating LPG's economic feasibility over a 30-year ship life cycle for an individual vessel revealed varying fuel cost savings, with the greatest savings observed in gasoline-other (KRW 2220.7 million) and the least in gasoline-coastal (KRW 1152.5 million). These findings offer vital insights for ship operators and policymakers seeking a balance between eco-friendliness and cost-effectiveness, as well as LPG engine technology emerging as pivotal for a sustainable future, harmonizing environmental protection and economic viability.

TI  - Black Start of Coastline Power Networks From Grid-Forming Ship-to-Grid Services
AB  - The expansion of electric ships in the transportation sector, along with environmental advantages, has the potential to enhance the resilience and stability of coastline power grids during blackouts or emergencies through ship-to-grid technology. The power grids located in remote coastal and island communities often face high energy costs and are more vulnerable to blackouts due to their increased risk of natural disasters. Ship-to-grid technology offers an innovative localized solution that enables onshore utilities to avoid the need for installing excessive on-land energy storage capacity to enhance stability and resiliency in the coastline power grid. Electric ships can provide a flexible source to restart power to critical facilities such as hospitals and communication networks. In this paper, a comprehensive scheme for integrating ships into the grid system is proposed, which involves a grid-forming control approach through a DC-link connection. The approach employs a droop-based control strategy, current limiter control, and voltage source grid interface to regulate both voltage and frequency at various stages of the coastline power network restoration. The approach is verified using a 4-zone shipboard power system with grid-forming DC-link connection, for black start of a modified IEEE 30-bus test system during a multi-step black start and re-energization process.

TI  - Grid-based assessment of hydrogen leakages for an offshore process to improve the design and human performance
AB  - Hydrogen is gaining global recognition as a sustainable energy source, but its combustible nature raises concerns, especially in congested offshore settings. Steam methane reforming (SMR) remains the predominant hydrogen production method; however, offshore SMR facilities exposed to harsh weather could potentially compromise safety because of leakages. This study uses the fire dynamics simulator (FDS) to carry out the first-of-its-kind CFD modeling of hydrogen leakage and its wind-influenced dispersion on an offshore SMR platform. It also provides the spatial risk that accounts for the probabilities of human errors and wind speeds. The study uses a grid-based approach with 120 monitor points (MPs) to measure locally dispersed gas concentration. At 2 m/s wind speed, only nine grids contain explosive concentrations while the rest remain safe. At 5 m/s, the flammable zones increase by 133\%, affecting 21 grids. Extreme wind speeds of 12.5 m/s have limited impact, but SMR1 exhibits higher stoichiometric concentrations. MPs 43-48 record flammable concentrations at all wind speeds; however, at 12.5 m/s the explosion risk is well below the threshold of 1 x 10-4 due to the low wind occurrence probability. Overall, this research contributes to addressing the safety concerns associated with hydrogen in offshore settings and provides a foundation for future risk assessments.

TI  - Utilization of Spent Coffee Grounds for Bioelectricity Generation in Sediment Microbial Fuel Cells
AB  - This study examined the utilization of spent coffee grounds with different aqueous extraction methods for the bioelectricity generation from coastal benthic sediment through a sediment microbial fuel cell (SMFC) system. Different methods for the aqueous extraction of SCGs were evaluated, including rinsing and drying of the SCG (SMFC-CRD), immersion, rinsing and drying (SMFC-CRID), drying alone (SMFC-CD), and untreated SCG (SMFC-C). The caffeine concentration in the SCG was significantly reduced using pretreatments, with SMFC-CRID achieving the lowest concentration of 0.021 +/- 0.001 mg/g. SMFC-CRD contributed to the generation of the highest current density of 213.7 mA/m2 during closed-circuit operation and exhibited the highest power density of 96.9 mW/m2 in the polarization test, due to the suitable caffeine content of 0.275 +/- 0.001 mg/g in the SCG. This study could provide a cost-effective method for reusing SCGs (i.e., 128 g) while generating bioelectricity as an alternative energy source. These results suggest that pretreatment with SCGs is essential for achieving optimal power density and reducing the caffeine concentration in the SMFC system.

TI  - Pollution Substitution? Scrubber Discharges and the Law of the Sea: An Essay in Honor of Ted L. McDorman
AB  - Compliance with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) 2020 sulphur oxides (SOx) emissions regulation requires using low sulphur content fuel or an alternative compliance mechanism certified by national administrations. The latter includes installation of an exhaust gas cleaning system (EGCS) to remove SOx prior to emission, which entails the discharge at sea of highly acidic washwater containing harmful substances, resulting in a new form of marine pollution. This article discusses how the certification and use of EGCS are incompatible with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provisions on the protection and preservation of the marine environment and explores regulatory strategies for IMO to remove the incompatibility.

TI  - Research on the legal system of economic-ecological synergistic compensation in carbon neutral marine cities with a background in big data
AB  - With the increasingly severe global carbon emissions problem and the serious threat ecosystems face, carbon neutrality has gradually attracted widespread attention. This study provides an in-depth analysis of practical cases of international carbon neutrality initiatives and relevant experiences of marine cities, focusing on the construction and implementation of a legal system for economic, ecologically coordinated compensation. To evaluate the actual effectiveness of the legal system in marine cities, this study used a multiple linear regression model, considering factors such as the strictness of the legal system, enforcement efforts, and the level of participation of local enterprises and residents. The research results indicate that carbon emissions have significantly decreased in cities where legal systems are effectively enforced, from an average of 1.5 million tons per year to 1 million tons. At the same time, the economic growth rate of these cities has also significantly improved, increasing by about 2.5 percentage points from the original annual average of 4 \% to 6.5 \%. The study also found that the biodiversity index of these cities increased by 15 \%, far higher than the average increase of 5 \% in other cities, indicating the positive role of legal systems in protecting biodiversity. The public's participation rate in environmental protection activities has also increased from 25 \% to 45 \%, and the growth rate of green investment has reached an average of 8 \% per year, far exceeding the 3 \% growth rate of other cities. In terms of the ecosystem, data shows that the distribution of the ecosystem is stable, with an average ecological index of 508, which is in a relatively ideal state. The annual average growth rate of ecosystem restoration is about 3.5 \%, further proving the effectiveness of ecological protection measures. Comprehensive empirical analysis shows that implementing the new legal system effectively reduces carbon emissions, enhances biodiversity, and promotes sustainable economic development. The economic growth rate increased from an average of 4.2 \% to 5.1 \% per year after implementing the new legal system, fully demonstrating the important role of the economic, ecologically coordinated compensation legal system in promoting carbon neutrality goals in marine cities.

The island lacks utility-scale power infrastructure, relying primarily on rooftop solar systems. Addressing the challenge of efficient energy utilization, the study analyses the Bhashanchar Community System's energy dynamics, load demand, and renewable energy integration feasibility. The primary objective is to design an optimised hybrid microgrid system to balance energy supply and demand, reducing blackout risks. A Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition based load management system is introduced for real-time energy distribution, enhancing reliability. The proposed off-grid hybrid microgrid system includes solar PV, wind, diesel, biomass, wind turbine, tidal turbine, and battery storage. It incorporates priority setting mechanisms to categorise energy sources by reliability, availability, and environmental impact, ensuring consistent, reliable, and sustainable energy supply. The study demonstrates that the proposed system can achieve significant energy savings, around 23%, compared to traditional models, showcasing the effectiveness of the hybrid microgrid approach in powering remote communities with limited conventional energy access.

TI  - Towards bioprocess engineering of cable bacteria: Establishment of a synthetic sediment
AB  - Cable bacteria, characterized by their multicellular filamentous growth, are prevalent in both freshwater and marine sediments. They possess the unique ability to transport electrons over distances of centimeters. Coupled with their capacity to fix CO2 and their record-breaking conductivity for biological materials, these bacteria present promising prospects for bioprocess engineering, including potential electrochemical applications. However, the cultivation of cable bacteria has been limited to their natural sediment, constraining their utility in production processes. To address this, our study designs synthetic sediment, drawing on ion exchange chromatography data from natural sediments and existing literature on the requirements of cable bacteria. We examined the effects of varying bentonite concentrations on water retention and the impacts of different sands. For the first time, we cultivated cable bacteria on synthetic sediment, specifically the freshwater strain Electronema aureum GS. This cultivation was conducted over 10 weeks in a specially developed sediment bioreactor, resulting in an increased density of cable bacteria in the sediment and growth up to a depth of 5 cm. The creation of this synthetic sediment paves the way for the reproducible cultivation of cable bacteria. It also opens up possibilities for future process scale-up using readily available components. This advancement holds significant implications for the broader field of bioprocess engineering.

TI  - Techno-Economic Evaluation of Direct Low-Pressure Selective Catalytic Reduction for Boil-Off Gas Treatment Systems of NH3-Fueled Ships
AB  - This study proposes a feasible solution for boil-off gas (BOG) treatment to facilitate NH3 fuel use by ocean-going ships, which is currently considered an alternative fuel for ships. Two systems were designed and analyzed for BOG in IMO Type-A NH3 fuel storage tanks for 14,000 TEU container ships. First, BOG lost inside the storage tank minimized economic losses through the onboard re-liquefaction system. The total energy consumed by the system to process NH3 gas generated in the fuel tank at 232.4 kg/h was 51.9 kW, and the specific energy consumption (SEC) was 0.223 kWh/kg. Second, NH3 was supplied to the direct Low-Pressure Selective Catalytic Reduction (LP-SCR) system to treat marine pollutants generated by combustion engines. The feasible design point was determined by calculating the NH3 feed flow rate using three methodologies. The energy consumed by the direct LP-SCR system was 3.89 and 2.39 kW, and the SEC was 0.0144 at 0.0167 kWh/kg at 100\% and 25\% load, respectively. The feasibility was indicated via economic analysis. Depending on the life cycle cost, the competitiveness of the re-liquefaction system depends on the price of NH3, where a higher price yields a more economical solution. In conclusion, the direct LP-SCR system has a low overall cost because of its low energy consumption when supplying NH3 and its reduced amount of core equipment.

TI  - A Review of CO2 Plume Dispersion Modeling for Application to Offshore Carbon Capture and Storage
AB  - The exponential increase in greenhouse gas emissions necessitates urgent measures to mitigate climate change impacts. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has emerged as a promising solution, capturing CO2 from industrial processes and storing it underground. However, CCS implementation poses risks that demand sophisticated modeling. This review focuses on the numerical modeling of CO2 plume dispersion from reservoir leaks during offshore CCS projects, including near- and far-field modeling and the comparison between Lagrangian and Eulerian modeling in particular. Near-field modeling examines CO2 behavior in jet plume, considering depth-related changes. Far-field modeling, employing Eulerian and Lagrangian methods, evaluates dispersion in marine environments. Case studies illustrate the complexity and uniqueness of CO2 dispersion events. The Lagrangian approach emphasizes gas bubble tracking, while the Eulerian approach employs fixed grid systems for detailed hydrodynamic modeling. Both approaches contribute valuable insights, with Eulerian models excelling in site-specific complexities and Lagrangian models offering computational efficiency. A hybrid approach may offer a comprehensive understanding of CO2 dispersion.

TI  - Dynamic Modeling and Stability Analysis of Marine Hybrid Power Systems With DC Grid: A Model-Based Design Approach
AB  - Marine power systems are exposed to conservative designs due to strict redundancy and reliability requirements. Moreover, the lack of standard models may hinder the development of green solutions, such as electrification and hybridization. This article proposes a model-based design approach for the stability-compliant development of emerging marine hybrid power systems (HPSs) with increasing application of dc grid, marine batteries, and all-electric propulsion. The proposed approach is established based on three main phases: model development for the power and propulsion system, analytical stability identification, and conceptual design and verification. First, a complete model of the multiphysics dynamical system is developed including the electro-mechanical sub-systems such as engine-generator sets, batteries, power electronics, and associated controllers. The physical and control sub-systems are modeled as building blocks in the state-space formulation. Then, an eigenvalue-based stability framework, namely, stability portrait, is developed to identify the border of system stability with respect to design parameters. Considering system boundaries, the border of stability is drawn with the variation of selected parameters such as filters, dc bus, and engine speed and loading. Selected design scenarios are then evaluated to reach a final conceptual design that ensures system stability while benefiting from the potential efficiency and flexibility of the hybrid system. The analytical models are validated with experimental data.

TI  - Self-powered wireless sensor node enabled by ultra-high-output swinging hybrid generator toward real-time and in-situ marine meteorological observations
AB  - With the intensification of global ocean exploration, there is an increasing need for extensive and dispersed wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to meet the requirements of real-time, in-situ, and high-spatial-temporaldensity marine meteorological observations. Nevertheless, providing a reliable power source and ensuring the ongoing maintenance of these WSNs pose significant challenges. Here, an innovative self-powered wireless sensor node is developed to address these challenges, featuring an ultra-high-output triboelectric-electromagnetic hybrid generator (T-EHG) with a swinging mechanism. The T-EHG, which combines triboelectric (TENG) and electromagnetic (EMG) generation, assisted by a universal power management system (UPMS), efficiently converts wave energy into a consistent voltage output between 1.5 V to 3.3 V. Additionally, the self-powered WSNs integrated with T-EHG, UPMS circuits, meteorological sensors, and microcontroller units (MCUs) with LoRa wireless transmission functionality are capable of executing data collection and transmission operations every 10 s under simulated wave conditions. These systems can achieve a maximum wireless transmission range of 1.5 km. Notably, a marine meteorological monitoring system utilizes these autonomous sensor nodes, along with base stations, cloud servers, and terminal devices to effectively implement real-time, on-site measurements of temperature, humidity, and air pressure within the monitored zone. This research underscores the substantial practical utility and extensive application prospects of these advanced self-powered WSNs for marine meteorological surveillance.

TI  - Feed Components and Timing to Improve the Feed Conversion Ratio for Sustainable Aquaculture Using Starch
AB  - Aquaculture contributes to the sustainable development of food security, marine resource conservation, and economy. Shifting aquaculture feed from fish meal and oil to terrestrial plant derivatives may result in cost savings. However, many carnivorous fish cannot be sustained on plant-derived materials, necessitating the need for the identification of important factors for farmed fish growth and the identification of whether components derived from terrestrial plants can be used in feed. Herein, we focused on the carnivorous fish leopard coral grouper (P. leopardus) to identify the essential growth factors and clarify their intake timing from feeds. Furthermore, we evaluated the functionality of starch, which are easily produced by terrestrial plants. Results reveal that carbohydrates, which are not considered essential for carnivorous fish, can be introduced as a major part of an artificial diet. The development of artificial feed using starch offers the possibility of increasing the growth of carnivorous fish in aquaculture.

TI  - Distributed Energy Management Method With EEOI Limitation for the Ship-Integrated Energy System
AB  - The ship-integrated energy system (S-IES), containing power and heating networks, plays a vital role in combining renewable technologies and conventional generators to advocate the protection of environmental awareness in the marine industry. To this end, the energy management problem (EMP) of the S-IES is investigated in this article. In this way, a load demand forecasting strategy with the ensemble learning system model is proposed to predict the energy consumption in a sailing voyage. Moreover, a multiobjective energy management model is constructed to depict the tradeoff between consumption costs and the energy efficiency operation index. Then, a distributed energy management method with the event-triggered mechanism is designed to solve the EMP of S-IES. With this method, each energy participant only needs to receive/send local information from/to its neighbors and achieves discrete-time information communication, eliminating the limitation of communication resources for ships. Rigorous theoretical analysis and simulation results prove that the distinct objectives are coordinated and that the effectiveness of the proposed method is guaranteed.

TI  - Digital Transformation in Maritime Ports: Defining Smart Gates through Process Improvement in a Portuguese Container Terminal
AB  - As the digital paradigm stimulates changes in various areas, seaports, which are fundamental to logistics and the global supply chain, are also undergoing a digital revolution, evolving into smart ports. Smart gates are essential components in this transformation, playing a vital role in increasing port efficiency. In the context of smart gates, the aim of this study is to understand how process management can serve as a catalyst for digital transformation, promoting efficiency in traffic flow and logistics. To achieve this objective, the design science research (DSR) methodology was followed, which allowed for the integration of information from several sources of requirement, encompassing both theoretical and practical aspects. The practical component took place at one of Portugal's largest container terminals, which allowed for the integration of information from various sources. As a result, this study presents the conceptual definition of a smart gate in terms of processes, main technologies, and key performance indicators that will support the monitoring and improvement of future operations. The results provide theoretical and practical contributions: on a practical level, they present a real application of the transformation towards a smart gate, serving as a model for other ports in their digitalization; on a theoretical level, they enrich the literature with a methodology for digitalizing maritime road gates, showing how the use of process management approaches, such as the BPMN, can increase operational efficiency in container terminals.

TI  - A new track for high-efficiency marine diesel engines: Initiative air jet and post-split injection combined
AB  - In pursuit of adequate mixing with a high volume of fuel injection, a re-intake scheme is proposed to promote the diffusion of combustibles and flames by using the disturbance of high-pressure air jets after the pressure peak. The results indicate that during the power stroke, an additional air jet enhances combustion by penetrating the spray and disturbing the flame front. The high-pressure air jet's obstruction of the atomization of local sprays achieves a longer combustion duration, while intensifying the vortex and temperature at the cylinder center, which enhances the evaporation of fuel near the nozzle. However, excessively high fuel injection pressure brings in more cold air, causing a temperature drop. It is necessary to have sufficient flame expansion before re-intake to eliminate the impact on pressure. By adjusting the re-intake pressure and timing, the air jet, when it reaches half the cylinder diameter, can exert its maximum advantage. By introducing post-injection and increasing the pressure of the first fuel injection, the air-spray impingement duration is extended, thereby improving thermal efficiency. This work, at 190 MPa injection pressure without changing the duration, and combined with a 5 degrees CA re-intake, achieved a 1.82 \% increase in thermal efficiency.

TI  - Enhancing Resiliency of Integrated Space- Air-Ground-Sea Networks with Renewable Energies: A Use Case After the 2023 TUrkiye Earthquake
AB  - Natural disasters can have catastrophic consequences; a poignant example is the series of 7.7- and 7.6-magnitude earthquakes that devastated T \& uuml;rkiye on February 6, 2023. To limit damage, it is essential to maintain the communications infrastructure to ensure individuals impacted by the disaster can receive critical information. The disastrous earthquakes in T \& uuml;rkiye have revealed the importance of considering communications and energy solutions together to build resilient and sustainable infrastructure. Thus, this article proposes an integrated space-air-ground-sea network architecture that utilizes various communications and energy-enabling technologies. This study aims to contribute to the development of robust and sustainable disaster-response frameworks. In light of the T \& uuml;rkiye earthquakes, two methods for network management are proposed. The first aims to ensure sustainability in the pre-disaster phase, and the second aims to maintain communications during the in-disaster phase. In these frameworks, communications technologies such as high altitude platform station(s) (HAPS), which are among the key enablers to unlock the potential of 6G networks and energy technologies, such as Renewable Energy Sources (RES), Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs), and Electric Vehicles (EVs), have been used as the prominent technologies. By simulating a case study, we demonstrate the performance of a proposed framework for providing network resiliency. The article concludes with potential challenges and future directions to achieve a disaster-resilient network architecture solution.

TI  - Development of spermatogonial cell transplantation in barramundi (Asian seabass: Lates calcarifer)
AB  - The selective breeding of farmed species is an essential task for sustainable aquaculture. Barramundi (Asian seabass: Lates calcarifer) is no exception in this respect, and artificial breeding is underway to establish strains with valuable genetic traits. For the long-term preservation of the many strains carrying diverse genetic characteristics, producing offspring derived from cryopreserved germ cells by transplantation into recipients is a powerful tool. Therefore, we aimed to develop a germ cell transplantation method, an essential step in obtaining the next generation derived from frozen germ cells in this study. First, testicular sections of various-sized fish (75 g-8 kg) were observed to identify the suitable maturation stages of donors. Immunocytochemistry with the antibody specifically recognizing the cell surface antigen of type A spermatogonia (ASGs) was performed. As a result, fish with <500 g of body weight possessed a higher number of ASGs, and their frequency of occurrence was also higher in their gonads. Although it was difficult to obtain sufficient amounts of testicular cell sus-pensions used for transplantation with conventional enzyme digestion, pretreatment using proteinase K was quite effective in dissociating the testicular tissues of this species. Next, 4-20 days post hatching (dph) larvae were sampled in a time-course manner. The development of their genital ridges was observed to identify the suitable developmental stages of larvae as recipients. By 16 dph, endogenous primordial germ cells were incorporated into the genital ridges and covered by somatic cell layers. This suggests that 16-dph or younger larvae are optimal for use as recipients. Lastly, we transplanted testicular cells, prepared using the above-mentioned optimal conditions, into the peritoneal cavity of 10-14 dph larvae. The transplantation success rate was compared for each total length of the recipient larvae. As a result, the transplantation success rates of 3.21 +/- 0.093 mm, 4.00 +/- 0.045 mm, and 5.01 +/- 0.13 mm total length recipients were 77.2\% +/- 12.3\%, 57.5\% +/- 4.7\%, and 45.3\% +/- 4.9\%, respectively. It was indicated by these results that donors weighing <500 g and larvae with a total length of about 3.2 mm are suitable for germ cell transplantation in barramundi.

TI  - Climate and salinity together control above ground carbon accumulation in the Sundarbans mangrove ecosystem
AB  - Mangroves play a crucial role in mitigating climate change through carbon (C) accumulation. Developing robust methods for the estimation of long-term C accumulation is essential for monitoring and reporting carbon financing projects under different global mechanisms. Moreover, understanding the effects of climate and habitat on C accumulation is important for developing mangrove management plans and conservation options. In this study, long-term above ground C accumulation in the three most dominated mangrove tree species, Heritiera fomes, , Excoecaria agallocha and Sonneratia apetala, was estimated using a dendrochronological approach in two contrasting (low vs high) salinity zones in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. In addition, how climate and habitat (e.g., regulators and soil resources) influence C accumulation was analyzed. For the first time, we estimated C accumulation in mangrove species over their entire lifetime using stem disc-derived tree-ring data. The C accumulation patterns exhibited similar patterns of variation, increasing from pith to bark in each case. C accumulation was significantly higher in the low salinity zone (LSZ) than in the high salinity zone (HSZ) (p p < 0.05). The cumulative C accumulation increased with tree age in each case, and C accumulation was influenced mainly by seasonal precipitation, especially during monsoon. General additive modeling (GAM) revealed that soil salinity had a stronger effect on C accumulation variability in the studied tree species. Other regulatory variables (i.e., siltation and elevation) and soil resources (i.e., P and K) had species-specific influences on C accumulation. Tree- ring data show the potential to yield better biomass and C estimations, which could aid frequent and rapid reporting of C accumulation in mangroves. Moreover, the results also suggest that climate and regulatory variables, especially soil salinity, together impact the C cycles in the Sundarbans.

TI  - Life Cycle Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Hydrogen Production via Water Electrolysis in South Korea
AB  - This study evaluated the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with hydrogen production in South Korea (hereafter referred to as Korea) using water electrolysis. Korea aims to advance hydrogen as a clean fuel for transportation and power generation. To support this goal, we employed a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to evaluate the emissions across the hydrogen supply chain in a well-to-pump framework, using the Korean clean hydrogen certification tiers. Our assessment covered seven stages, from raw material extraction for power plant construction to hydrogen production, liquefaction, storage, and distribution to refueling stations. Our findings revealed that, among the sixteen power sources evaluated, hydroelectric and onshore wind power exhibited the lowest emissions, qualifying as the Tier 2 category of emissions between 0.11 and 1.00 kgCO2e/kg H2 under a well-to-pump framework and Tier 1 category of emissions below 0.10 kgCO2e/kg H2 under a well-to-gate framework. They were followed by photovoltaics, nuclear energy, and offshore wind, all of which are highly dependent on electrolysis efficiency and construction inputs. Additionally, the study uncovered a significant impact of electrolyzer type on GHG emissions, demonstrating that improvements in electrolyzer efficiency could substantially lower GHG outputs. We further explored the potential of future energy mixes for 2036, 2040, and 2050, as projected by Korea's energy and environmental authorities, in supporting clean hydrogen production. The results suggested that with progressive decarbonization of the power sector, grid electricity could meet Tier 2 certification for hydrogen production through electrolysis, and potentially reach Tier 1 when considering well-to-gate GHG emissions.

TI  - A decision framework of offshore photovoltaic power station site selection based on Pythagorean fuzzy ELECTRE-III method
AB  - Offshore photovoltaic power stations (OPVPS) greatly help solve energy problems and land resource scarcity. A crucial phase of the OPVPS project lifecycle is site selection. To select the optimal location of OPVPS with many difficulties such as the uncertainty of the environment, the compensating relationships among criteria, and the different attributes of the alternatives, this paper proposed a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making framework based on Pythagorean fuzzy Elimination et Choix Traduisant la Realite-III (ELECTRE-III) method. First, the comprehensive criteria system for siting OPVPS was constructed, which included veto and evaluation criteria. Second, the Pythagorean fuzzy set was used to express the uncertain evaluation of experts. Third, considering the actual situation that experts had different experiences and abilities, this paper proposed a novel expert weighting method. Fourth, entropy weighting method, best-worst method, and combination weighting of game theory were introduced to calculate the criteria weights. Fifth, considering the compensation between criteria, ELECTRE-III was used for ranking. Finally, to verify the applicability and robustness of the proposed framework, a China case study was conducted; the results showed that Haizhou Bay is the best alternative.

TI  - Sandy sediment-based solar evaporator for large-scale and scalable freshwater production under various water environments
AB  - Interface solar steam generation (ISSG) technology has immense potential for addressing the global freshwater crisis. However, its large-scale application faces challenges such as limited sources and high costs of photothermal materials, complex fabrication processes, and poor stability and controllability. In this study, natural Yellow River sandy sediments (SS), which are abundant, easily accessible, and representative of natural sands, were used to synthesize tannic acid (TA) -Fe (III)-coated SS (TA-Fe@SS) as a photothermal material using a facile surface modification strategy. An efficient TA-Fe@SS-based ISSG system was developed by manipulating the microstructure of the SS, including particle size, TA -Fe modification density, and stacking form, and the impact of microstructural changes on the water transport rate, light absorption, and photothermal conversion efficiency was systematically investigated. The enhancement mechanism of water evaporation at the TA-Fe@SS aggregate interface was also elucidated. Under optimal conditions, the TA-Fe@SS-based water evaporator achieved a remarkable water evaporation rate of up to 2.84 kg \& sdot;m ï¿½ 2 \& sdot;h- 1 and a solar evaporation efficiency of 172 \%. Furthermore, the TA-Fe@SS exhibited durability in various water environments, including acidic/alkaline water, dye-contaminated water, and real seawater. Potential large-scale outdoor application models were provided, confirming the applicability of TA-Fe@SS under various conditions.

TI  - Postwar development of offshore energy resources: Legal and political models for developing the Gaza Marine gas field
AB  - This article examines the case of Gaza Marine, a small offshore natural gas reservoir in Gaza that has remained undeveloped since its discovery in 2000. Due to the complicated political status of the Gaza Strip over the past two decades, neither the Palestinian Authority, Hamas, nor Israel could claim full rights to Gaza's maritime zones or develop the Gaza Marine field. However, the devastating 2023 Israel-Hamas war created four possible scenarios of administration over Gaza, each with its own legal implications for the development rights of the field. These scenarios include Palestinian independence, continued Israeli occupation, international transitional administration (ITA) over Gaza, or partial Israeli annexation of Gaza. This article argues that the development of Gaza Marine is a vital part of Gaza's postwar reconstruction and is possible under these scenarios, the most understudied of which is the ITA model. This article can thus serve as a roadmap for other postwar coastal territories with contested rights over offshore energy deposits.  Â© The Author(s), 2024.

TI  - Mapping of the levelised cost of energy from floating solar PV in coastal waters of the European Atlantic, North Sea and Baltic Sea
AB  - Floating photovoltaic (PV) energy has been widely deployed in reservoirs, but its coastal and offshore potential remains largely untapped. This work presents the first large-scale mapping of the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) from floating PV. The main objective is to ascertain its spatial variability and facilitate the comparison between potential areas for deployment, in the understanding that current LCOEs may evolve in future. The study region encompasses the coastal waters of the European Atlantic, the North and Baltic Seas. A comprehensive breakdown of the costs incurred throughout the lifetime of an exemplar floating PV farm is presented based on site-specific factors, such as water depth and distance to shore. The energy production is estimated using site-specific reanalysis data. Results reveal the principal roles of solar resources and the distance to shore, the latter due to its effect on installation costs. The role of water depth is secondary. Southern nearshore areas present low LCOEs, with the lowest ( 250 EUR/MWh) in Spain and Portugal. LCOEs increase with latitude, reaching 650 EUR/MWh in northern Norway. In the North and Baltic Seas, LCOEs are 400 EUR/MWh and 440 EUR/MWh, respectively. Additionally, LCOEs are estimated for different floating platforms and PV technologies to identify potential cost reductions. Uncompetitive though they may be now without subsidies or feed-in tariffs, current values will probably decrease as the technology develops, the supply chain matures and economies of scale kick in. This analysis helps to identify the areas with the greatest potential for floating PV in the region.

TI  - Development of compliant modular floating photovoltaic farm for coastal conditions
AB  - Floating photovoltaic (PV) farms can be constructed in coastal marine conditions for the abundant ocean space compared to reservoirs. New challenges may arise when extending existing designs of reservoir floating PV farms to coastal regions because of the complex environmental conditions, especially for the pontoon type floating PV systems. This study presents the methodologies for the design and verification of such floating PV farms based on the practical example of one of the world's largest nearshore floating photovoltaic farms off Woodlands in Singapore. This 5 MW pilot project aims to move floating PV farms from inland water to nearshore regions for future larger-scale deployments. The innovative floating system is adapted from the successful modular floating PV development at Tengeh Reservoir and improved to withstand harsher marine environmental conditions. This study comprehensively introduces various aspects of the development of the nearshore floating modular PV farm, including its design, verification via full-scale experimental testing and numerical studies, construction, and power generation performances. The floating PV system comprises standardized floating modules made of high -density polyethylene (HDPE) that support PV panels or operational and maintenance work. A compliant design allows the floating system to follow wave motion. A verification study was conducted through full-scale experimental tests and numerical simulations based on a representative subsystem of the floating PV farm, focusing on its hydrodynamic performance. Finally, this study presents and discuss the on-site operational energy production performance. This study may serve as a reference for developing large-scale floating PV farms in coastal marine conditions.

TI  - Negative net global warming potential hydrogen production through biomass gasification combined with chemical looping: Environmental and economic assessments
AB  - The integration of biomass gasification (BG) with chemical looping hydrogen production (CLHP) offers one prospective approach for green hydrogen production. The environmental and economic assessments are conducted to evaluated the sustainable performance of the BG-CLHP system during the hydrogen production cycle (HPC). The results showed that the environmental impacts of BG-CLHP are concentrated in freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity (FAETP), human toxicity (HTP), and acidification (AP). The BG-CLHP system can provide a more cost-competitive hydrogen supply solution for hydrogen refueling stations compared the offshore wind or photovoltaic (PV) powered electrolysis, given the same hydrogen production target. For global warming potential (GWP) and cost, the BG-CLHP demonstrates excellent integrated performance with GWP values of -15.13 and -17.00 kg CO 2, eq /kg H 2 , for the Air case and Oxygen case, and the costs of 3.05 and 2.82 \$/kg H 2 , respectively, and sensitivity analysis reveals that the CLHP stage is the primary contributor to GWP. Compared with existing hydrogen production routes, BG-CLHP can still be improved in terms of costs and the technical maturity, however, the excellent negative GWP properties of BG-CLHP make it will play a more important role in future large-scale hydrogen production.

TI  - The impact of pumped hydro energy storage configurations on investment planning of hybrid systems with renewables
AB  - The pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) systems can be installed in various configurations depending on the specific geographical and hydrological conditions. Closed-loop PHES systems are off-stream and have no natural inflow to the system. However, open-loop systems are on-stream and have natural inflows to the upper and/or lower reservoirs. In this study, we develop two-stage stochastic programming models for various PHES configurations to investigate how the choice of PHES configuration impacts the sizing decisions and costs of a hybrid system that includes a renewable power generator co-operated with PHES. Our numerical results show that using a PHES facility instead of a conventional hydropower system reduces the expected system cost and mismatched demand significantly. Open-loop PHES facilities perform better than closed-loop PHES and seawater-PHES facilities, dramatically lowering the need for fossil fuels in demand fulfillment. The most cost-efficient PHES configuration is when there is natural inflow to the upper reservoir. Using solar energy instead of wind as the renewable source significantly increases the requirement for larger upper reservoirs in on-stream open-loop PHES facilities, while reducing the expected system cost for all configurations.

TI  - Predicting corrosion for life estimation of ocean and coastal steel infrastructure
AB  - Physical infrastructure in coastal and offshore locations often is constructed from mild and low alloy steels. These are prone to marine corrosion even with the application of protective coatings and cathodic protection. Particularly for high-value assets such as energy facilities (wind farms, oil and gas production and subsea pipelines), the prediction of their safe and economic life is of much interest. Herein, a review is given of the modern development of models for the prediction of long-term marine corrosion of steel exposed to various marine environments. These include immersion, tidal, splash and atmospheric zones and contact with sands and soils. The effects of temperature and water pollution are especially important, as is the ability of the steels or irons to form protective corrosion products. Comments are made also about other alloys such as copper-nickels and aluminium. All show that corrosion, including pitting corrosion, develops with increased exposure time in a bimodal manner. The reasons for such behaviour are considered, together with the practical implications, important for containment structures such as pipelines, tanks and floating offshore energy platforms. A schematic bi-modal model for long-term marine corrosion of steel exposed to marine immersion, tidal, splash and atmospheric zones and other nonmarine zones such as in contact with sands and soils. Also applicable to alloys such as copper-nickels and aluminium. image

TI  - Economics, environmental foot print and sustainability of community scale solar desalination plant in water scarce Somalia coastal regions
AB  - Clean water supply in low-income countries can be improved by utilizing affordable renewable energy-powered desalination technologies. In this research work, viability of community scale solar desalination plant (at least 3.0 m3/d capacity) capable of addressing the daily fresh water demands of hundred families in twenty three coastal locations of Somalia has been investigated through year-round simulations. The required desalination plant size and investment is heavily dependent on solar radiation potential of the site. The potable water production cost ranges between 8.66 to 9.48 USD/m3, and is lower than the nonreliable conventional water supply cost in eighteen Somalia coastal locations. Moreover, the desalination plant can sooth at least 2.5 to 13.6-kilo tons of CO2 emission, 6.0 to 33.3-tons of SO2 emission and, 2.30 to 12.6-tons of NOX emission during its 5.0 to 25.0 years operation period. The sustainability index and finance payback time of community scale solar desalination plant is about 1.08, and 4.0 to 13.0 years, respectively. The economics and environmental foot print results indicate feasibility and potential application of community scale solar desalination plant in water starved Somalia coastal locations.

TI  - Association of reef fish with oil and gas platforms in the Northern Gulf of Mexico
AB  - Offshore oil and gas platforms support abundant reef fish and are popular fishing sites for recreational anglers. However, the rapid decommissioning and removal of active platforms have decreased such fishing opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico, raising concerns about fisheries impacts. Conversely, planned offshore energy structures like wind turbines may offer similar habitats and fishing sites. To inform spatial planning for marine energy infrastructure in the context of recreational fisheries, we created models of fish communities associated with oil and gas platforms using existing abundance data. We employed Random Forest analysis to predict the presence-absence and abundance of Red Snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) and Greater Amberjack (Seriola dumerili) at platforms using 47 environmental and platform variables. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities explored fish species composition among 37 species. Results showed variability in Red Snapper and Greater Amberjack incidence/abundance from shore to shelf-edge, not attributed to surrounding habitat or climatological oceanographic variables. Incidence models were more robust than abundance models. Fish species composition was significantly influenced by location gradient, with less impact from other habitat features. Our findings guide selecting areas for artificial structures to enhance angler opportunities and maintain fish diversity, but identifying the drivers of finer scale abundance variation will require further sampling. Maps showing fish incidence and abundance at sampling locations.

TI  - Development and Succession of Non-Indigenous and Cryptogenic Species over Two Different Substrates in the Port of Alicante (Western Mediterranean)
AB  - Artificial structures act as points of entry for non-indigenous species (NIS) in port areas and may support higher abundance and richness of them. The studies about NIS are increasing, but studies focusing on the variations in temporal recruitment and ecological mechanisms are still scarce. Thus, the aim of this work was to determine the colonization and development of non-indigenous sessile fouling species over two types of substrates (electrolytic carbonated and steel) during 12 months of immersion in the Alicante harbor. The biofouling communities of both substrates were analyzed in terms of abundance and species richness by status (native, cryptogenic, and NIS), and NIS assemblages of both substrates were studied by means of multivariate analyses. In total, 53 different species were identified, 38 in steel (six NIS and six cryptogenic) and 50 in the carbonated substrate (six NIS and 10 cryptogenic). Most NIS were more abundant and diverse after 9 months of immersion and had a preference for carbonated substrates. Furthermore, most of them were positively correlated in both substrates (mainly in steel) and it is noted that the number of NIS in the port of Alicante is increasing as new records have been detected.

TI  - Clean Marine Fuel: Integration of Co-pyrolysis Oil with High-Sulfur Fuel Oil
AB  - The study investigated the production of pyrolysis oil by co-pyrolyzing palm fronds and waste-expanded polystyrene and then blending it with high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO). This was considered one of the strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG-7) target of reducing emissions and HSFO consumption. The pyrolysis oil produced at 400 Â°C did not contain benzene, which is already restricted in fuel. The primary chemical compound in the pyrolysis oil was styrene, along with several other aromatic compounds, including ethylbenzene, toluene, Î±-methylstyrene, and various other aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenates. The high hydrocarbon content in pyrolysis oil resulted in a high calorific value of 41.99 MJ/kg, low water content, and promoted the mixing of pyrolysis oil with HSFO. Additionally, pyrolysis oil had a very low sulfur content. The properties of the blended fuels showed that blending 5-10% of pyrolysis oil with HSFO resulted in a fuel that met marine fuel standards and provided several benefits, including reduced viscosity and lower sulfur content. Moreover, due to its lower viscosity, the blended fuel may require less energy to preheat before entering the engine, thus effectively improving fuel efficiency.

TI  - The inclusion of Amazon mangroves in Brazilâ€™s REDD+ program
AB  - The Legal Amazon of Brazil holds vast mangrove forests, but a lack of awareness of their value has prevented their inclusion into results-based payments established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Based on an inventory from over 190 forest plots in Amazon mangroves, we estimate total ecosystem carbon stocks of 468 Â± 67 Megagrams (Mg) haâˆ’1; which are significantly higher than Brazilian upland biomes currently included into national carbon offset financing. Conversion of mangroves results in potential emissions of 1228 Mg CO2e haâˆ’1, which are 3-fold higher than land use emissions from conversion of the Amazon rainforest. Our work provides the foundation for the inclusion of mangroves in Brazilâ€™s intended Nationally Determined Contribution, and here we show that halting mangrove deforestation in the Legal Amazon would generate avoided emissions of 0.9 Â± 0.3 Teragrams (Tg) CO2e yrâˆ’1; which is equivalent to the annual carbon accumulation in 82,400 ha of secondary forests.

TI  - Feasibility Assessment for the Application of Carbon Capture Systems Onboard Cargo Ships in Response to the EU ETS Regulation
AB  - The role of the maritime industry in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to mitigate the effects of global warming is significant. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a specific target for the industry, but the challenge is to implement emission-reducing technologies at scale. The use of fossil fuels is still dominant in the shipping sector, also due to the significant barriers that hinder the full adoption of carbon-neutral alternative fuels. The transition to a low-carbon economy presents an opportunity for the industry to lead the way towards a sustainable innovation and demonstrate a commitment to reducing its environmental impact. In this context, Carbon Capture System (CCS) technologies have been identified as a promising solution, but their implementation on ships comes with its own set of challenges. In this paper, the authors aims at exploring the technical requirements and consequences of the installation of a CCS based on the use of Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) onboard a container ship. To validate their assumptions, the authors set up a simulation tool able to evaluate the potential reduction in Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions from the ship along a selected route. On the basis of the tool outcomes, the authors were able to provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed system's costs and benefits, emphasizing the considerable savings that could be attained through the implementation of this technology on board cargo ships with a specific consideration to the future implementation of carbon emission taxes and a focus on the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS) regulation. The findings of this research offer valuable perspectives on creating more effective and environmentally friendly approaches to mitigate GHG in the maritime sector. Â© 2024 IOS Press.

TI  - Advancing Blue Carbon Knowledge: Leveraging Geomatics for Capacity Building through the BlueCARES Project
AB  - Mangrove forests and seagrass meadows, collectively termed as blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), play a pivotal role in carbon sequestration and climate mitigation. Blue carbon research enables advancing scientific knowledge and gaining insights into their current state, which is crucial for making informed decisions on its conservation and management practices. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) launched the â€œComprehensive Assessment and Conservation of Blue Carbon (BC) Ecosystems and their Services in the Coral Triangleâ€ or BlueCARES to pioneer joint research on blue carbon ecosystems and formulate conservation strategies at local and national levels. BlueCARES aims to establish a robust Blue Carbon Strategy and initiate the establishment of the Blue Carbon Network (BCnet), convening various stakeholders, including government agencies, local government units, academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations. BCnet organizes summits, workshops, and conferences to facilitate collaboration. Through capacity development initiatives, the project empowers stakeholders to actively engage in field surveys, conservation efforts, and the implementation of the Blue Carbon Strategy, even after the project concludes. This paper narrates the capacity-building engagements made by the Geomatics team, leveraging remote sensing and geospatial technologies to foster sustainable blue carbon management practices and ensure the long-term resilience of BCEs in the country.

TI  - Diverse inorganic carbon uptake strategies in Antarctic seaweeds: Revealing species-specific responses and implications for Ocean Acidification
AB  - Seaweeds are important components of coastal benthic ecosystems along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), providing refuge, food, and habitat for numerous associated species. Despite their crucial role, the WAP is among the regions most affected by global climate change, potentially impacting the ecology and physiology of seaweeds. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations have led to increased dissolved inorganic carbon (Ci) with consequent declines in oceanic pH and alterations in seawater carbonate chemistry, known as Ocean Acidification (OA). Seaweeds possess diverse strategies for Ci uptake, including CO2 concentrating mechanisms (CCMs), which may distinctly respond to changes in Ci concentrations. Conversely, some seaweeds do not operate CCMs (non-CCM species) and rely solely on CO2. Nevertheless, our understanding of the status and functionality of Ci uptake strategies in Antarctic seaweeds remains limited. Here, we investigated the Ci uptake strategies of seaweeds along a depth gradient in the WAP. Carbon isotope signatures (Î´13C) and pH drift assays were used as indicators of the presence or absence of CCMs. Our results reveal variability in CCM occurrence among algal phyla and depths ranging from 0 to 20 m. However, this response was species specific. Among red seaweeds, the majority relied solely on CO2 as an exogenous Ci source, with a high percentage of non-CCM species. Green seaweeds exhibited depth-dependent variations in CCM status, with the proportion of non-CCM species increasing at greater depths. Conversely, brown seaweeds exhibited a higher prevalence of CCM species, even in deep waters, indicating the use of CO2 and HCO3âˆ’. Our results are similar to those observed in temperate and tropical regions, indicating that the potential impacts of OA on Antarctic seaweeds will be species specific. Additionally, OA may potentially increase the abundance of non-CCM species relative to those with CCMs. Â© 2024 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Role of tidal meander migration on carbon release of tidal flat sediments: a case study of the central Jiangsu tidal flats; [æ½®æ²Ÿæ›²æµæ‘†åŠ¨å¯¹æ½®æ»©æ²‰ç§¯ç‰©ç¢³è¾“å‡ºçš„å½±å“â€”â€”â€”ä»¥æ±Ÿè‹ä¸­éƒ¨æ½®æ»©ä¸ºä¾‹]
AB  - Tidal flats are among the ecosystems with the highest carbon sequestration capacity globally, serving as effective blue carbon sinks to mitigate global warming. Current research on this issue primarily focuses on carbon input processes driven by biological activities, while carbon output processes under geomorphic evolution, especially tidal meander migration, are limited. This knowledge gap makes it challenging to accurately predict and assess the carbon sequestration capability of tidal flats. Here we integrate field observations, remote sensing with laboratory experiments to investigate the impact of tidal meander migration on carbon release of tidal flat sediment. Results show that the range of variation characterizing the migration rates of tidal meanders can actually span many orders of magnitude, which sharply decreases from 10-3 m/ s on silty flats to 10-6 m/ s in salt marshes. The migration rates of tidal meanders in the muddy silt flats exhibit significantly seasonal variability, with the rates in winter being approximately twice of those observed in summer. The content of organic carbon in tidal flat soil demonstrates a seaward declining trend: salt marshes (4.62 g/ kg)>muddy flats (2.61 g/ kg)>silty flats (1.51 g/ kg). By integrating the migration rate of tidal meanders and soil organic carbon content, we found that carbon release rate of sediment measured on silt flats (49.4 g C m-2 a-1) was much higher than in salt marshes and muddy flats, which is comparable to the carbon buried rate on unvegetated flats. Overall, our study confirms the importance of tidal meander migration on sediment carbon release, providing crucial theoretical foundations and data support for enhancing the prediction of carbon sink function of tidal flats.

TI  - Carbon reduction paths for Chinese oil companies under the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals; [â€œåŒç¢³â€ç›®æ ‡ä¸‹ä¸­å›½çŸ³æ²¹ä¼ä¸šç»¿è‰²å‡ç¢³è·¯å¾„]
AB  - To cope with the global warming and achieve the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, Chinese oil companies have taken a series of carbon reduction measures. This paper analyzes the current carbon emissions in China and the carbon reduction measures taken by oil companies, and clarifies the challenges in carbon reduction. Finally, some carbon reduction paths are proposed for the Chinese oil companies. The results indicate that in the process of oil and gas production and utilization, greenhouse gas is mainly emitted in the upstreams. The Chinese oil companies adopt carbon capture, carbon reduction, carbon substitution, and carbon emission trading methods to reduce the carbon emissions, while maintaining energy supply and improving quality and efficiency. Moreover, some companies have been developing wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, hydrogen energy and marine new energy according to local conditions, gradually promoting the green transformation of energy. According to the research results and the current situation of Chinese oil enterprises, some carbon reduction paths are proposed. First, a scientific and reasonable multi-energy complementation system should be built to realize the collaborative development of conventional energy and new energy. Second, low-cost and efficient technologies should be developed in fossil energy mining, clean energy development, and digital carbon neutrality, etc., and the initial innovation capability should be enhanced to address. Moreover, initiative actions should be taken in the new round of industrial revolution and technological transformation. Third, the exchange and cooperation with national/international enterprises, local governments, universities/colleges, and research institutes should be strengthened to ensure the advancement of associated technologies and to cultivate professional and technical talents.

TI  - Carbon stock of mangrove ecosystem and role blue economy in Pangandaran West Java
AB  - The mangrove ecosystem is a forest area that grows in coastal areas and is located at a distance of 200 meters from the shoreline. Mangroves are one of the blue-carbon ecosystems that can absorb CO2 through the process of photosynthesis and store carbon in the form of biomass in the soil. Mangroves are the second largest store of carbon stocks in waters after coral reefs. The availability of mangrove ecosystem carbon stock data is very important as a baseline in the greenhouse data inventory from blue carbon ecosystems. Blue carbon can be used as a reference for the welfare of coastal communities commonly called the blue economy, the blue economy focuses on generating economic growth from the fisheries and marine sector in Indonesia. Marine ecosystems are also impacted by climate change. Based on data from WWF's Living Blue Planet Report 2015, the number of marine populations decreased by 49% in the period 1970-2012. The data is closely related to the sustainable economic growth of the marine fisheries sector, in this case, the mangrove ecosystem. Analysis of mangrove ecosystems using circle plots carried out measurements of tree diameter and length and identification of tree species according to predetermined subplots then analyzed the amount of carbon stock using the Allometric Equation Model. The result obtained is that 80% of mangrove habitat conditions are still very good so they can contribute to producing a total stored carbon stock (blue carbon) of 55.98 tons/ha this can be an ecosystem service for the surrounding community that can increase the blue economy in the Pangandaran area of West Java.

TI  - A critical review of current conversion facilities and research output on carbon dioxide utilization
AB  - Abstract: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has struggled over the past few decades to demonstrate the economic viability of CO2 sequestration. Consequently, this study reviewed the existing integrated carbon capture utilization facilities and the published articles on CO2 conversion to building materials, chemical intermediates, fuels, urea, and polymers. Representative sample sizes were determined, and the analysis of the current CO2 conversion facilities and volume of published articles between 2016 and 2022 were done based on a 90% confidence limit within a 9.93% margin of error and a 95% confidence limit within a 5% margin of error, respectively. The results showed that over 90% of global CO2 conversion facilities produce chemical intermediates, urea, polymers, and building materials, and less than 10% produce fuels. More than half of the global CO2 conversion facilities are in South-East Asia (mainly China), with the remaining in Western Europe (23%), North America (20%), and Oceania (3%). The analysis of the research publications within the time under investigation showed that the research focus is currently on CO2 conversion to chemical intermediates, polymers, building materials, and fuels (over 95%) and less on urea. Graphical abstract: (Figure presented.) Highlights: A literature survey using Cochranâ€™s model on the global CO2 utilization facilities based on location and product type and the recent publications on CO2 conversion to value-added products is presented. Most existing CO2 conversion facilities produce chemical intermediates, polymers, urea, and building materials, while most of the research output focused on CO2 conversion to chemical intermediates, polymers, building materials, and fuels. A future perspective on the need to increase CO2 conversion facilities and research output on fuel synthesis to aid the aviation and maritime sectors' decarbonization was also highlighted. Discussion: The economic viability of the CCS technology has been on the front burner of every aspect of energy (primarily from fossils) sustainability in recent times. Some experts have stated that more focus should be placed on achieving net-zero emissions than the energy transition. They argue that even the mining and processing of the â€œfiniteâ€ metals used for manufacturing the so-called â€œcleanâ€ tech equipment, just like their fossil counterparts, also result in the emission of greenhouse gases. Consequently, producing carbonâ€“neutral fuels is a more realistic pathway for tackling climate change and attaining environmental sustainability. The conversion of CO2 to chemical intermediates, polymers, building materials, and fuels has been identified as a viable way of creating a business case for the CCUS process. However, there is currently no consensus on which products will most likely provide a positive balance sheet for the CCUS process.

TI  - Estimation of Carbon Stock in The Seagrass Meadows of Jelenga Bay, West Sumbawa, Indonesia
AB  - Blue carbon is a term used to describe the carbon stored in coastal and marine ecosystems. Research and conservation of blue carbon sinks like seagrass meadows are important in mitigating global climate change. This research aimed to estimate blue carbon stored in the seagrass meadows ecosystem of Jelenga Bay, West Sumbawa, Indonesia. Carbon stock in the seagrass community was estimated based on correlation analysis of density, biomass, and organic carbon content. Meanwhile, the correlation analysis of dry bulk density and organic carbon content was used to estimate the susbtrate carbon stock. Four seagrass species were found in Jelenga Bay, i.e., Enhalus acoroides, Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea rotundata, and Halodule pinifolia. Carbon stock estimation of the seagrass community within 107.1 hectares area showed that aboveground biomass stored 19.1 Mg of carbon (0.18 Mg C/ha), whereas belowground biomass stored 28.4 Mg of carbon (0.26 Mg C/ha). Carbon stock estimation in seagrass meadows substrate (in 1 meter depth) stored 4,590.0 Mg C (42.86 Mg C/ha). The substrate at 70-100 cm depth contributed the highest amount of carbon stock, i.e., 14.9 Mg. However, for the organic carbon content, depth of 15-30 cm showed the highest result (0.341 % of Dry Bulk Density). Â© The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

TI  - Quantifying and Mapping the Ecosystem Carbon Stock of Mangrove Forests in the Philippines using machine learning and new-generation remote sensing data
AB  - Mangrove forests are an important carbon (C) sink in the tropics. Ecosystem Carbon stocks from biomass and soil are important parameters to quantify and map in the mangrove area. However, very few reports are available at the country level, including the Philippines. This study was conducted in selected coastal areas of the Philippines to: 1) quantify and evaluate the Ecosystem Carbon Stocks of mangrove forest; and 2) map and determine the spatial distribution of the Ecosystem Carbon Stocks of mangrove forest. Intensive field assessments, combined with laboratory analysis, remote sensing and geospatial techniques were implemented to achieve the above objectives. We used field data, global mangrove soil C map and data from Sentinel-2 imagery in Google Earth Engine cloud platform to estimate the Ecosystem C Stock using machine learning algorithm. Results of this study revealed that the mean Ecosystem C stocks of mangrove forests based on field plots was 494.12 MgC ha-1 while those predicted from remotely sensed data covering the whole country was 538.5 MgC/ha. The potential contribution of our Philippine mangroves to global Climate Change mitigation could translate to about 550 M tCO2 eq. The province of Palawan had the highest C stock. This study has shown the relatively enormous amount of Carbon stocked and stored in biomass and soil of mangroves in the country and suggests the need to protect them. Future studies should endeavor to explore the use of other datasets (e.g. GEDI-based Canopy Height Map) in predicting and mapping the spatial distribution of the Ecosystem C stock of mangroves in the country.

TI  - Evaluation and monitoring of offshore CO2 storage using marine electromagnetic sounding
AB  - The storage of offshore carbon dioxide (CO2) is seen as an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Submarine sediments offer a large volume and adequate permeability for the long-term injection of CO2at high pressure and low temperature. The selection and monitoring of offshore CO2storage sites have a significant impact on their stability and safety. Therefore, accurately identifying the distribution of offshore CO2storage is crucial for monitoring. This study utilizes marine controllable source electromagnetic sounding (CSEM) to investigate the sensitivity of identifying plume transport distributions in offshore CO2storage monitoring. The results show that CSEM is effective in monitoring the distribution of CO2plumes during offshore storage processes. The changes in electromagnetic field response can reflect the distribution of CO2plumes, providing important basis for the stability and safety of offshore CO2storage site selection and monitoring.

TI  - Flat-plate photobioreactors for renewable resources production
AB  - Large-scale (macro)algae cultivation has been practiced for centuries in many parts of the world, particularly in Asia, where seaweed has been a traditional food source. Microalgae cultivation at a large scale began in the mid-20th century with the development of the Chlorella (food supplement) industry in Japan. Chlorella could be grown in large quantities using artificial light and temperature-controlled tanks. Since then, many new designs for algal bioreactors (photobioreactors [PBRs]) have emerged to provide controlled environments for the production of goods such as renewable resources, food and feed, medicines, and other valuable chemicals. One of the most promising types of PBR which gained tremendous attention due to its immense potential for creating renewable bioactive resources from microalgae is the flat plate photobioreactor (FP-PBR). This chapter explores the advantages of FP-PBR over other closed PBRs, summarizes the potential renewable resources which have been potentially produced using FP-PBR, and includes the state-of-the-art of FP-PBR design. This ground-breaking tool offers a controlled environment that makes it possible to cultivate and harvest these priceless creatures quickly as well as separate target bioactive and renewable resources. The flat-plate PBR's design and controlled environment makes it possible to precisely manage important variables including temperature, light intensity, and nutrition supply. This makes it possible to perfect the growth conditions for optimal output and the synthesis of bioactive compounds. Additionally, the FP-PBR shields the microbes from impurities and changes in the environment, assuring high-quality production, and scalability. It is excellent for both research and commercial purposes since it can be simply extended or copied to enhance production capacity. The whole manufacturing process can be streamlined by the modular design's simple interaction with other process steps including downstream separation and extraction units. The use of microalgae in the FP-PBR provides a variety of potential for the generation of renewable bioactive resources including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and pigments, which have uses in food and feed, cosmetics, drugs, and biofuels. Additionally, through photosynthesis, microalgae are able to absorb and use carbon dioxide (CO2), offering an eco-friendly method of reducing and using CO2. Looking toward the future, new trends and promising technologies including immobilized microalgal beads, in-situ product recovery (ISPR), and integrated novel design approaches in FP-PBR technology are analyzed and appraised. The chapter concludes with a continuous production process outlook in FP-PBR considering also the need for pre- and postprocessing steps and how these may best be integrated with FP-PBRs.

TI  - Lab-on-Chip Total Alkalinity Sensor for Highly Resolved, Efficient, and Long-Term Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification of Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement
AB  - Increasing atmospheric CO2 from human activities is causing shifts in marine chemical and biological cycles. Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) shows promise as a potential carbon dioxide removal (CDR) solution. However, comprehensive measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) of OAE is required for the development and deployment of OAE as a CDR technology. The current observational approaches are not yet standardized or readily available to assess early-stage field trials. In this study, we report using a microfluidic lab-on-a-chip total alkalinity sensor in an OAE field experiment conducted in Tuft's Cove, Halifax, Canada to monitor seawater alkalinity during and after the addition of an alkaline mineral. To the authors knowledge, this is the first reported lab-on-chip sensor used in support of OAE mCDR. Over a 40-day period, our sensor collected 374 measurements along with 60 on-board standard measurements with the measurement frequency of one measurement per three hours. We report a precision of 9.2 Âµmol/kg which is the standard deviation of the CRM measurements. The data obtained during this trial demonstrates the capability of our technology for total alkalinity monitoring at OAE sites for long periods.  Â© 2024 IEEE.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of Seawater Battery Power Generation in a Monitored Environment
AB  - Continuous or long-term monitoring of the deep-sea is essential for evaluating its natural resource potential, economic value (such as oil and mineral resources), and biodiversity. However, it encounters significant energy challenges because traditional energy sources-such as waves, tides, sunlight, and wind-are not feasible at the ocean bottom. Seawater batteries (SWB) have emerged as a promising alternative, offering high theoretical energy density, safety, economy, and environmental benefits. SWBs generate energy through the oxidation of a reactive metal anode, like a magnesium alloy, and reduction reactions at the cathode, using seawater as the electrolyte. Research highlights magnesium SWBs' potential, demonstrating their ability to provide stable power over long periods. This study investigates the efficiency of reduced-cost magnesium alloy batteries with carbon materials, assessing various configurations and their performance concerning water parameters. The experiments revealed that magnesium alloy paired with a graphite-nickel foam cathode performed better than the carbon fiber brush with titanium wire. Testing the Mg-Graphite-Nickel foam battery prototype in a controlled environment showed a specific energy output of 552.96 Wh/kg and a power output of 42 mW for a magnesium mass of 260 g. Analysis of water parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, redox potential, electrical conductivity, and salinity indicated their significant impact on battery performance. The findings suggest that SWBs can meet the energy needs of underwater sensors, providing a viable and eco-friendly solution. Further research and development could optimize these batteries, enhancing the longevity and efficiency of seafloor monitoring systems.  Â© 2024 IEEE.

TI  - Application of Renewable Energy for Water Treatment in Climate-Vulnerable Areas: Towards Co-Designing a Solar-Powered Pond Sand Filter in Coastal Areas of Bangladesh
AB  - Pond water, the commonly used sweet water source on the southwest coast of Bangladesh, has increasingly been considered a critical adaptation option to climate change impacts like salinity intrusion. As a feasible technology, Pond Sand Filter (PSF) has been widely promoted, upgraded, and modified by utilizing renewable energy, specifically solar power, contributing to climate change mitigation. Since socio-economic and socio-technical designs need to be integrated into promoting such technology, this chapter describes the process of using the â€˜double diamondâ€™ approach in co-designing and piloting a solar-powered PSF technology in Bangladesh and presents the insights of the action research.

TI  - COMPARISON OF A FULL-SCALE AND A 1:10 SCALE LOW-SPEED TWO-STROKE MARINE ENGINE USING COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS
AB  - International marine shipping is a growing component of international trade; a vast majority of all the worldâ€™s goods are being transported on large ocean-going vessels. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) in 2013, a regulatory framework of associated metrics for reducing emissions of CO2 per tonne-mile from shipping by approximately 10% each decade. Therefore, decarbonizing the maritime sector requires the development of new fuel sources. Because of the extremely large physical size of the internal combustion engines present in shipping vessels, experimental iterative development of the engine and fuel system is cost-prohibitive. Thus, the ability to perform combustion system development in a scaled platform that can be more easily operated and modeled computationally is of interest. To that end, scaling relationships are needed to translate the results from a smaller engine to a larger counterpart. Scaling studies to date have been restricted to low scaling ratios, four-stroke light-duty engines, and under-resolved computational fluid dynamic simulations that likely do not accurately capture the physics of scaling. In this work, computational models of a 1:10 scale and a full-scale two-stroke crosshead low-speed marine engine were created and validated against experiments obtained in a real 1:10 scale engine installed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Due to the large size of the full-scale engine, the model required large high-performance computing resources to be evaluated. The availability of high-performance computing resources at the Department of Energyâ€™s Leadership Computing Facilities is an enabler of the current work. The results of the small- and large-scale engine simulations were compared to analyze the effectiveness of the appropriate scaling laws under these extreme scaling ratio conditions.

TI  - Development of Renewable Energy-Certified Onshore Power Supply in Indonesian Ports to Reduce Carbon Emissions
AB  - The implementation of the Onshore Power Supply (OPS) business at ports is one of the efforts to accelerate the energy transition in the maritime transportation sector. In the case study of one port in Indonesia, the use of OPS facilities has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by 4.19% or 127 MTCO2. If the use of OPS facilities can be increased for all ports in Indonesia, it can help accelerate the achievement of the Net Zero Emission target. This OPS business model involves several business entities including PT PLN (Persero) as the provider of electricity and infrastructure from the network/grid, the owner of the port business area as the investor and implementer of the OPS business, and the owner or operator of the ship. In terms of operational aspects and financial analysis, the feasibility of implementing OPS greatly influences the percentage of the number of ships docked using OPS facilities as well as tariff adjustments with an adjustment period every 2 years with an indicative IRR of 11 - 13%, Net Present Value IDR 2 - 3M, Benefit Cost Ratio> 1, and Payback Period 8 - 9 years. Even though there are tariff adjustments, the OPS business for ships is still more efficient than using fuel. To support the use of green energy, implementing the OPS business can be supported by purchasing a Renewable Energy Certificate so that electricity transacted from the OPS is recognized as renewable energy-based energy. In this case study, only 1 (one) REC unit is needed to run an OPS with a capacity of 4Ã—250 kV A. Therefore, it needs support from various stakeholders, both from policy support and support from business actors. Â© 2024 IEEE.

TI  - Progress in remote sensing monitoring of Mangrove carbon storage; [çº¢æ ‘æž—ç¢³åº“é¥æ„Ÿç›‘æµ‹ç ”ç©¶è¿›å±•]
AB  - Mangroves are important blue carbon ecosystems that play a key role in maintaining global marine carbon cycles and mitigating the rate of climate change. Remote sensing, due to its advantages of good repeatability, high resolution, and low cost, can better facilitate the monitoring and management of mangrove carbon resources. This study reviews the research progress of remote sensing-based mangrove carbon reservoirs and categorizes the development into three stages based on the research content and depth: the early exploration stage (2007â€•2012), which primarily focused on global mangrove mapping and the extraction of spatial structural information; the midterm application research stage (2013â€•2015), which estimated mangrove carbon stocks based on previous research achievements; and the comprehensive development stage (after 2016), characterized by improving accuracy in carbon stock estimation and a research focus on the impact mechanisms of environmental factors on mangrove carbon reservoirs. The current status of optical remote sensing and radar remote sensing methods is reviewed, and the degree of improvement in results through the fusion analysis of these two remote sensing techniques is explored. Furthermore, the performance of various mangrove carbon models in estimating carbon stocks and simulating carbon cycling in mangroves is discussed. From the two important carbon reservoirs of biomass and soil in mangroves, relevant research on their carbon stocks is reviewed. The biomass carbon reservoir is primarily composed of carbon stored in vegetation roots, stems, and leaves, and it is a major influencing factor in mangrove primary productivity. However, the biomass carbon stock is highly affected by human activities and natural influences, resulting in considerable fluctuations. The soil carbon reservoir, which accounts for approximately 49%â€•98% of the total carbon stock in mangroves, is the largest carbon reservoir in mangrove ecosystems. However, research on soil carbon reservoirs is relatively limited compared to biomass carbon reservoirs, primarily due to challenges in acquiring remote sensing data and dealing with complex optical characteristics. In consideration of the crucial role of mangrove ecosystems in carbon sequestration and the achievement of carbon-related goals, the need for improvements in applying mangrove carbon sinks to carbon accounting and statistics is analyzed, and the potential applications of unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing technology and artificial intelligence in mangrove carbon stock estimation are explored.

TI  - Battery Energy Storage System Sizing Strategy for Naval Vessels through Multi-Objective Optimisation
AB  - Naval ship design must balance multiple conflicting requirements, including the need for fast response times and high speeds, often leading to large and complex hybrid propulsion systems. At the same time, the decarbonisation of ship operations and the shipping industry has become one of the most concerning topics for the maritime community. Even if the military sector has not been driven yet by this regulatory framework, decarbonisation is also becoming a hot topic for the navies. Additionally, short-term power loads encompass numerous demanding applications. The impact of this type of load on the performance of the shipboard power system influences power quality, and load levelling has been proven to be one of the critical power management strategies for new naval shipboard electric plants. Furthermore, decarbonisation and electric pulse management require pervasive automation systems to balance reduced crew sizes effectively. In recent years, Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) have emerged as effective tools for reducing green-house gas emissions, as well as for load levelling and peak shaving. These systems support power management strategies, addressing conflicting naval ship design requirements and optimising these critical concerns. BESS based hybrid propulsion is a promising solution for enhancing the energy efficiency of naval ships. It has been proven to be a reliable and flexible design option for improving the power quality of the electric grid. However, BESS requires space, weight tolerance, and cost expenditures to match all other military operational requirements in one convenient, optimal shipboard power plant. The paper outlines an optimisation-based approach to size a BESS-based hybrid propulsion architecture for naval ships, primarily focusing on reducing environmental foot print, increasing efficiency, and improving power grid reliability. The optimisation aims to minimise the ship exhaust emissions in terms of equivalent CO2. The frontline ship type case study has been analysed while ma noeuvring in restricted waters and deep seas in a given pseudo-random operating condition extracted from actual data, showing potential interest in a new, energy-efficient, and resilient solution. For comprehensive benchmarking, the case study has been further examined and discussed with different sizing configurations, and each case study has been ranked with a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The study shows that, despite the increasing size and weight of the BESS to reduce fuel consumption, analysing different solutions with a model-based strategy for the hybrid plant gives interesting trade-offs during the design phase while leaving space for new research directions.

TI  - EMISSION REDUCTION, SAFETY, AND SYSTEM REDUNDANCY: BATTERY IN OFFSHORE WIND SERVICE OPERATION VESSELS (SOV) AND OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS VESSELS
AB  - Battery implementation in offshore oil and gas vessels has been in the market for almost a decade. The battery provides system redundancy and safety and, at the same time, improves fuel efficiency and supports carbon reduction efforts in the oil and gas industry. In Offshore Wind Service Operation Vessels, use of battery technology is still relatively new and has been implemented only within the last three to five years. The battery design and actual battery operation in both industries will be compared in this article in terms of battery utilization to reduce emissions and to provide additional safety and system redundancy. The article presents data analysis of actual battery operations from both segments, Offshore Wind Service Operation Vessels and oil and gas vessels, with data collected from a Corvus visualization tool that compiles operational data from a worldwide base of installed marine battery systems. The comparisons will cover the following topics: 1) electrical design and its operation (open bus versus closed bus); 2) battery capacity; battery charge and discharge powers (kW), and respective current (Amps); and energy (kWh); 3) Emission reduction and fuel efficiency; 4) lastly, the paper will review the battery notation and approval from the class societies that dictate safety and redundancy standards for both applications. Several graphs will provide visual observations of the battery operation in both segments. Based on the data visualization, the analysis will be drawn. The study will highlight the system differences, operator familiarity with battery operation, system adoption, and daily operational usage to promote fuel efficiency and emission reduction. The paper will conclude with the importance of matching the battery design profile to the operational load profile, or actual planned system use. which can drive higher fuel efficiency and emission reduction. The battery as energy storage plays an essential role in improving energy efficiency and supporting carbon reduction efforts. Battery-powered, all-electric operations produce zero emissions and consume zero fuel, enabling Hybrid systems that leverage battery power to significantly reduce emissions and fuel use. There are specific lessons learned from battery implementation in the oil and gas industry that can be applied in the offshore wind industry to accelerate battery technology adoption. It is recommended that both industries - offshore wind and offshore oil and gas - exchange battery operational information to improve safety and redundancy and to optimize fuel efficiency, battery performance, and operational cost savings.

TI  - DIFFERENT APPROACHES FOR HYBRIDIZATION BETWEEN SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELLS AND INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES
AB  - The paper explores the hybridization of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and Internal combustion Engine (ICE), It addresses design point analysis for SOFC-ICE hybrid system applications, considering the early adoption of technology. The study investigates different design cases for a 1 MW turbocharged SOFC-ICE system for marine applications in which the SOFC's power contribution is fixed at 20% to reduce the risk and expenses associated with early technology adoption. The results show that the maximum efficiency of the SOFC-ICE system is 49.4% at 70% fuel utilization and 1.1% methane concentration at the anode inlet of SOFC. This integration provides an efficiency improvement of 5% over the standalone ICE. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the SOFC-ICE system might provide a maximum reduction in CO2 emissions of 17.6% over existing marine natural gas engines. However, the results prove the insensitivity of system efficiency to both SOFC fuel utilization and methane composition in the anode inlet. Because the system efficiency variation is no more than 1.41% or 1.1% when varying fuel utilization from 70% to 90% or varying methane concentration from 1.1% to 30.7%, respectively. Based on these findings, a SOFC-ICE hybrid system with complete external reforming and very low fuel consumption can be designed for optimal performance. Both would lengthen the SOFC stacks' lifetime and lower SOFC design complexity and cost. These results are compared to an optimized hybrid design for stationary applications where the SOFC represented between 78% and 93% of the total system power. Intuitively, optimizing the power split in the system design at the highest fuel utilization (90%) provides higher efficiencies by 13% than fixing the SOFC power share at 20%.

TI  - Advancement in Green Hydrogen Production: Integrating Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOECs) into Existing Offshore Facilities for Sustainable Energy
AB  - Hydrogen energy has been hailed as a versatile energy of the future that could aid the transition to net-zero emissions. It has large potential as an alternate fuel source for mobility and power, heating and feedstock for the industry. The energy carrier is produced from water electrolysis technology using different types of electrolyzer (i.e., Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) or Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOECs)) for hydrogen separation process. In this energy research journey, PETRONAS has jointly worked with SLB to evaluate the feasibility of using SOECs for green hydrogen production. The study's focus is to explore integrating SOECs into existing industrial facilities creating hybrid systems, specifically with available flue gas from combustion process e.g. power generation. This allows for the utilization of waste heat from existing processes to enhance overall energy efficiency in hydrogen production. To understand hydrogen production and its utilization in the existing facility, the full system including existing gas turbines, solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOECs), a hydrogen compression train, and a temperate cooling water system were modeled in a process simulation software. The model also included a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) to recover the energy from gas turbine exhaust gases to heat water feed to produce saturated steam which will be the feed to SOEC. Several configurations considering heat integrations were explored, including heat recovery from SOEC product stream. Various sensitivities were run for different configurations of the process to study hydrogen purity, hydrogen blending, overall power required, water required in the overall process, and power produced by the hydrogen generated from SOEC and CO2 emission values in all the configuration. The results were compared and evaluated to help assess how variation in parameters affect the performance or outcome. The results were evaluated for blending the produced hydrogen with the existing export gas before and after export gas compression and how it influences the hydrogen purity. Hydrogen blending with the fuel gas to the gas turbine also helped in overall reduction of CO2 emission. It was observed that additional cooling of the hydrogen stream to achieve better hydrogen purity did not significantly help in reducing CO2 emissions when hydrogen is used as fuel gas; therefore, cooling with temperate water system can be considered. All the cases were compared and evaluated for expanding the application of green hydrogen technologies in the facility considering viability and reduction in emissions. The study was a part of a collaborative research initiative by the industry players to accelerate the development and deployment of SOEC technologies in existing facilities. The results from the study provided an overall understanding of adding SOEC in the facility and valuable insights to the stakeholders to make well-informed choices on the configuration.

TI  - Site-Level Carbon Storage Potential Estimation in Offshore China
AB  - To counteract the trend of global warming and to achieve the objective of "net zero emissions by 2050", many countries are conducting pilot research projects or experiments on carbon storage by exploring the technologies and practices for future deployment. One of the most critical elements for carbon storage is the storage capacity. Many previous authors have proposed their own methods to evaluate storage capacity in the saline aquifer environment, yet those methods are mainly designed for basin or depression-level evaluations. Because the methods vary from each other significantly make them impractical for a site-level storage capacity evaluation. The work this paper presents aims to estimate the storage capacity by means of a geoengineering approach in the site-level with an actual offshore China example. The key components of this approach include creating the geology and geomechanical model, evaluating the containment properties, and estimating the barrier stress conditions, etc. Considering the actual geology model properties and the dominant saline aquifer storage mechanisms, the authors chose multiple hot areas to conduct reservoir simulations with carbon dioxide injection, where saturation attack tactics were used to withdraw the storage efficiency factor and maximum capacity in different scenarios. This approach eventually allowed the authors to evaluate the true capacity of this site. This paper provides a systematic example of evaluating carbon storage capacity in the site level. The geoengineering approach also covers optimization of the injectivity and the containment of the barriers with an actual example, which is an important supplement to the existing carbon dioxide storage method, which focused mainly on the large-scale evaluation. Because this site-level workflow drops down to the actual geology and geomechanical environment, it may well prove better value towards the implementation of CO2 injection planning, operation, and monitoring in the later stages.

While significant attention has been placed on vessels exceeding 5,000 gross tons (GT), emissions from coastal and short sea shipping, amounting to approximately 13% of global shipping transportation and 15% within the European Union (EU), have not received adequate consideration. This abstract introduces the Zero Emission Sea Transporter (ZEST) project, designed to address this issue by developing a zero-emissions multi-purpose catamaran for short sea routes, shown in Figure 1.

TI  - Social impact assessment of biofuel production for maritime and aviation sectors: a case study of a pilot biorefinery project
AB  - This work presents a comprehensive Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) and Social Cost-Benefit Analysis (S-CBA) conducted as part of a research project, studying biofuel production for the maritime and aviation sectors, from various types of non-food waste biomasses. The inclusion of social considerations complements and expands on the environmental and economic ones. The importance of social group criteria was determined through expert questionnaires, leading to the identification of social impacts groups and social criteria from stakeholders across participating countries. The results successfully identified and quantified social impacts, and align with those reported in similar cases in relevant literature. Social Cost-Benefits, monetarizing social factors, demonstrated several social benefits, including reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions. However, it also highlighted social costs, such as Economic Costs associated with the initial investment. The study revealed critical social hotspots within the impact categories, making significant strides in understanding the social impacts of biofuel production, providing valuable insights for decision-makers, and contributing to the broader goal of sustainable and socially responsible biofuel production.

TI  - Screening Depleted Reservoirs and Aquifers for CO2 Geo-Sequestration, and Assessing Implications for Converting an Offshore Platform for Carbon Capture and Storage Project
AB  - Re-using the depleted reservoirs for CO2 storage offers advantages over saline aquifers, as the geological characteristics required for CO2 storage have been pre-determined with high accuracy throughout the reservoir production life, plus a proof of secure containment. Additionally, re-using the production facilities and offshore platforms for the injection of CO2 would be economically and environmentally winning fact. This paper is based on intensive bibliographic research related to challenges and concerns of CO2 storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, for the selection of the optimum solution for converting the offshore platform GREEN1 in the Adriatic Sea to be re-used instead of decommissioning. It also highlights the interactions between the reservoir parameters and the design of surface facilities. The design of all the upstream components, i.e., transportation pipeline diameter, compression capacity, and maximum allowable pressure is mainly based on the rock and fluid interactions in the reservoir porous media. Storage capacity has a pivotal role in the candidate sites screening process, accompanied by an economic feasibility study. CO2 storage capacity of 'Porto Corsini Mare' reservoir, as a candidate site for GREEN1, is estimated based on returning the depleted reservoir to its initial pressure before production. A methodology for comparing and selecting suitable reservoirs and aquifers for CO2 geo-storage is introduced in this paper for the purpose of identifying the optimum storage site for GREEN1 platform. The screening criterion is divided into three main categories: storage capacity, injectivity, and containment, in a shape of logic flow charts with the relevant parameters to each category, in order to help analysts and decision makers identify and compare candidate sites for CO2 storage, so that they are easily able to exclude the unsuitable reservoirs and proceed with the right candidates for further economic and risk assessment studies.

TI  - A Design-Driven Approach to Emissions Quantification through Digital and Domain Integration
AB  - The energy industry has been taking transformative actions to achieve sustainable growth. Specifically, hydraulic fracturing and associated activities are known to be emissions intensive. The objective here is to develop a digital tool that enables quick, efficient, error-free carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions footprint assessments for various job types. The workflows implemented in the tool cover different phases in the intervention and stimulation life cycle of a well. The application's architecture is composed of generic modular assessments, such as resource utilization, site execution, and post-job activities. The user experience focuses on simple domain workflows in which complex processes are embedded to automate the corresponding emissions calculations. Detailed emissions factors for different fuel types are utilized from US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data. The engine first identifies the baseline fuel consumption related to product transportation, equipment mobilization and demobilization, execution at wellsite, and related well cleanup or flaring. The baseline uses historical consumption data, but it goes through a calibration loop based on real-time consumption data tracking. With the emissions factors and fuel efficiency, the second step of the engine is to calculate the CO2 emissions related to the fuel quantity and type. The tool incorporates eight different fuel types and multiple publicly available gas compositions from various basins. The application organically integrates with expansive master data systems such as fluid, proppant, and equipment databases. Moreover, users can seamlessly import design details in one click from other stimulation and intervention design software. Multiple workflows can then be generated to sensitize fluid volume, proppant mass, job type, fuel type, technologies, digital innovations, etc. The current interface captures detailed workflows for conventional and unconventional operations in land and offshore environments. It also supports utilization of an electric fleet. With this digital solution, we are well positioned to (1) accelerate the decarbonizing initiative and (2) position new technology portfolios to transition to cleaner operations. Current implementation showed the impact of technologies such as channel fracturing, retarded acid systems, degradable chemistry, and various predictive models and is positioned to enable smart strategies by integrating sustainability assessment and metrics to drive business growth. Real cases from some geographies show enablement of 20 to 30% emissions reduction. This novel effort is now extended to collaborate with engineering and supply chain teams for real-time measurements, post-job actual emissions calibration, and embodied carbon of material to measure accurately the path to net zero.

TI  - Successful Story in Offshore EOR Full Field Development (Shengli - CB22F), Production Increase, Energy Savings!
AB  - This paper presents the implementation of chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR) on the offshore platform CB22F, detailing its impact over three years and proposing improvements for future deployments. It discusses the project's effects, such as increased oil production, reduced water cut, and lowered CO2 emissions, while sharing insights for optimizing future CEOR designs on two newly sanctioned platforms. The CEOR strategy on CB22F has shown significant outcomes, demonstrated by an increase in oil production, a reduction in water cut, and a decrease in CO2 emissions. Oil production increased by 663 of barrels per day (b/d), the water cut decreased from 90% to 80.5%, reducing the volumes of water handled. This decrease in water cut lowered energy consumption for water pumping and chemical treatment costs for produced water, leading to a reduction in cost and CO2 emissions to produce one barrel of oil. The test area began showing positive effects by June 2021, with a significant decrease in water content in produced fluids in 2022 and a rapid increase in oil output. By the end of March 2024, the water cut stabilized around 80.5%, and the cumulative oil increase from the 44 effective production wells reached 3, 800, 000 barrels, corresponding to a 4.27% increase in oil recovery. This cumulative increase translates to 28.9 tons of oil per ton of polymer injected, indicating the project's economic viability. Building on the success of CB22F, CEOR will be implemented on two newly sanctioned platforms with designs incorporating improvements learned from CB22F's experience. Bulk polymer delivery via pneumatic transfer will mitigate hoisting risks, improve occupational health, increase offshore storage capacity, and reduce delivery rotations, thus decreasing CO2 emissions associated with logistic operations. An integrated injection system will involve a centralized polymer injection system on the main platform, facilitating efficient distribution to both main and satellite platforms. The introduction of new Conical Pressure Reducer (CPR) skids, equipped with low shear valves, will regulate injection pressure, and adapt the polymer concentration for individual wells, minimizing polymer degradation and footprint compared to conventional methods. To address higher polymer/surfactant concentrations in produced fluids, concerns regarding emulsification are being managed through the development of new, high-efficiency water clarifiers. These improvements, guided by CB22F's experience, are expected to further optimize CEOR performance and efficiency on future platforms. This paper provides insights for engineers by demonstrating a successful CEOR implementation with concrete results and data, sharing practical improvements for future CEOR designs on offshore platforms, addressing potential challenges, and proposing viable solutions. Additionally, it contributes to knowledge on CO2 reduction strategies in oil and gas production, highlighting the environmental benefits alongside the financial gains. The reduction in CO2 emissions per barrel of oil produced underscores the broader impact of the project beyond immediate financial gains, contributing to the long-term sustainability of oil production operations.

TI  - Sustainable seawater sea-sand concrete materials and structures
AB  - Excessive consumption of fresh water and river-sand has become one of the critical challenges for sustainable development of concrete. Using seawater sea-sand concrete (SSC) in constructing coastal and marine infrastructures holds excellent potential for alleviating resource depletion, protecting river ecology, and reducing project costs as well as carbon emissions due to long-distance transportation. However, steel corrosion induced by endogenous chloride ions in SSC restricts its application to traditional reinforced concrete structures. This chapter introduces the research findings on hydration, microstructures, fresh properties, mechanical properties, shrinkage, and durability of SSC, highlighting the influence of seawater and sea-sand as well as the approaches employed to address steel corrosion in SSC. Subsequently, novel sustainable concrete, including coral aggregate concrete, recycled aggregate concrete, alkali-activated concrete, and ultra-high performance concrete, employing seawater and sea-sand are presented, aiming to improve the sustainability of SSC materials. SSC structural applications are described, including SSC structures reinforced with stainless steel/fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars, SSC-filled stainless steel/FRP tubes, and SSC wrapped with FRP. The future challenges of SSC materials and structures are also discussed. Â© 2024 by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - AlterNatives to Blue Carbon Coloniality : An Ê»ÅŒiwi Perspective on Redirecting Funding to Indigenous Stewardship
AB  - The Blue Carbon sequestration potential of marine photosynthesizers is being pursued as a nature-based climate change mitigation strategy, yet the commercial, industrial, and colonial aspects of these projects are instead resulting in a perpetuation of climate colonialism. Specifically, narrow ecosystem services accounting leads to perverse prioritization of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) over holistic socialâ€“ecological health, carbon offsets provide cover for the continuation of extractive corporate and colonial operations, industrial-scale interventions result in negative socialâ€“ecological disruptions, and even small-scale non-Indigenous projects exacerbate the loss of Indigenous coastal sovereignty. Therefore, funding and labor toward colonial Blue Carbon projects is ultimately counterproductive to holistic socialâ€“ecological vitality and should be re-directed toward the full-scale restoration of Indigenous aquaculture and coastal cultivation practices (within sovereign socialâ€“ecological systems). Moreover, since Blue Carbon and other ecosystem services should be considered a co-benefit of Indigenous stewardship and restoration, their funding should not be dictated by colonial monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) requirements. These conclusions are discussed within the global context, while also grounded in HawaiÊ»i through Kanaka Ê»ÅŒiwi (Native Hawaiian) worldviews. Ultimately, these ongoing and practical Indigenous alternatives to Blue Carbon and climate coloniality must be urgently prioritized to achieve a decarbonized and decolonized world.

TI  - Study of CO2 Hydrate Formation in Saline Water for Oceanic CO2 Sequestration
AB  - Global warming and greenhouse gas emission hasÂ increased rapidly in the recent decades, which hasÂ lead to severe consequences such as global warming, rising sea levels, and permafrost depletion. One of the possible solutions to confront the global warming issue is to store greenhouse CO2 in oceanic conditions in the form of gas hydrates. Large-scale CO2 capture and storage technologies can restrict global temperature rise below 2Â Â°C in next 30Â years. Gas hydrates are ice-like structures that are capable to store metric tons of CO2 in subsea conditions. The storage of CO2 into gas hydrates is a front runner among other sequestration as reemission of CO2 into the environment is difficult. In this current study, hydrate formation kinetics has been tested in high-pressure continuous stirred tank reactorÂ (CSTR), mimicking actual subsea temperature and pressure conditions. Our research contributes to the understanding of the behavior of CO2 hydrates formation kinetics in seawater and advances our ability to model and predict the formation and dissociation. The experiment was conducted in a 1400Â ml high-pressure continuous stirred tank reactor with experimental pressure and temperature condition of 4.58Â MPa and 274.15Â K. Our experimental studies demonstrates that salinity has an inhibitory effect on CO2 hydrate formationÂ kinetics. The kinetics of CO2 hydrate formation were examined in seawater conditions and pure waterÂ and our findings demonstrate that several variables, including pressure, temperature, salinity, and stirring rate, have an impact on the rate of CO2 hydrate formation. These findings can inform the design and improvement of hydrate-based CCS technologies by offering useful insights into the mechanism of CO2 sequestration in the form ofÂ hydrates in oceans.

TI  - An ensemble learning model for ship fuel consumption prediction
AB  - In order to fulfill the responsibilities of international Maritime environmental protection and respond to the national "dual carbon"strategic policy, as well as to cope with the rising fuel prices, the relevant research on ship energy saving and emission reduction technologies has gradually received the attention of the International Maritime Organization. The focus of relevant organizations such as IMO, national maritime authorities and shipowners. In the context of shipping data, the effective use of ship energy consumption monitoring data to accurately predict ship operation energy consumption is becoming more and more important to achieve shipping energy conservation and emission reduction, and also an effective means to respond to national strategies. From the perspective of energy saving, it relies on the pycharm platform, analyzes and preprocesses multiple types of open source data collected during the actual voyage of a passenger ship, establishes the system input features, and the ship fuel consumption prediction model based on the Stacking model. The prediction results are compared with those single model. The advantage of the integrated learning model of Stacking is proved.  Â© COPYRIGHT SPIE.

TI  - How Reactor Scale Affects Nuclear Power Plants Siting in Saudi Arabia
AB  - Saudi Arabia plans to diversify its energy sector by focusing on low-carbon generation and nuclear energy is being explored in this context. Siting Nuclear Power Plants necessitates careful consideration of many factors such as water access, hazard exposure, proximity to anticipated load, and possible coproduct generation (e.g., desalination). Existing studies have only explored large light water reactors and identified limited coastal sites as possible due to consequent water requirements. However, small and micro modular reactors could mitigate this issue and open up a larger swath of the country. Here, we consider the added potential for nuclear when considering different sizes of reactors. We perform country-scale geospatial analyses at high resolution, using multiple reactor scales and corresponding criteria following internationally recognized guidelines. We identify viable sites across Saudi Arabia, and we show that decreasing the size of the reactors significantly increase the potential locations of nuclear power plants. We use existing infrastructure density to indicate the most economically promising sites. The power and siting flexibility of smaller reactors makes them good candidates to replace existing power generation infrastructure. This path can help Saudi Arabia develop a successful civilian nuclear program. Â© The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

TI  - NUTRACEUTICAL POTENTIAL OF MARINE MACROALGAE
AB  - Macroalgae or seaweeds contribute a significant role in the marine ecosystem. Seaweeds generally have a high growth rate, CO2Â sequester potential, and biomass composition and also do not demand freshwater, arable land, fertilizers for growth which makes them an attractive alternate bioresource for food, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, fertilizer, biochemicals, and biofuel applications. In many countries, seaweed has been used as food for decades, because of its health and nutritional benefits. Seaweeds contain several bioactive components like macronutrients, micronutrients, proteins, vitamins, sulfated polysaccharides, and antioxidants with proven nutraceutical and biological properties which are found useful against diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity, and other disorders. Additionally, these environmentally friendly natural products derived from macroalgae have also been recognized for immune-stimulating and anti-microbial properties. In recent years, food industries have begun to use seaweed components to 230prevent food contamination and thus ensure food safety. Seaweeds have been thoroughly investigated for nutraceutical applications and efforts are still ongoing to derive new products with a variety of health benefits or as a natural remedy for therapeutic application. This chapter provides detailed information on seaweeds and their potential applications, bioactive components of seaweeds with nutritional potentials, and future prospective.

TI  - Seagrass blue carbon stocks and air-sea CO2fluxes in seagrass meadows Jepara, Indonesia
AB  - This research was conducted on August 2022 (east season) and February 2023 (west season) in Jepara waters. There are four types of seagrasses found: Ea (Enhalus acoroides), Cr (Cymodocea rotundata), Os (Oceana serrulata), and Th (Thalassia hemprichii). The analysis results suggest that the Os species has the largest organic carbon stock within seagrass (OCS-Sg), whereas Ea has the lowest. Aside from morphological measures, in this study seagrass shoot density also determined OCS-Sg for each type of seagrass. This study found that OCS-Sg is higher during the east season (26.2Â±2.81 gCorg m-2) than the west season (11.2Â±1.78 gCorg m-2). Whereas, organic carbon stock within sediment (OCS-S) is lower during the east season (41.5Â±0.9 gCorg m-2) and higher during the west season (56.3Â±0.9 gCorg m-2). During the east and west seasons, Jepara waters act as a CO2 source. However, during the east and west seasons vegetated OCS-S had higher carbon storage (41.9 and 57.2 gCorg m-2) than unvegetated (39.2 and 53.7 gCorg m-2). This is also indicated by the CO2 flux in vegetated which is lower (13.1Â±4.8 mmol CO2 m-2 d-1) than unvegetated (16.5Â±4.7 mmol CO2 m-2 d-1) during the east season. On the other hand, vegetated waters have higher CO2 flux (22.7Â±2.7 mmol CO2 m-2 d-1) in the west season than unvegetated (18.0Â±2.5 mmol CO2 m-2 d-1), this is related to seagrass shoot density during the west season which is decreasing. These findings lead to the conclusion that seagrass plays an important role for storing and absorbing carbon and storing carbon and store it in seagrass biomass and sediment even though the role of waters returns CO2 back to the atmosphere.

TI  - Comprehensive analysis for assessing the renewable energy integration on a research ship vessel in India
AB  - Using onboard renewable energy resources, marine fuel consumption can be optimised to yield emission reduction and fuel cost savings. This paper proposes a methodology for accurate assessment of integrating PV and energy storage to a marine Indian TARA research vessel. This Indian vessel has only diesel generation and batteries to meet propeller demands, lighting and communication loads. In this paper, the net system is estimated with solar PV for minimising carbon emissions. The installation of solar PV in maximum available space in research vessel is estimated considering the panel dimensions and actual demand profile of vessel is analysed for integrating solar PV and battery systems. A novel method is adopted for estimating annual vessel-demand and PV-power generation. Using demand and generation data, the onboard fuel consumption is optimised using PV and battery by an optimal dispatch scheme that includes a Minimum Generator Operation with N-1 safety constraint. The fuel savings after integration of solar PV and battery in vessel are analysed, and net present value and cost to emission savings after renewable energy integration are studied considering real-time load profile and vessel movement. Finally, based on optimal dispatch results, factors that affect fuel savings are examined and overall investigation findings are summarised.

TI  - How Can Shipping Companies Manage Environmentally Beneficial Operations in a Sustainable Way?
AB  - The shipping industry, integral to global trade, faces a paradox as a major contributor to both economic development and environmental degradation. With over 90% of world trade reliant on shipping, the sector's dependence on fossil fuels raises concerns about air pollution and climate change. In response, environmental regulations have evolved, led by bodies like the International Maritime Organization (IMO), aiming to steer the industry towards greener practices. This study explores the multifaceted challenges posed by shipping's environmental impact, focusing on emissions and ship dismantling. Analyzing IMO's green shipping strategy and the types of emissions, the study emphasizes the significance of countering environmental degradation. It delves into proposed countermeasures, including speed reduction, renewable energy adoption, and advanced monitoring systems, highlighting the role of technology in achieving sustainability. Additionally, the study scrutinizes the ship dismantling process, acknowledging its benefits in recycling materials but underscoring environmental and human hazards. The involvement of official bodies, such as the IMO and the European Union, in shaping regulations for sustainable ship recycling is discussed. The study concludes by advocating for stringent international regulations, emphasizing the slow yet transformative nature of industry adaptation, and the imperative for sustained commitment to global sustainability in shipping.

TI  - Environmental Benefits of Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Smart Ports via Implementation of Smart Energy Infrastructure
AB  - According to the European management of marine spaces platforms "Green airports and ports as multimodal hubs for sustainable and intelligent mobility" set up, every seaport must show the incorporation of low-emission power generation and provision into its terminal and power infrastructure, including facilities for storing, distributing, and refilling vessels and other transportation with green alternative fuels., and other uses. Smart seaports also balance energy demand and supply through intelligent management based on the Internet of Things (IoTs). Furthermore, seaports must reduce internal port border energy consumption or use renewable energy in compliance with ISO 50001 and Port Energy Management Plans. As a result, smart seaports use energy management systems (EMS) to balance energy generation, transfer, distribution, and consumption principles to move toward sustainable seaports. The characteristics of minimizing the seaport's greenhouse gas (GHG) emission using EMSs are investigated in this study. The technique includes a "scoping review" and extensive linked resource investigation. The sections and various components of an EMS and their functions in smart ports are next examined in the "finding." Finally, the "conclusion" section includes scientific insights, ideas, and proposals for improving the impact and functions of the ports' energy management services toward port sustainability, as well as some recommendations for further research.

TI  - Exploring CO2-H2S Storage in Deep Saline Aquifers: A Case Study from an Offshore Gas Field in Malaysia. From Lab to Numerical Simulation
AB  - Most carbon dioxide (CO2) storage schemes rely on storing CO2 in its supercritical state, free from impurities (SNC-Lavalin Inc., 2004). The X field reservoir model, like many other existing reservoir models, assumes pure CO2 injection for its numerical simulation of CO2 storage. However, one of the gas sample analyses from the X field revealed the presence of trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H2S,) ranging from 500 to 1000 ppm. Given the limitations of the separation technology, there is a potential scenario where CO2 might be co-injected with H2S for storage. Understanding the impact of this H2S within the injected CO2 stream is crucial for ensuring the success of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) operations (Basava-Reddi et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011). There is a possibility of CO2 being co-injected with this H2S for storage. The effect of the contaminant in the injected CO2 stream needs to be accessed to ensure the success of the CCS operation. The alterations in the base CO2 solubility can ultimately influence storage integrity and capacity (Ahmad et al., 2023). While abundant solubility data for CO2 in water or brine exist in the literature (A Chapoy et al., 2004; Valtz et al., 2004; Ahmadi & Chapoy, 2018), limited data are available for this ternary CO2- H2S-Brine system. Therefore, the need to quantify the impact of H2S impurities on CO2 solubility is evident. In this context, extensive laboratory experiments were undertaken to address these uncertainties and further refine the X field dynamic model for enhanced accuracy.

TI  - Near Well Supercritical CO2 Injectivity Study in Depleted Clastic Gas Field in Offshore Malaysia
AB  - PETRONAS is committed to reduce the bulk carbon dioxide (CO2) emission to the atmosphere by re-injecting the produced CO2 from high CO2 gas field to nearby identified storage site. One of the most important components to develop the storage site would be the understanding on the CO2 injectivity potential. Limited study is identified for near well CO2 injectivity research especially in determining the critical velocity rate to identify the injectivity potential during supercritical CO2 injection (scCO2). In this paper, the injection potential for Field D, which is in Offshore Malaysia has been studies for the storage prospect maturation purposes. Two representative sandstone samples with two distinctive permeability (~80 mD and ~300 mD) from the targeted injected zone in Field D were selected for the analysis. The initially brine saturated core sample was injected with scCO2 at fixed flowrate to establish the core at irreducible brine saturation. ScCO2 was then injected at slightly higher flowrate until the stable differential pressure is achieved. For each subsequent increases in flow rate, base rate of scCO2 is implied in the intervals to observe if there is any formation damage occurred in laminar flow regime. Relative Injectivity Coefficient (RIC) was also calculated using the returned rate differential pressure information. Furthermore, pre- and post-injection core characterization, using routine core analysis (RCA) and X-Ray CT-scan were conducted to examine any petrophysical alteration that might take place during the experiment. The critical velocity rate is then analyzed according to the differential pressure data which later upscaled to well-scale resolution. Based on the differential pressure trend from the two injectivity experiments, there is no clear evidence of formation damage even after the core has been subjected to high scCO2 lab flowrate (~110 cc/min). Only minor dissolution and fines flush-out was occurred. This observation is confirmed by pre- and post-scCO2 injectivity analyses comparison where the petrophysical changes is very minimal. Based on the evidence from differential pressure and pre- and post-sample characteristics, it can be concluded that the critical flow rates were higher than the maximum achievable laboratory flow rates. This denotes that there is no injectivity issues that is expected to occur up to upscaled well flowrate of 18.5 MMscf/day during the CO2 injection in storage target zone in Field D.

TI  - Co2 Absorption Inside the Wellbore for Oil Wells
AB  - The concepts and design precautions for a proposed in-situ electricity generation project including the main goal which is related to reducing the environmental pollution due to the combustion of fossil fuels and emitting carbon dioxide (CO2). This reduction will be attained through a smart gas well design and completion. The design is based on in-situ combustion for a gas flow in a downhole combustion chamber. Oxy-fuel combustion technique is the proposed combustion technique due to the ease of CO2 separation in this process as shown in figure 1. The proper well design will be analogous to the wells used for in-situ oil combustion to handle the high released temperature. Power generation design will combine the fundamentals of geothermal energy deployment for electricity generation. Finally, the produced CO2 from the combustion process will be reinjected downhole into an underground geological structure after being compressed and transferred to the supercritical phase. This process eliminates the CO2 production to the surface and hence reduce the environmental pollution. Copyright Â© 2024, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Impacts of landscape fragmentation of coastal zone on carbon sequestration service flow; [æµ·å²¸å¸¦æ™¯è§‚ç ´ç¢ŽåŒ–å¯¹å›ºç¢³æœåŠ¡æµçš„å½±å“]
AB  - As one of the long-term solutions to the global climate change problem, the harmonious dynamic relationship between supply and demand of blue carbon is of great significance in promoting regional carbon balance and sustainable management. With the rapid socioeconomic development, the landscape fragmentation of the coastal zone is significant, which directly affects the ecological processes such as energy flow and material circulation in its system. However, the effects of coastal zone landscape fragmentation on the supply- demand relationship and flow of carbon sequestration services are not clear. Based on the framework of the impact of coastal landscape fragmentation on carbon sequestration service flow, this study synthesizes land use data, carbon storage sampling data and nighttime light data, and employs the moving window method, the InVEST model and the network model to conduct an empirical study in the Liaohe River Delta, a typical silty coastal zone in northern China. The results show that: (1) From 1995 to 2020, with the intensification of landscape fragmentation in the Liaohe River Delta, the demand for carbon sequestration services increased by 30.44 million tons and the supply of carbon sequestration services increased and then decreased, with the overall change being insignificant, and the difference between the supply and demand of carbon sequestration services increased from 4.49 million tons in 1995 to 33.76 million tons in 2020. (2) The negative impact of landscape fragmentation on the carbon sequestration service flow varied among different anthropogenic intensity, with more pronounced impact on agricultural reclamation areas, increasing and then decreasing impact on industrial port reclamation areas, while little impact on reed wetlands. (3) The impact of landscape fragmentation on the spatial pattern of carbon sequestration service flow is reflected in the density and connectivity of carbon sequestration service flow network, interrupting service flow and changing the direction of service flow. (4) The reed protection areas and agricultural reclamation areas have important ecological functions, and ecological red line should be strictly controlled to enhance carbon sequestration capacity. The industrial port reclamation areas should strengthen the construction of ecological corridors to enhance landscape connectivity and restore carbon sink function. This study reveals the relationship between landscape fragmentation and carbon sequestration service flow, and the results can provide scientific basis and management reference for ecological restoration and carbon sequestration capacity enhancement in China's conservation strategic key areas and other similar silt coastal zones around the world.

TI  - Carbon Dioxide Gas Adsorption on Eagle Ford Shale for Assessing CO2 Storage Potential
AB  - Shale formations have the potential to store a considerable amount of CO2 through gas adsorption in the shale matrix. This work aims to investigate the effects of total organic carbon content, pressure and temperature on adsorption capacity of Eagle Ford shales. This study involved the determination of void volume of two shale samples (EF A and EF B) with varying TOC and the determination of their CO2 adsorption capacity at varying pressure of 2 MPa - 10 MPa and varying temperature of 40Â°C and 60Â°C. The study employed a volumetric approach to examine the CO2 gas adsorption on shale samples. Results indicated that shales with higher TOC content have higher CO2 adsorption capacity, making shale formations with more organic matter to be potential candidates for CO2 storage. Overall, TOC, pressure and temperature played a significant role in CO2 adsorption capacity of the shale samples. Copyright Â© 2024, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Seagrass Aboveground Carbon Stock Mapping using PlanetScope SuperDove Imagery in Nemberala, Rote Island, East Nusa Tenggara
AB  - Seagrass ecosystem is natural objects that can be used to adapt and mitigate climate change through blue carbon sequestration. There are 16 seagrass species in Indonesia and the high diversity of these species supports the high potential of carbon that can be absorbed and stored. This study aimed to develop a general equation to estimate seagrass aboveground carbon stock (AGC) from the percent cover (PC), and to map seagrass AGC using PlanetScope imagery in Nemberala, Rote Island. Nemberala has very diverse seagrass species such as Enhalus acoroides (Ea), Cymodocea rotundata (Cr), Halophila ovalis (Ho), Syringodium isoetifolium (Si), Thalassodendron ciliatum (Tc) and Thalassia hemprichii (Th). The results of laboratory analysis to obtain the value of carbon stocks using the Loss on Ignition method from each species were 0.016, 0.004, 0.001, 0.002, 0.001, and 0.0001 (gC/leaf) for Ea, Th, Cr, Si, Tc, and Ho, respectively. The general equation for predicting AGC from PC is SeagrassAGC = (0.051*SeagrassPC) â€“ 0.635 with r of 0.61 and R2 of 0.36. This formula will be applied to convert field seagrass PC data to AGC, which will then be used to train and test the accuracy of seagrass AGC mapping based on PlanetScope SuperDove 8 bands image.

AB  - ï¼šCoastal zones are both ecologically fragile and "outposts" for low-carbon agricultural development. The promotion and development of carbon-neutral agriculture is in line with the needs of the times and the concept of green and sustainable development. Based on this, this paper describes the issues related to the development of carbon-neutral agriculture in coastal zones. Firstly, this paper explains the mechanism of sea-land interaction and the concept of carbon-neutral agriculture development in coastal zones. Then, it analyzes the carbon-neutral agricultural organisms, artificial photosynthesis, and agricultural promotion in the carbon-neutral agricultural driving in coastal zones as well as the engineering application of the concept. Finally, the paper provides insights into how to identify core carbon sinks in coastal zone agriculture, including in situ monitoring, isotope labeling, and statistical analysis methods. On this basis, the technology of agricultural carbon sink enhancement is proposed to provide a reference for the subsequent development and promotion of carbon-neutral agriculture in the coastal zone and its practical application. It can also promote the protection of fragile coastal zone ecosystems and the development of green and low-carbon agriculture. Â© 2024 Editorial Board of Journal of Agro-Environment Science.

TI  - Revamping Seaport Operations with Renewable Energy: A Sustainable Approach to Reducing Carbon Footprint
AB  - Objective seven of the Sustainable Development Goals states that everyone needs sustainable energy to reach 2050. As stated in Goal 13, global climate change reduction actions are crucial. A recent health board investigation indicated that seaport and ship emissions cause 19000 lung cancer cases and nearly 60,000 pollution-related deaths. The UNâ€™s annual maritime transport study predicts 961 million tons of CO2eq from maritime transport. However, less fossil fuel consumption leads to less air pollution and climate change, so a stable relationship exists between managing energy use and reducing air pollution, which mitigates climate change. Seaports, as essential nodes of global transport and a critical part of the maritime industry, began to deploy Energy Management Systems to manage energy use and move toward replacing fossil fuel energies with renewables. This study is a thorough scoping review of utilizing renewable energy in ports, as well as an evaluation of the strategy for achieving this goal and the impact of this goal on lowering the carbon footprint in seaports. The finding describes recent research by category and policy trends toward port sustainability via renewable energy. Finally, in conclusion, the data presented is used to analyze the process of establishing and increasing this phenomenon and to make relevant recommendations.

On this basis, the mathematical model with the time window constraint is further constructed by adding the time window constraint and fully considering some factors in the transportation of inland vessels that cannot be ignored, such as fuel price, carbon tax price and sailing speed. Finally, the impact of fuel, charter, and carbon tax prices on the optimization scheme is analyzed by the sensitivity analysis method. With the lowest total sailing cost as the target, the total sailing cost of the whole voyage is reduced by $4,749, which is 3.75% less than last year. Optimization with the lowest carbon emission as the goal, the whole voyage CO2 emissions reduced by 4.22t, a year-on-year reduction of 10.76%. Considering the total voyage cost and carbon emission for multi-objective optimization, the total voyage cost is reduced by 1210, which is 0.91% less than the same period last year. Therefore, the speed optimization method for inland sea vessels based on the C-W saving algorithm can provide a basis for shipowners and speed companies in making sailing plans.

TI  - How depositional environment affects CO2 injectivity in saline aquifers
AB  - Assessing a hydrocarbon reservoir for development involves using various types of data including seismic acquisitions, analogue production data, and exploration/offset well data. In contrast, assessing saline aquifers for CO2 injection is typically constrained by limited project finances and lack of previous exploration and production experience. As a result, there is a high level of uncertainty regarding depositional environment and the resulting effect of this on CO2 injectivity. The lack of knowledge about a saline aquiferâ€™s depositional environment and architecture poses risks when estimating its storage efficiency. These risks may include injecting into isolated compartments or low-quality areas, which can lead to low storage efficiency and faster pressure development. For instance, the stratigraphically-compartmentalized fluvial TubÃ¥en Formation in SnÃ¸hvit field of Barents Sea restricted CO2 plume and pressure development. This study employs a stochastic approach to examine how depositional environment impacts storage capacity, injectivity, and pressure development in CO2 sequestration through reservoir simulations. Additionally, this research analyses how depositional environment drives CO2 and pressure plume migration during injection and soaking in periods. The study contributes important insights into assessing geological formations for CO2 storage and optimising deposition-specific limitations and effects.

TI  - ECONOMIC-ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF CONCENTRATED SOLAR POWER FOR SEAWATER DESALINATION
AB  - Concentrated solar powered-desalination technology can be used to desalinate water which will resolve water scarcity and minimize the negative impact of fossil fuels on our planet. In this regard, this study aims to fulfill the demand for freshwater and reduce air pollution generated by water desalination by replacing fossil fuels with concentrating solar power. Different energy scenarios including full grid, Concentrated Solar Power (CSP), and CSP-grid have been explored to assess the potential of running Reverse Osmosis (RO) desalination. The assessment was examined with the help of System Advisor Model (SAM) and Desalination Economic Evaluation Program (DEEP) software. SAM enables the design of a concentrated solar energy plant and demonstrates the plant's performance, while DEEP permits the design of a water desalination unit and its integration with a concentrated solar power plant. The three scenarios have been evaluated from economic and environmental perspectives. It is found that the CSP technology is not economically feasible for running desalination compared to using fossil fuel, however, taking into consideration removing fuel subsidized and greenhouse gas emissions reduction, the CSP is an appealing option as greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by 96% compared to the grid.

TI  - Sustainable and Cost-Effective Management of Residual Aquatic Seaweed Biomass. Business Opportunity for Seaweeds Biorifineries
AB  - The global seaweed market has been experiencing significant growth in recent years due to the increasing demand for seaweed-based products in various industries. It is influenced by several factors, including increasing consumer awareness of the nutritional and health benefits of seaweeds, growing demand for natural and sustainable products, and advancements in seaweed cultivation techniques. Due to their large biomass yields and fast growth rate, seaweeds have gained much attention as promising biopower and biomaterial feedstocks nowadays. Managing residual aquatic seaweed biomass in a sustainable and cost-effective manner requires a comprehensive approach that considers both environmental considerations and economic feasibility. In comparison to terrestrial crops previously considered as favorable feedstocks, macroalgae offer certain advantages in the biorefinery because the latter facilitates the extraction of different constituents ensuring full utilization of the biomass and generating fewer residues through a succession of steps. Thus, an interest in macroalgae biorefinery is increasing since it would solve both environmental and economic drawbacks of terrestrial biomass biorefinery. However, seaweed biorefinery concept is more recent and less mature than from terrestrial biomass. It means that the technologies applied for one could not be efficient for seaweeds and new developments need to be explored for the full utilization of macroalgae. Several strategies are presented in this chapter, and based on can be achieved a balance between sustainable management of residual seaweed biomass and cost-effective utilization, ensuring the long-term viability of seaweed as a valuable resource. However, with ongoing research and advancements in technology, seaweed biorefineries have a promising future in contributing to sustainable industries and addressing environmental and societal challenges. The concept of seaweeds biorefinery aligns with the principles of the biobased economy, which seeks to replace fossil-based products with sustainable alternatives. It promotes resource efficiency, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and contributes to the development of a more sustainable and circular economy.

TI  - CSEM Monitoring of CO2 Storage with Wellbores as Antennas
AB  - In the context of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) utilizing existing well infrastructure, we study the electromagnetic (EM) signals produced by a CO2 plume injected in the reservoir when the well casing is excited via a dipole on the seafloor in a Controlled Source Electromagnetics (CSEM) survey. We perform simulations with the Finite Element Method (FEM), testing the sensitivity of the signal at the seafloor to different configurations for the material properties of the reservoir. Results point at a complex interaction of the fields with the spatial distribution of CO2 and formation layers, leading to complex signal at the seafloor which carry information from the reservoir.

TI  - Sea of opportunities: unravelling the impact of cluster-based blue entrepreneurship and blue technology penetration on seaweed export propensity
AB  - Seaweed export from Bangladesh holds significant potential for economic growth and export diversification. Cluster-based blue entrepreneurship emerges as a promising strategy to bolster seaweed exports. This study explores the determinants of seaweed export propensity in Bangladesh, drawing on data from a survey of 233 seaweed farmers using non-probability snowball sampling. The collected data were analysed using partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) due to the complex nature of the research model. Key factors examined include cluster-based blue entrepreneurship, blue technology penetration, institutional assistance, mimetic pressure, and institutional voids. The findings indicate that cluster-based blue entrepreneurship positively influences export propensity. However, the study does not find substantial support for the relationship between cluster-based blue entrepreneurship and blue technology penetration. Notably, institutional assistance, mimetic pressure, and institutional voids play pivotal roles in moderating the impact of blue technology penetration on export propensity. Moreover, the study underscores the beneficial impact of blue technology penetration on export propensity and identifies institutional voids as critical moderators. It highlights the necessity for supportive institutional frameworks to foster cluster-based blue entrepreneurship and enhance export potential. These insights are crucial for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and practitioners aiming to formulate strategies for sustainable growth in Bangladesh's seaweed farming sector. It advocates for targeted policy interventions that strengthen institutional support, mitigate mimetic pressures, and address voids to enhance the industry's competitiveness and export potential. These insights offer practical implications for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and practitioners aiming to foster resilient and inclusive economic development in emerging marine resource sectors.

TI  - Design system and performance analysis of fish storage box by utilizing solar energy
AB  - Indonesia is a maritime country and many people work as traditional fishermen. Traditional fishermen generally use thermos filled with wet ice, ice boxes, or ice blocks to maintain the freshness of fish. The temperature obtained is still insufficient to maintain the fishâ€™s quality and freshness. Furthermore, some existing technologies are expensive and use fossil fuels. Researchers designed and manufactured a cool box that utilizes solar energy to store fish. The experimental research method was conducted by testing the performance of the cool box device at four different locations. The results showed that the solar panel produced an average of 2,527.2 W of energy in a day, which can power the cool box device for 10 hours. To maintain the fishâ€™s freshness with the reference temperature of 0-5 Â°C, the device uses temperature control to prevent the fish from freezing, which damages its structure. The temperature control also helps the tool save energy, allowing it to last 170 minutes longer than without using the temperature control feature.

TI  - Public perceptions on solar geoengineering from focus groups in 22 countries
AB  - Solar geoengineering maintains a vocal presence as a stop-gap measure in assessments of climate and sustainability action. In this paper, we map prospective benefits and risks, and corresponding governance approaches, regarding three major proposals for solar geoengineering (stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening, and a space-based sunshield). We do so by engaging with 44 focus groups conducted in 22 countries split between the global North and South. We compare results against previous research on the public perceptions of solar geoengineering as well as wider activities in assessment, innovation, and decision-making. We find that global South groups exhibit greater hope but an arguably richer range of concerns for solar geoengineering, in the context of observable inequities in climate action and potential geopolitical conflict. Meanwhile, a strong, global preference for multilateral coordination and public engagement from the conduct of research onwards is offset by skepticism of effective multilateralism and public discourse.

TI  - Comparison of 1 g and centrifuge modelling of drag anchors with subsurface wireless tracking
AB  - The kinematic behaviour of drag embedment anchors has become a recent research focus due to the increase in offshore renewable energy devices. This is due to their potential use as an anchoring system for future floating wind applications, in addition to the need to understand their penetration behaviour as a part of the Cable Burial Risk Assessment. Studies on the behaviour of anchors typically consist of field scale or model centrifuge tests, where such facilities are not readily available to all and can result in significant cost. In addition to this, measuring the load-penetration behaviour of an anchor has proven to be a significant challenge, as any contact-based methods are likely to influence the penetration behaviour of the anchor. In this paper, a novel wireless method of recording the inclination of the anchor and calculating the penetration depth is presented. A comparison of the penetration behaviour of a Class F (AC-14) anchor has been made in sand using centrifuge and 1g model scale testing. The results indicate that the 1g testing can match the behaviour of the anchor testing in the centrifuge in terms of both the position of the anchor and its orientation during the dragging event.

TI  - Design and optimization of semicircular offshore barrier with wave deflector
AB  - An offshore barrier is a structure constructed for the purpose of protecting the harbor area from the effects of waves and restraining sea erosion to an extend. offshore barrier provides habitat for marine life, protects ports, beaches and creates recreational opportunities such as snorkeling and diving, unlike other structures hemispherical offshore barrier can withstand large tides without being displaced by waves. To improve the performance of an existing semicircular barrier an deflector has been introduced. In the present study, the design of an perforated SBW(semi-circular breakwater) with deflector and its effects has been carried out, using Ansys fluent. A study on pressure, velocity and turbulence has been conducted. Fifth order stokes equation is used to simulate the short gravity waves with a height of 0.6m. The vertical and horizontal force acting on the offshore barrier for different deflector positions were evaluated. Four different hemispherical offshore barrier were designed using design modeler. A comparison and numerical flow visualization is made between perforated and various positions of deflector. For the force analysis, a comparison of both horizontal and vertical force graph is made and a better result on damped oscillation is obtained and it also provides the damping for the incoming wave energy. Thus the addition of deflector ensured a minimum energy accumulation in the downstream of the offshore barrier. Â© 2024 Author(s).

TI  - Development of a Marine Mooring Lines Image Dataset for Deep Learning Applications
AB  - Mooring systems, which use thin lines composed of fiber ropes, steel wires, and chains, are essential to offshore activities. These technologies play a critical role in ensuring that floating units stay in their proper positions throughout operations like offshore gas and oil drilling and production offloading into shuttle storage vessels. Early mooring line failure detection is critical to ensuring the safety and integrity of these activities since it helps avert unanticipated losses such as catastrophic catastrophes and human casualties. Recent developments in deep learning object detection have encouraged prospects for the creation of affordable mooring monitoring solutions. However, a specialized marine images dataset that includes mooring lines is required for the construction and testing of such models, and it is not publicly accessible at this time. Thus, this paper provides insights, design considerations, and general observations for the production of a high-quality marine mooring line images collection in response to the demand for one. Besides, a procedural framework has been designed for creating synthetic images consisting of mooring lines. Additionally, the real-time experimental process in the development of marine mooring lines images dataset for deep learning models that are intended to identify anomalies in mooring lines in offshore deep water has been demonstrated. The purpose of these guidelines is to improve the efficacy of deep learning solutions in determining the anomalies in mooring lines at an early stage by addressing the particular problems and peculiarities of the task.

TI  - Assessment of a Full-Electric Floating Liquefied Natural Gas Concept for Harsh Sea State Conditions at Remote Ultra-Deepwater Locations
AB  - This work describes an offshore gas monetization solution for harsh environmental conditions at ultra-deepwater and remote locations, as an alternative to conventional onshore plants associated with long subsea pipelines for Greenfield projects. Although gas-to-liquids and marine compressed natural gas are initially evaluated, associated gas is supposed to be exported from deepwater floating production storage and offloading units to a central floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility for additional treatment, fractionation, and liquefaction, producing liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for further tandem offloading. To demonstrate the technical feasibility of the proposed FLNG, its key technologies are reviewed, including liquefaction process selection, cargo containment system, station-keeping, offloading, and power generation. A full-electric FLNG is proposed, replacing conventional feed gas power generation systems with inner hull nuclear power modules, envisaging neutral CO2 emissions and earlier first LNG drop milestone achievement. The FLNG general arrangement is developed, along with its internal cargo tanks layout, for preliminary LNG and LPG production rundown and feed gas throughput. Numerical analyses are carried out to show that static and dynamic tilt criteria can be met, even for harsh sea states. Gas import riser configurations for the challenging ultra-deepwater location are outlined, after appropriate FLNG station-keeping analyses, in addition to a feasibility assessment of seawater intake risers, aiming for an overall gas plant efficiency increase.

AB  - Offshore engineering equipment manufacturing constitutes an important part of the strategic emerging industry and has great development potential. In order to promote the development of this industry, the development status and opportunities of China's offshore engineering equipment manufacturing industry were systematically reviewed. The development of China's offshore engineering equipment has made great progress in terms of revenue scale, independently controlled core technologies and equipment, industrial layout and structure adjustment, and position in international high-end markets. In the future, under the influence of intensified geopolitical competition, international oil price shocks and elevation, and green transformation of global energy, there will be strong demand for traditional oil and gas equipment and emerging engineering equipment such as offshore wind power, and offshore engineering equipment manufacturing enterprises are likely to benefit from the environment. Through comparative analysis between China's offshore engineering equipment manufacturing enterprises and world-renowned enterprises, it is found that the overall resilience and competitiveness of China's offshore engineering equipment manufacturing industry chain still need to be improved, and there are problems such as insufficient localization of core equipment and key components and inadequate linkage mechanism across the entire industry chain. It is suggested that China's offshore engineering enterprises should focus on strengthening technological innovation, industrial control, and safety support, and they are encouraged to work together to promote the integrated and specialized development of offshore engineering equipment, enhance the ability of independent incubation of high-end equipment, boost digital transformation and intelligent development, and accelerate the improvement of the linkage mechanism across the entire industry chain. In addition, they can continuously improve the core competitiveness and risk resistance of the industry chain, so as to promote the high-quality development of China' s offshore engineering equipment manufacturing industry.

TI  - Multi-dimensional resilience assessment framework of offshore structure under mooring failure
AB  - Resilience is an emerging concept in the management of engineering systems, and its application in enhancing the management of mooring systems is particularly valuable. To effectively manage resilience, it is crucial to assess the system's resilience level. This paper proposes a framework consisting of three key indexes: robustness resilience index (ROI), recovery resilience index (REI), and function performance index (FPI). These indexes assess system's technical, organizational, and economic capabilities, respectively. The ROI evaluates the failure process by employing failure modes analysis, while the REI quantifies the recovery process using a recovery model with various spare parts. The FPI introduces a probabilistic approach to measure the system's capacity over time, incorporating short-term and long-term repair actions. An illustrative example of a semisubmersible production system in the South China Sea is developed as a walk-through to validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed resilience framework, discussing quantitatively the effect of environment and available spares. Overall resilience is also obtained by radar graph. The findings indicate that the presence of one spare significantly enhances the system's resilience in industrial applications. Â© 2024

TI  - Investigation on Creep Life Prediction Model for the AeroâƒDerivative Gas Turbine
AB  - Because of its advantages of good development foundation, short design cycle, compact structure and strong fuel adaptability, the aero-derivative gas turbine has been widely used in the field of offshore oil and gas platform, marine power and pipeline transportation, etc. For the aero-derivative gas turbine blades working in high temperature, high pressure and other harsh environments, creep is one of the main failure modes. In order to ensure the operation reliability of the blade, nickel-based alloy with strong creep resistance is usually selected as its constitutive material. The nickel-based alloy has obvious third stage of creep, occupying a relatively high proportion of its whole life. The current creep damage constitutive model is difficult to accurately characterize the failure behavior of the third stage of creep for the nickel-based alloys. In response to the above problem, a creep damage constitutive model which can reasonably describe the third stage of creep of the high temperature materials is proposed in this paper. The model is validated by comparing with the creep experimental data under different temperatures. The proposed model can provide a theoretical guideline for accurate life prediction and reliability design of the high temperature components of aero-derivative gas turbines.

AB  - The submarine cable is an important component of offshore wind power system and the grounding circulation is a key factor to restrict the designing and operating of the submarine cable. Practical operating experiences show that there is a serious imbalance of the grounding currents in the onshore and offshore sections in the offshore wind field, but the cause of this mismatching is unknown, let alone a clear judgment on the operating state of the offshore cables with this phenomenon. In this paper, based on the actual structure of the submarine cable, we establish a distribution parameter model. For both the armor grounding and the armor/sheath grounding, the submarine cable grounding circulating currents are analyzed. The reason for the extremely mismatching grounding circulating current of the armor grounding cable is the existence of a short circuit resistance between the armor and the sheath of the offshore section; the reason for the extremely mismatching grounding circulating current of the armor/sheath grounding cable is the existence of a short circuit resistance between the armor and sheath or mismatched grounding resistance at both the ends of the cable. On this basis, an evaluation system of the submarine cable operating condition based on the circulation is proposed, which may provide a reference for the judgment of the actual submarine cable operating condition.

TI  - Hierarchical control of offshore oil and gas platform energy system considering the integration of offshore wind power
AB  - To support the integration of intermittent offshore wind power, a hierarchical control method based on the coordination of turbine generators and energy storage was developed for power grids of offshore oil and gas platforms. First, the multi-energy coupling characteristics and structures of offshore oil and gas platform energy systems were analyzed. Subsequently, a hierarchical control strategy was devised based on day-ahead scheduling and intraday horizon dispatch to smooth uncertainties at hourly level. Furthermore, a saturated filter-based power dispatch strategy was developed to coordinate turbine generators and energy storage to smooth the uncertainties at minute and second levels. Finally, the proposed strategy was tested using data from a real offshore oil and gas platform energy system. The results show that the proposed strategy can reduce the operating cost while supporting the integration of wind power. Â© 2024, State Power Economic Research Institute. All rights reserved.

TI  - Preliminary design of 5 GT fishing boat with electric motor propulsion for daily coast fisherman
AB  - Indonesia is an archipelagic country with a large number of daily coastal fishermen. The majority of fishing boats use diesel as fuel, on the other hand, solar energy as a renewable energy source is widely available in countries that cross the equator. This paper aims to conduct a preliminary design of a 5 GT fishing boat's use of solar panels as electric motor propulsion for daily coast fishermen. Based on field data processing, it was found that the appropriate fishing boat size was 10â€…m in length, 2.2â€…m in width, 1.1â€…m in height, and 0.55â€…m in the draft. The results of the design show that the electric motor propulsion fishing boat can operate optimally using solar energy is 7 hours with a sailing distance of 9 sea miles. These results can be used as a reference for the substitution of fossil fuels into renewable energy so that they can provide the benefits of low daily operating costs for daily coast fishermen.

TI  - LESSONS LEARNED FROM A 35KV SUBMARINE POWER CABLE REPLACEMENT
AB  - With todayâ€™s increased focus on reducing emissions, a significant amount of new and existing oil and gas companies around the world are working towards installing and/or replacing segregated generation centers by a centralized approach [12] [13] [14] and feeding the required facilities using a submarine power cable (SPC). Considering the current cost and lead time for these SPCs, it is important to have a good set of multidiscipline specifications, and standards to rule the technical design and testing of the SPCs, as well as having procedures in place to guide the selection, transportation, installation, and commissioning for these SPCs. Even though the industry comes with a significant set of standards to guide the SPC design, not all of them cover the full spectrum of requirements needed for this specialized design and installation. Therefore, complementing specifications with multiple standards is necessary. As the study case shows, over-specifying the technical aspect can confuse manufacturers and add unnecessary complexity to the SPC design. Additional consideration of the issues involved in transportation, testing and installation are required to avoid jeopardizing the final solution. This paper presents the lesson learns from one study case which covers an SPC replacement project from initial technical design through manufacturing, transportation, and installation. Â©2024 IEEE.

TI  - Power Supply for Submerged Camera as Applied to Environmental Monitoring
AB  - Underwater monitoring technology is crucial for studying aquatic life, particularly in mangrove ecosystems, which are vital to marine biodiversity. However, these environments present challenges such as limited power supply and frequent manual battery replacements. To address these issues, a renewable energy-powered supply system was developed for a submersible camera tailored for use in mangrove ecosystems. Various energy sources, including solar, wind, and wave energy, were evaluated, with the most suitable option selected based on energy availability and environmental compatibility. The waterproof prototype was designed for durability and ease of maintenance and tested initially in a controlled pool environment, followed by field deployment in the Lobo, Batangas mangrove area in the Philippines. Key performance aspects, including waterproofing, energy efficiency, and maintenance, were assessed. The system used a commercial utility box with silicone sealant to ensure waterproofing, and voltage and current measurements confirmed the reliable energy supply under varied load conditions. Results demonstrate the system's capability to meet continuous camera energy needs with minimal intervention, offering an effective solution for long-term underwater monitoring in mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Assisting Offshore Production Optimization Technology in Intelligent Completion Operation Based on Edge-Cloud Collaborative Technologies
AB  - This paper demonstrates the enhancement of intelligent completion capabilities by integrating with a digital oilfield platform for effective performance management of offshore wells. The development of intelligent completion technologies has been increasingly important in the field of oil exploration and production in the last few years. The development of an integrated system based on edge-cloud collaborative technologies is in line with the company's objectives of building offshore intelligent oilfields. This is the result of the integration of intelligent completion technology with digital advancements. The use of this technology addresses multi-well operations, reservoir complexity, formation pressure, production challenges, and substantial cost optimization in offshore environments. The integrated well-completion system comprises a cloud-based analytics management application, downhole sensors, downhole flow control tools, and on-site data gathering, analysis, and control devices. The main activities at the edge end are data processing and collection, which includes feature extraction, consistency validation, feature engineering, and data supplementation. Real-time data monitoring, analysis, and production optimization are carried out using constrained computational resources, with a focus on production activities, using simplified multi-field coupling analysis models; Obtaining drilling and completion data for various offshore oil and gas wells as well as reservoir analysis data from the production phase are the tasks involved at the cloud end. The system uses newly developed reservoir-wellbore multi-field coupling non-steady-state models for oil and gas well production analysis, combining real-time monitoring data from the offshore platform. It quickly offers medium-term and short-term production optimization solutions, with an emphasis on managing the production of oil and gas wells. The deployment of computational analysis models and the application of multi-well production optimization strategies are made possible by edge-cloud collaboration technology, which also maintains a reasonable degree of autonomy between on-site and remote management. These components are fully integrated and interact with each other to function as microservices, cloud-based container services, or edge computing services, providing a one-stop solution for improving reservoir management as it enables remote control and monitoring of downhole equipment.

TI  - Research on the Operation Reliability Evaluation Method of Offshore Power System
AB  - As an important power source of offshore oilfield platform, the stable operation state of offshore power system is a necessary condition for the safe production of offshore oilfield group. Considering the differences between offshore power system and terrestrial power system, the operation reliability evaluation system suitable for offshore power system is proposed in this paper. In addition, the equipment failure rate power flow distribution model and Marine cable failure model are more in line with the actual operation of oil field power system. The separate simulation method and the analytical method are not highly applicable to the offshore power system, so this paper combines the simulation method and the analytical method to evaluate the offshore power system. The above method is adopted to evaluate the operation reliability of more than 20 platforms of CNOOC, and put forward weak links and put forward constructive suggestions. Adding new energy and energy storage systems can improve the operation reliability of the power system to a certain extent.  Â© 2024 IEEE.

TI  - AN ESTIMATION OF THE HYDROELECTRIC POTENTIAL OF PUMPED HYDRO STORAGE SYSTEMS USING SEAWATER FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION IN A SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATE
AB  - Most of the Small Island Developing State (SIDS) nations are now focusing on variable renewable energy sources. However, these variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar are unpredictable and bring instabilities in the electric power system if not buffered by a reliable storage system. The proposed system will be a low head pumped hydro storage system using seawater as the medium. Given the fact that most SIDS are isolated and surrounded by large bodies of water, this paper will examine the potential use of the sea as a lower reservoir to generate sufficient energy from a relatively low head. This research will focus on detecting potential locations for the pumped hydro storage system sites on the island of Trinidad and Tobago (one of the SIDS nations) using the ArcGIS.Pro program. These sites were classified based on several criteria and the average potential power that can be generated was established. A total of 2001 potential sites were found that can sufficiently generate substantial energy for the island. Of these 2001 potential sites, 1127 were within the â€œFairâ€ classification, 725 were within the â€œGoodâ€ classification, 108 were within the â€œVery Goodâ€ classification and 41 were within the â€œExcellentâ€ classification. The estimated total energy that can be generated from the seawater pumped hydro storage system with the SIDS of Trinidad was found to be approximately 70.43 x 1014 J with a total estimated cumulative storage capacity of 4.81 x 109 m3.

TI  - Design of a Solar PV Powered Cold Storage for Fish in Sena and Mrongo Beaches in Mfangano Island, Kenya
AB  - Fishing is a popular economic activity in Kenya's lakeside region. Its long-term viability and profitability is dependent on reliable supply of power and a refrigeration system. The lack of electricity at the study locations of Mrongo and Sena Beaches necessitates purchase of ice from transport trucks, which is then placed in locally made cooler boxes containing fish. Ice is replaced every three to four days, if not available might cause fish to spoil thus sold quickly fetching low prices. The size of the cold storage facility in this study was based on the mass of fish caught each day and the amount of ice required for storage. Product and transmission loads were used in designing the refrigeration system. The solar photovoltaic capacity was designed to generate an equivalent electrical energy to the calculated thermal energy with two-day autonomy. Finally, the system's economic viability was assessed. The results of the design revealed that Mrongo Beach, required two 1 kW refrigeration systems powered by 1.5 kW of solar PV. The Simple Payback Period (SPP) and Net Present Value (NPV) were 2.2 years and USD 6,787.10 respectively. Sena Beach required three 1 kW refrigeration systems and 2.8 kW of solar PV with its SPP and NPV 2.9 years and USD 3,153.61 respectively. Â© 2024 IEEE.

TI  - Chasing Currents: Onboard Depth Optimization for AUV Energy Savings
AB  - We present the development and testing of an onboard behavior designed to achieve energy efficient transits by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The behavior allows an AUV to measure a profile of ocean currents on its descent and choose a depth in real-time that minimizes its energy consumption per unit distance. The behavior is implemented onboard a REMUS 100 AUV using a back-seat driver and the Robot Operating System (ROS). Two new behavior specific processes are defined and integrated on top of a previously developed ROS/REMUS architecture. Finally we present results from a proof of concept field experiment conducted off the coast of San Diego, CA. The AUV demonstrates successful depth-seeking and saves energy by intelligent navigation of ocean currents with a strong vertical gradient.  Â© 2024 IEEE.

TI  - Optimizing Renewable Energy Resources on an Isolated Island to Support an Archipelagic Country's Net Zero Emission Target: A Case Study of Sumba Island, Indonesia
AB  - Sumba Island, rich in solar and wind potential, faces challenges in developing RES due to isolated grids and low electricity demand. U sing renewable energy in Sumba is necessary to support Indonesia's NZE goals by effectively integrating Sumba's renew abIes into the national grid and potentially connecting it to regions with high electricity demand. This study focuses on the sustainable GEP for Sumba, optimizing renewable energy potential, improving energy storage, and exploring inter-island connectivity through MILP to achieve the optimal value of the total system cost and the least investment with predetermined boundaries. Several scenarios were examined, and the results show that connecting Sumba to nearby islands with higher electricity demands would increase the use of local RES. With the NZE interconnected scenario, the solar PV potential can be maximized up to 76.8%, while the wind share can reach 58.4%. However, in the other scenarios, the potential use of solar PV and wind remains below 6%. Energy storage will become more necessary as solar PV and wind power use rises, increasing the proportion of renewable energy in 2060. Moreover, interconnection reduces the cost of electricity compared to an isolated system, but it can increase investment costs. Â© 2024 IEEE.

TI  - NUMERICAL HYDRODYNAMIC INVESTIGATIONS OF A MULTI-PILE-SUPPORTED AQUACULTURAL STRUCTURE
AB  - With the continuous consumption of natural resources in the ocean, aquaculture has become a new focus in various countries and fish farming structures have developed rapidly in last decades in both nearshore and offshore regions. However, the hydrodynamic characteristics of structures which integrated aquacultural nets and other marine structures together remain unclear. Monopile-based structures are common types of fixed-bottom structures at offshore sea areas with shallow water depths where are rich in wind energy, oil and fishery resources. In order to improve the utilization efficiency of offshore structures, a multi-pile-supported aquacultural structure is proposed in the study which consists of net panels and monopiles. In this paper, a new coupling method which combined discrete-module-beam (DMB) method and lumped mass method with Screen model is proposed to obtain the hydrodynamic responses of monopiles and nets in the integrated aquacultural structure. A series of numerical calculations are carried out to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of pile-net structures under different regular wave conditions. The influence of net panels on the hydrodynamic characteristics of monopiles are measured and discussed. It is found that the influence of net panels on the hydrodynamic characteristics of current model is negligible. Overall, the results of this study can be used as a basis for future design and optimization of similar integrated marine structures. Â© 2024 by ASME.

TI  - Research progress on topology and energy management of fuel cell hybrid power ships
AB  - With the increasing awareness of environmental protection, the maritime industry is moving towards green and low-carbon development. Fuel cells, due to their pollution-free and high-efficiency characteristics, are one of the key technologies driving the green transformation of traditional ships. However, fuel cells have relatively soft output characteristics and often require other energy storage components to provide supplementary power. This paper reviews the types, advantages, and disadvantages of the topologies of fuel cell hybrid power ships, analyses the current development status of energy management goals and methods, and finally provides an outlook on the development of fuel cell hybrid power ships.

TI  - Application of Hydropower Energy in Hydrogen Production: Tide, Wave, Water Flow, and Fall
AB  - In recent years, utilizing renewable energy sources has received great attention and combining hydropower technology with hydrogen production has emerged as a promising approach to producing and storing clean energy that may be able to address some of the issues related to the intermittent and variable nature of renewable energy sources. Due to the fact that hydrogen is used in numerous industries, including the production of fertilizer, petroleum refining, ammonia and methanol production, fuel cells, and others, the global market for hydrogen production is expanding significantly every year. Renewable energy sources are becoming more important due to the decrease in availability of nonrenewable energy sources, increased costs, and environmental constraints. With the world moving toward a low-carbon economy, the ability of hydropower, a renewable energy source that has been used for centuries to produce electricity, to also produce hydrogen is becoming more and more crucial and helping to develop more effective hydrogen energy technologies. This chapter aims to present a general overview of the use of hydropower energy (tide, wave, water flow, and fall) in the production of hydrogen.

TI  - RETROFITTING PROPELLER PROCEDURE FOR A HYDROGEN FUELED OFFSHORE SUPPORT VESSEL
AB  - With new technologies bringing drastic changes to ship design, existing vessels are facing challenges to accommodate the revolutionary changes for a cleaner future. This paper presents the retrofitting study applied to the propulsion system of an offshore support vessel to be fueled by hydrogen, which shows suitability to operate coastal vessels. Redesign of the vesselâ€™s propulsion system has been conducted. First, the ship resistance is computed using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The results show a good agreement with the data exported from the experimental tests and the computed results from empirical formulas. Then, based on the resistance calculation, the propeller is redesigned to improve its performance without any modifications in the main prime mover and the gearbox. The results show a significant improvement in the propeller performance as well as ship operating conditions compared to the existing propeller. The findings of this study contribute to the ongoing TransShip II project, which is applied to the Prince Madog research vessel to achieve zero emission levels in the maritime industry. This kind of retrofitting procedure will promote energy-efficient designs in further ships to reduce the amount of fuel consumption and exhaust emissions compared to the performance of the existing vessels.

TI  - 100+ Deepwater MPD Wells Learnings
AB  - MPD offshore in deepwater is less than 20 years old. Over the last decade there was noticeable evolution of usage of MPD technology. The industry acceptance of what is considered the correct application of the technology has evolved over the years. The first barrier concept and well control practices now consider the capability and characteristics of MPD technology. This allowed the undrillable wells to be drilled with almost no penalty when compared to a conventional well intervention. The operational awareness improved, due to new capabilities of MPD techniques, leading to an improvement on the overall efficiency of the intervention. The sustained use with better understanding of the benefits of the technology lead to more refined applications of MPD, while reducing the added operational time. New applications also were developed using existing equipment, widening the deployment extent of MPD during well construction and maintenance. Still, major discussions are needed to further develop the technology on deepwater scenarios. Completion and workover are still not discussed in depth in the industry and operational concepts between different disciplines must align considering MPD advantages and limitations. This paper presents key aspects of the evolution of MPD application based on the experience of drilling more than 100 wells using MPD on deepwater scenarios. Regarding the MPD evolution, a revision of the internal and external operations, through several papers and publications allows the identification of different factors that changed over the years.

TI  - Energy transition league: A comparison of islandsâ€™ paths to net zero emissions
AB  - In line with national commitments on net zero emissions, many island jurisdictions demonstrate significant progress in decarbonising power production. We use empirical evidence to show what already has worked on a selection of islands, proving that the advantages of the energy transition outweigh the perceived risks. Wind power and, to a lesser extent, solar PV are allowing islands to become self-sufficient in generating affordable electricity from renewable sources. On volcanic islands, geothermal energy is also successfully utilised. There are currently no plans for nuclear power plants or electrolysers for green hydrogen whilst tidal and wave energy barely feature. One obvious shortfall in future systems appears to be an inadequate amount of grid-scale energy storage. Significant storage capacity will be needed to match variable supply to fluctuating demand and to provide ancillary services, both on islands that are interconnected (for resilience against subsea cable faults) and those that are not (assuming fossil fuels are to be completely phased out). There are as yet only limited plans to strengthen distribution networks for wholesale electrification, whilst more effort is needed to get the public fully behind societal changes. Nonetheless, it is clear that the first movers have benefitted economically and their continuing success will help demonstrate to others the value in moving rapidly away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

TI  - Ocean Energy-A Myriad of Opportunities in the Renewable Energy Sector
AB  - Oceans constitute 70.8% of the Earthâ€™s surface and accounts for approximately 97% of the water on Earth. Massive depletion of fossil fuels has been a cause of concern in the world scenario primarily due to its depletion and because of its effects on the environment. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reports, the carbon dioxide level from its Mauna Loa Atmospheric Baseline Observatory is 421 ppm, which is in stark comparison to the level of 220 ppm measured during the start of the Industrial Revolution. The widespread oceanic region on earth is an enormous source of renewable energy and has diverse forms of low-carbon technologies, which will enable nations a faster and reliable transition to greener energy. These transitions will enable coastal countries and island nations to achieve lesser greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A comprehensive study involving life cycle assessment of the technology, environmental impacts, and sustenance of the project toward future proofing will enable better promotion of ocean energy resources. Europe leads the worldâ€™s nations in design and in research and development of ocean energy projects. The European Commission has allocated 47% and 25% of funds toward the development of wave and tidal energy projects and 17% toward environmental research. It is imperative that nations should come together toward the promotion of ocean energy and its importance in future. Â© 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

TI  - Offshore Platform Revamp for Energy Transition Projects: An Integrated Monitoring System for Real-Time Asset Integrity Control and Operative Life Extension Certification
AB  - An integrated structural monitoring system (ISMS) for offshore platforms composed of different monitoring networks working simultaneously is presented in this contribution. The sensor networks of the proposed solution allow for covering both global and local key monitoring tasks, and a comprehensive knowledge of structural situation is ensured. It is possible to get precise information on environmental excitations and to measure their effect on the structure. Moreover, a thorough alarm service allows for efficient notification of possible critical situations both in real time and in the long term. Main outcomes obtained from first monitoring experiences on offshore platforms performed over more than five years are presented and explained in detail. The outcomes of the ISMS may represent a valuable input for a wide range of strategic tasks, such as asset integrity control, model update, digital twin. Different key activities related to the asset management can take advantage from the installation of the ISMS, especially in case of aged structures, such as life extension certification, relaxation of periodicity of inspections, energy transition projects.
