TI  - Importance of within-shoot epiphyte distribution for the carbon budget of seagrasses: the example of Posidonia oceanica
AB  - To assess the effects of shading by epiphytes on the carbon balance of the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, we examined the patterns of withinshoot epiphyte abundance on leaves, and their variability with season and depth. Epiphyte biomass was found to depend on leaf age (larger epiphyte load on older tissues), leaf side (more epiphytes on the inner face than on the outer) and depth (more epiphytes in deep meadows). Depth differences were maximum in spring and disappeared in late summer. Percent light absorbed (absorptance) by epiphytes was measured; light absorptance followed an exponential saturated model with epiphyte biomass. Combining these data of percent light absorbed, withinshoot epiphyte biomass distribution and an existing carbon balance model, we conclude that reduction in carbon gains caused by epiphyte shading is relatively small, and greater in deep meadows (8.8\% on average, with values up to 14.2\% in May) than that in shallow water (4.7\% on average with maximum values of 7\% in August). This is mainly due to the accumulation of epiphytes on old tissues, which contribute only marginally to the carbon gain of the plant. Using the same procedure, we modelled the effects of a doubling in epiphyte biomass, conserving the observed withinshoot distribution. The result was a very small additional carbon loss. However, using the same biomass but modifying the distribution (shifting the same abundance towards younger leaf age classes), the reduction in carbon gains was dramatic, particularly in deep meadows (between 21\% and 41\%, depending on the shift used). Therefore, it is the epiphyte growth timing rate rather than the final biomass reached which seems to be a key control for Posidonia oceanica survival, especially near the deep limit of its distribution.

TI  - Groundwater research in mangrove coastal ecosystems-new prospects
AB  - Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and/or porewater exchange is a major pathway of inorganic and organic carbon fluxes in coastal mangrove ecosystems. We provide a comprehensive overview of groundwater research in mangrove ecosystems by 1) briefly describing â€œwhat is SGD?"; 2) by explaining and highlighting the importance of tidal exchange of groundwater and/or porewater with surface water in mangrove forests and other adjacent coastal systems; and 3) by discussing the impacts of mangrove deforestation and the land conversion from mangroves to aquaculture ponds and urban settlements on the local coastal hydrogeology (groundwater hydrology). We then summarize currently available methods that have been successfully used to measure groundwater in scientific studies-with a focus on natural groundwater tracers (radon and temperature) and remote sensing technology (e.g., aerial thermal infrared imagery (ATI)). Furthermore, we provide suggestions for future larger-scale and efficient monitoring options in the context of changing hydrogeological conditions in mangrove ecosystems, based on the thermal anomalies of SGD and other coastal hydrological processes.

TI  - Elucidating the microbial communities and anaerobic mechanisms of a new biomass capable of capturing carbon and sulfur pollutants for sulfate-laden wastewater treatment
AB  - The municipal wastewater of coastal cities contains not only chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) pollutants but also a significant concentration of sulfate (about 30-100 mg S-SO4/L). This emerging sulfate-laden wastewater, possibly resulting from the disposal of industrial waste or the seawater intrusion in the municipal wastewater, poses noteworthy operational problems like odor emissions, localized pipe corrosion, and inhibition of conventional biological treatment. To resolve these problems, we have recently developed a new sulfur-cycle enhanced biological phosphorus removal (SC-EBPR) process capable of removing COD, N, and P and controlling sulfide production. This study investigates the possibility of cultivating SC-EBPR biomass under various influent COD and sulfate concentrations (with initial organic carbon (C) to sulfur (S) ratios of 1, 2, and 3 g C/g S), which dominanted by sulfate-reducing bacteria, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and unknown bacteria. Moreover, anaerobic batch experiments were conducted for (i) elucidating the fundamental mechanisms of carbon uptake/poly-hydroxyalkanoates formation (1.8-3.8 mg C/(gVSS h)), sulfate reduction/sulfur storage (0.9-1.9 mg S/(gVSS h)), and poly-phosphate degradation/P release (0.6-3.0 mg P/(gVSS h)), and (ii) understanding a new anaerobic pathway of simultaneous intracellular uptake of carbon and sulfur (as verified by carbon balance with only 5-10% error). Finally, a possible way of implementing the new SC-EBPR biomass in high-sulfate wastewater treatment was discussed. Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - An economic basis for littoral land-based production of low carbon fuel from nuclear electricity and seawater for naval or commercial use
AB  - Three separate U.S. military databases were used to estimate the U.S. Navy operational fuel needs at sea for the last several years. Defense Science Board data were used to estimate the current FY2013 total fuel delivered-at-sea price being paid by the USN per gallon between $6 and $7. Using published capital cost data and a range of nuclear electrical energy scenarios, costs ranging between $1.48 to $8.67 per gallon are estimated for producing 82,000. gal per day of fuel in littoral land-based locations. This provides policy analysts with a reasonable economic rationale and justification for planning and designing a new littoral land-based energy conversion process to provide low carbon jet and diesel fuel for operations at sea. This process is considered low carbon emissions because it uses environmentally available carbon and hydrogen and dedicated nuclear electrical energy as its only inputs. Generic naval missions and fuel usage data provide the constraints needed for establishing full scale process size, number of locations, power requirements, and cost using current light water nuclear reactor technology. This information may also be used by policy analysts to support changes in future naval energy policy. Â© 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Realizing zero discharge riserless drilling and annular pressure management with a single tool
AB  - Zero discharge drilling has been one of the â€œholy grailsâ€ of the industry since offshore drilling commenced. Millions of dollars are spent to drill the upper portions of wells through an operation that is well known as â€œpump and dumpâ€ in the drilling parlance. This practice has continued unabated for lack of a suitable and cost effective method for recovering the mud while drilling this interval. An alternative to â€œpump and dumpâ€ provides savings not only in the cost of the mud, but also alleviates any environmental impact concerns. Also, current practice provides limited direct pressure management during the drilling of upper sections of the hole, allowing everything from borehole washouts, shallow water flows to loss of the wellbore itself to occur. Now is a good time for the industry to look at the new options available to achieve zero discharge drilling. This paper presents a methodology for achieving both elimination of â€œpump and dumpâ€ and borehole pressure management using a single tool. The paper discusses a unique subsea pumping apparatus that could be deployed at the sea floor to divert and pump back return drilling fluid through a separate conduit, as well as having the capability to apply a back pressure to the well and thus manage the pressure in the annulus during the drilling of the upper hole sections. Advantages include full returns of the mud during the drilling of the upper hole sections, opportunities to use specialty muds for the health of the borehole, and pressure management for mitigating shallow water incidents. The potential effect is a smoother drilling operation creating options to drill to deeper depths and set the conductor casing deeper. The paper will highlight the processes of pressure management, the tools and methods to deploy the technology as well as touch upon the costs involved. The paper will also explore options to deploy this technology from a purpose built rig specially for drilling the top holes with zero discharge and annular pressure management.

TI  - Future challenges for deepwater developments
AB  - Discoveries over the past 20 years have established the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico (DW GoM) as a major hydrocarbon-producing region. The recent discoveries in Mississippi Canyon and Green Canyon areas, together with the emerging lower tertiary play in the Walker Ridge and Keathly Canyon areas signal a strong shift in field development challenges for the DW GoM. These challenges span a number of disciplines and include greatly increased drilling depths in remote areas with much higher reservoir pressures and lower permeability hydrocarbon reservoirs. Industry advances are needed in numerous technologies such as subsalt imaging, novel completion and casing designs, subsea production equipment rated in excess of 15,000 psi, subsea High Integrity Pressure Protection Systems (HIPPS), and subsea processing. This paper provides BP's view of some of the key challenges the industry is facing, and the technologies that will be required to successfully develop the next generation of deepwater oil and gas fields in the GoM with a particular focus on those required for the lower tertiary trend. The solutions to these challenges will require cooperation among the operators, the engineering contractors and equipment suppliers working with the regulatory authorities to pave the way for the safe and reliable development of these future fields.

TI  - FRENCH DRILL IN 5,624-ft WATERS.
AB  - Total exploration and partners have successfully drilled an exploratory well in 5,624 ft (1,714 m) of water in the Mediterranean Sea, a new water depth record for the petroleum industry. The project, initiated in 1979, was designed to perfect subsea drilling equipment and techniques that may be applied in water depths to nearly 10,000 ft (3,000 m). Using Sonat Offshore Drilling Inc. 's dynamically positioned drillship Discoverer Seven Seas and a unique riser built particularly for the deepwater effort, well GLP 1 was spudded November 9, 1982, and completed on January 5, 1983. A total 6,165 ft (1,879 m) of hole was drilled below the sea floor, and three strings of casing were run and cemented successfully. Geologic objectives of the well were attained, and both existing and new offshore equipment and technology utilized presented few operating problems.

TI  - CO2 fluxes across the air-sea interface in the southeastern Beaufort Sea: Ice-free period
AB  - Surface mixed layer CO2 fugacities (fCO2-sw) calculated from carbonate system parameters in the southeastern Beaufort Sea during the ice-free period ranged from 240 to 350 Î¼atm in fall 2003 and from 175 to 515 Î¼atm in summer 2004. The surface mixed layer remains mostly undersaturated with respect to atmospheric CO2 (378 Î¼atm) and, therefore, acts as a potential CO2 sink throughout this period. Air-sea CO2 fluxes (FCO2) were first computed assuming ice-free conditions and ranged from -32.4 to +8.6 mmol m-2 d -1 in fall 2003 and summer 2004, respectively. Then we included a reduction factor to account for ice cover (ic) and we computed the resulting fluxes (FCO2-ic). In fall 2003, FCO2-ic ranged from -4.7 mmol m-2 d-1 in the relatively open water of the Cape Bathurst Polynya to -0.1 mmol m-2 d-1 in the southeastern Beaufort Sea, limited by the presence of the multiyear sea ice. In summer 2004, FCO2-ic ranged from -13.1 mmol m-2 d-1 on the western Mackenzie Shelf to +8.6 mmol m-2 d-1 at Cape Bathurst; the variability being ascribed to competing effects of vertical mixing, temperature variations, and possibly biological production. On average, a net sink of -2.3 Â± 3.5 mmol m-2 d-1 was estimated for the ice-free period over the study area. Nevertheless, the FCO2 displays strong variability due to ice coverage, freshwater input, and upwelling events. The potential responses (direction and intensity of potential feedbacks) of the carbon cycle in the study area to a changing Arctic climate are discussed. Â© 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.

AB  - The recovery of carbon dioxide from concentrated sources is currently under evaluation as a technology for the control of the emission into the atmosphere. In order this option would be operative it is necessary to define the fate of recovered carbon dioxide. Two ways are open forward: disposal in natural fields (oceans, aquifers, deep geological cavities); utilisation (technological use or chemical conversion). The fixation in chemicals can contribute both to reduce the use of fossil carbon and to cut the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

TI  - Risks to global biodiversity from fossil-fuel production exceed those from biofuel production
AB  - Potential global biodiversity impacts from near-term gasoline production are compared to biofuel, a renewable liquid transportation fuel expected to substitute for gasoline in the near term (i.e., from now until c. 2030). Petroleum exploration activities are projected to extend across more than 5.8 billion ha of land and ocean worldwide (of which 3.1 billion is on land), much of which is in remote, fragile terrestrial ecosystems or off-shore oil fields that would remain relatively undisturbed if not for interest in fossil fuel production. Future biomass production for biofuels is projected to fall within 2.0 billion ha of land, most of which is located in areas already impacted by human activities. A comparison of likely fuel-source areas to the geospatial distribution of species reveals that both energy sources overlap with areas with high species richness and large numbers of threatened species. At the global scale, future petroleum production areas intersect more than double the area and a higher total number of threatened species than future biofuel production. Energy options should be developed to optimize provisioning of ecosystem services while minimizing negative effects, which requires information about potential impacts on critical resources. Energy conservation and identifying and effectively protecting habitats with high-conservation value are critical first steps toward protecting biodiversity under any fuel production scenario.

TI  - CHEMISTRY OF THE MOLTEN CARBONATE PROCESS FOR SULFUR OXIDES REMOVAL FROM STACK GASES.
AB  - In the molten carbonate process a molten eutectic mixture of lithium, sodium, and potassium carbonates removes sulfur oxides from power plant stack gases. The resulting molten solution of alkali metal sulfites, sulfates, and unreacted carbonate is regenerated in a two-step process to the alkali carbonate for recycling. Hydrogen sulfide, which is evolved in the regeneration step, is converted to sulfur in a conventional Claus plant. A 10 MW pilot plant of the process has been constructed at the Consolidated Edison Arthur Kill Station on Staten Island.

TI  - Three-year rice grain yield responses to coastal mudflat soil properties amended with straw biochar
AB  - Biochar application is a promising management strategy for enhancing soil fertility and carbon sequestration. A 3-year pot trial was conducted to demonstrate the relationship between rice grain yield and biochar-amended soil properties together with carbon storage in the Yangtze River estuary, China. Straw biochar was incorporated once into soil in pots at five different rates: 0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 15\%, and 20\% (dry biochar weight/wet soil weight). Compared to yields from the control treatment with no biochar, rice grain yield was improved by 29.1-34.2\% in the treatments with 10-15\% biochar in the first year following biochar application. In the second year following biochar application, the rice yield was increased by 51.8-96.0\% in the treatments with 15-20\% biochar. However, compared to the control treatment, hardly any yield increase occurred in any of the biochar treatments in the third year following biochar application. Higher amounts of added biochar increased the soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN). SOC contents were invariable and increased nearly 60-250\% annually in the biochar treatments compared with the control. Biochar increased soil TN 22.9-75.3\%, 24.0-60.9\% and 13.8-51.2\%, respectively, in each of three consecutive years. Biochar increased the mean concentrations of EC, RAP, RAK and DOC by 8.8-44.8\%, 10.0-61.1\%, 65.6-310.1\% and 9.1-20.0\%, respectively, during the three rice-growing seasons. The addition of 10-15\% straw biochar to soil and regular annual biochar supplements for agronomic purposes is a potentially sustainable management technology to enhance coastal mudflat soil properties and improve rice yields therefrom.

The most advanced, sophisticated and expensive technology is used in offshore operations as each step in the evolution of the welding systems required an increasing precision in the bevel preparation in order to provide valid results. The pipe-facing machines, working around the clock, have to ensure the bevel precision according to the strict technical specifications. Moreover, the pipe-facing machine must guarantee the required tolerances over time, maintaining the same tool adjustment and avoiding any inaccuracies, upsettings, wavings or other working defects.

TI  - What are the potential paths for carbon capture and storage in Sweden? A multi-level assessment of historical and current developments
AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS), including bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), could contribute to climate change mitigation strategies. However, the 2020s is not the first time that CCS is high on the agenda. This study explores the differences between the past and current developments of CCS and discusses how incumbent actors' experiences can inform the understanding of potential future energy system transitions in Sweden. For this purpose, a multi-level perspective (MLP) analysis was conducted based on documents, interviews and focus groups with key actors. Since the 2000s, increased urgency of climate change has further pushed policy makers into action. In addition, there is a new framing of CCS that underscores the potential of BECCS to provide negative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as well as prospects for offshore storage of CO2 in Norway and other territories. As such, this study shows that Sweden could be on a transformation pathway towards implementing CCS alongside other mitigation measures.

TI  - Critical offshore field development projects-why work outside of strict timelines?
AB  - Overcoming environmental challenges to develop offshore oil fields remains daunting for engineers who must balance economic feasibility with environmental protection, often within limited timelines before first oil commitments. A critical examination of Saudi Arabia's field development cases reveals a 56-year timeline (which seems interminable) between offshore field discovery in 1957 and realization of an environmentally friendly field development in 2013. If teams desire to accomplish Aegian projects with the sustenance of core values in perspective (whatever the core values might be), such as to gain the economic advantages of offshore projects while preserving the environment or honoring some other constraint, it is imperative to work with more robust timelines. Whereas strictly time-bounding projects may help with releasing adrenalin for performance, engineers may require adequate time for innovative concept designs to conduct necessary pilots and qualification. Collaboration between cross-functional project teams-construction, drilling, testing, and production-is examined from the economic delivery of several challenging wells under various environmental challenges and constraints. An overarching theme from each team was to apply environmental solutions. Colonization of hard coral species and presence of several fish species were observed on project completion. For example, a 70% increase in growth of Seagrass and artificial coral reefs was observed near the causeway built for the Manifa Field, which could become a hot spot of biodiversity. Water circulation, as measured by an acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) improved from 17 days before the project to 11 days on project completion. When engineers persevere, collaborate and have enough time to plan intensively until they find the technology solutions to advance, society benefits from an environmental return. As the worldwide study cases reveal, several projects are threatened globally because engineers may be unable to find viable solutions under rigid timelines. Often companies must be willing to wait until they acquire the technologies to responsibly advance complex environmentally sensitive projects. If timelines are flexible and sufficiently realistic, management's unwavering support to avail necessary resources would be critical for success. Â© 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Full-scale verification of the hydrodynamic motions of a floating facility
AB  - Quantifying the hydrodynamic motions of a floating facility is critical for ensuring its safe and efficient operation. The ability to obtain estimates of the motion response charactersitics using a numerical approach to estimate the seastate is particulary attractive for sites in which limited observational wave data are available. Validation of such a numerial approach using full-scale data is however, desirable in order to establish its accuracy and limitations. To this end, this paper presents a case study where numerical estimates of the dynamic motions of a drillship were validated using high quality dynamic motion records acquired during the drilling campaign. The model comprises a hindcast of the directional wave spectra and numerically derived hydrodynamic response characteristics of the ship. The performance of the model is evaluated using a range of selected seastates which were observed during the drilling campaign. It is demonstrated that reliable estimates of the motions of most interest for a drilling operation can generally be obtained, thus providing support to the use of the provided numerical approach for conducting operability assessments for floating facility planning purposes.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration a Viable Option to Mitigate Climate Change
AB  - Anthropogenic activity mainly burning of fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil is one of the major reasons which increase concentration of earth-warming gases. Chief among these gases is carbon dioxide. As per the data in last 250 years, CO2 level increases from 250 to more than 280 parts per million (PPM). Major consequences of this rise in CO2 level involve disturbance in climatic factors such as sea level rise; floods; droughts; changes in the amount, timing and distribution of rain; increased frequency and intensity of wildfires and disturbance of coastal marine and other ecosystems. That is why control over CO2 production and reducing CO2 level become important. One of the natural ways to CO2 control involves CO2 sequestration which involves removal of CO2 from atmosphere or storage of CO2 from emission sources to vegetation, soil and sediments. Biological carbon sequestration has opened up a new area of research towards enhancing rapid fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide in present level to reduce and mitigate global warming and climate change. This chapter describes various sources of carbon dioxide with relation to increasing greenhouse gases. It also includes scientific basis for current understanding of climate change and the role of biological carbon sequestration like soil, grassland, peatland and forests for mitigating the increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration.

TI  - Assessing energy business cases implemented in the North Sea Region and strategy recommendations
AB  - e-harbours is a unique European project that was set out to identify viable energy business cases on the exploitation of energy flexibility, which optimise their operations to match energy demand and supply while taking account of the additional volatility in supply caused by renewable energy sources, improve energy efficiency, and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. In this paper, we propose an integrated multi criteria decision analysis based framework to assess the relative performance of 21 energy business cases, which implemented different demand-side management strategies. Our proposed methodology has the ability to address complex problems involving multiple conflicting interests from various stakeholders, different forms of data, and different fuzzy and crisp relations. We find that business cases based on contract optimisation and offering reserve capacity were ranked relatively high, while those based on trading on the wholesale market or hybrid approaches fared less well. Despite finding viable pilot business cases, e-harbours found that there was little enthusiasm among industrial partners to scale up the pilots. Consequently, EU governments should consider offering attractive incentive programmes for industry engagement in achieving their objectives in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy supply security, diversifying energy supplies, and improving Europe's industrial competitiveness.

TI  - Energy savings by optimization of thrusters allocation during complex ship manoeuvres
AB  - The International Maritime Organization adopted a strategy to reduce the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050, compared to 2008 levels. The European Union proposed an even farther reaching transformation: the European Commission adopted a set of proposals to make the EUâ€™s transport policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Therefore, all industrial actions in line and consistent with these strategies are essential. One of such activities may be a gradual transition from the most common independent controls of transport shipsâ€™ thrusters, propellers, and rudders to an integrated, power optimized, 3 degrees of freedom joystick control. In this paper, the full mission bridge simulator (FMBS) research on potential energy savings and, consequently, a GHG emission reduction, while steering a RoPax twin-screw ferry equipped with bow thrusters by a joystick control, is presented. The task of navigators engaged in the research was to steer the vessel either via classic engine, rudder, and thruster levers or via a joystick while (1) following the predefined straight track, (2) rotating at the turning area, and (3), finally, crabbing (moving sideways) until stopping at the quay fenders. The conclusions are that energy savings of approximately 10% can be expected for berthing manoeuvres controlled by a joystick, compared to independent actuatorsâ€™ controls. These conclusions have been drawn from a statistical analysis of the shipâ€™s energy consumption during typical manoeuvring phases of 18 berthing operations performed in FMBS. Â© 2021 by the authors.

TI  - The economic case for floating production facilities
AB  - Floating production systems have been used for some twenty years, longer if jack-up based systems are included. For most of that time, they have been considered as a "special case" outside the mainstream of offshore oil production. Their use is now increasing rapidly - not only in their long-term strongholds of the UK North Sea and of Brazil's Campos Basin but in many other theatres of offshore operations. The growth seems so fast that it has been predicted that the number in service will double in the remaining years of this century. Technological progress has played a major part in the greater acceptance of floating production systems but there have also been powerful economic forces at work. This paper seeks to explain the reasons for the increase in popularity which promises to bring floating production within the main stream of offshore development.

TI  - Designing for wave impact on bow and deck structures
AB  - The development of a new design tool for prediction of loads and responses due to impact from steep waves on ships and platforms is described. The need for this has been growing as result of the number of incidents with damage on bow and deck structures being reported from offshore floating production systems. Fully nonlinear analyses of the problem are very complex, and are still research tools. For engineering applications simplified procedures are chosen. One such approach, based on a combination of presently available theory, is discussed. The aim is to end up with a practical and robust tool taking into account the most essential linear and nonlinear physical effects. The main physical mechanisms considered important for the prediction of events with serious damages are considered. This includes such as non-linear effects in steep and energetic random waves combined with wave diffraction and vessel motion, non-linear water propagation on deck with resulting impact load pressure distributions, and finally, the structural integrity assessment. The design analysis also includes a statistical prediction of impact events. Empirical calibration against model tests in regular and irregular waves is essential.

TI  - Comparison between quasi-static analysis and dynamic simulation for the motions and mooring tensions of floating offshore platforms
AB  - As the development of offshore oil well advances to deep sea, the platform/mooring lines coupled analysis in time-domain is required in estimating the design tension to consider the complex nonlinear effects in the dynamic responses of floating offshore structures. However, in the early design stage where a number of environmental conditions are dealt with, a simpler analysis method adopting the uncoupled and quasi-static analysis is still practical. In this study, the uncoupled, quasi-static analysis in frequency-domain and the coupled analysis in time-domain were compared to establish a basis of design analysis flow from former to latter. A semi-submersible platform was selected as a comparison model, and a reasonable agreement between the two analysis methods were identified. Â© 2016, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - First Australasian batch conductor drilling - World record size - Ahead of time estimate
AB  - Since the turn of the millennium, non-retrievable drilling with casing technology has been introduced to the Asia Pacific region. Soft formations encountered in offshore drilling environments have promoted the successful application of casing drilling technology for conductor and surface casing installation1,2,3. The Weatherford system employs a simple aluminium based casing drill shoe and float collar assembly, driven by a surface drive system that transmit torque from the top drive to the casing string4. Upon reaching targeted casing shoe depth, the cementing operation can commence almost immediately. The next conventional drilling assembly can then drill out the casing drilling assembly using a traditional PDC or rock bit without requirement for a special drill-out bit. The Maari Development Project in New Zealand is situated in an ideal soft drilling environment that is within the capability of the drillable drill shoe. During the project planning stage, non-retrievable drilling with casing technology was highlighted as a viable technology to improve drilling efficiency, reduce cementing times, protect the weak shallow formations the platform foundation depends on, and reduce potential risks. Substantial engineering effort and time have been invested to tackle all relevant technical issues. This paper presents the Maari Project's 24â€³ conductor drilling programme, covering the entire process from the planning stage through to the execution, which resulted in successfully installing and cementing nine strings of 24â€³ conductor ahead of the time allocated to conventionally drill, case, and cement eight strings.

TI  - Indirect Human Impacts Reverse Centuries of Carbon Sequestration and Salt Marsh Accretion
AB  - Direct and indirect human impacts on coastal ecosystems have increased over the last several centuries, leading to unprecedented degradation of coastal habitats and loss of ecological services. Here we document a two-century temporal disparity between salt marsh accretion and subsequent loss to indirect human impacts. Field surveys, manipulative experiments and GIS analyses reveal that crab burrowing weakens the marsh peat base and facilitates further burrowing, leading to bank calving, disruption of marsh accretion, and a loss of over two centuries of sequestered carbon from the marsh edge in only three decades. Analogous temporal disparities exist in other systems and are a largely unrecognized obstacle in attaining sustainable ecosystem services in an increasingly human impacted world. In light of the growing threat of indirect impacts worldwide and despite uncertainties in the fate of lost carbon, we suggest that estimates of carbon emissions based only on direct human impacts may significantly underestimate total anthropogenic carbon emissions.

TI  - Moroccan potentialities of renewable energy sources for water desalination
AB  - Morocco is characterised by a semi and climate and the decrease of the available surface water has a strong impact on the renewable resources of ground water. Without additional unconventional water sources, the water deficit will keep growing, even if more dams are built in the future, since they alone will not mobilise more water by capita. The obligation to use other non conventional water resources such as desalinated water or waste water reuse and the need for a more rigorous policy of water management and planning becomes a necessity. However Morocco has a large potential of wind and solar energy sources that could be used in the sea water desalination. The paper presents the experiences of the use of renewable energy sources in desalination in Morocco and an economic analysis of wind powered desalination in the south of Morocco.

TI  - Analysis of a polygeneration plant based on solar energy, dual mode solid oxide cells and desalination
AB  - Fossil fuels are stored energy during millions of years and we are using it in a rate that new fuels cannot be formed. Renewable energies are not available all the time and there is a need to find ways to store them. One way of storing renewable energies is in fuel form, similar to the fossil fuels and then use this stored fuel whenever needed. The plant design proposed in this paper consists of Dish-Stirling collectors supported by a reversible solid oxide cell acting as a power generator and storage unit, and therefore offering dispatchable power on demand. Further, the system reuses the waste heat for seawater desalination. The present work is an analytical study in which the performance evaluation of a self-sustainable polygeneration system with integrated hydrogen production, power generation, and freshwater production is conducted. An evaluation for selected days, representative for summer, fall, winter and spring in an area with low solar irradiation is studies to investigate the potential of this system to supply 500 kW continuously and simultaneously producing a considerable amount of freshwater. The study shows that the plant can produced hydrogen even in low irradiation winter days together with at least 6500 L of freshwater daily. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

TI  - AM20-LAB: ULTRA HIGH-DENSITY SIMULTANEOUS SOURCING TEST FOR NEAR-SURFACE CHARACTERIZATION AND DEEP-SEA MINERAL EXPLORATION
AB  - Norway could start licensing companies for deep-sea mining in 2023. It passed a law that allows exploration and production of seabed metals that are in high demand in green technologies (e.g. electric vehicle batteries, wind turbines, and solar farms) and rare earth minerals (with countless applications including clean energy, robotics, and nanotechnology). This first licensing round can influence other countries to open their deep-water areas for mining. The oil & gas industry has developed highly sophisticated technology for offshore exploration, with a focus on deep targets but without disregarding the near-surface. The advent of new commercial activity motivated the offshore mineral exploration field test survey, acquired as part of the AM20-Lab, presented here. The novel survey design uses the latest 3D seismic acquisition and imaging technologies and implements a decasource simultaneous sourcing schedule with signal apparition encoding. In this work, we present an initial view of this field test and benchmark it against a modern dataset acquired with five sources and the same vessel a few weeks earlier. This early analysis shows that the survey design, acquisition, and time processing are fit-for-purpose. This cost-effective design enables measuring ultra high resolution seismic for enhanced shallow target characterization. Â© (2021) by the European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers (EAGE)

TI  - Mangrove Trace Metal Biogeochemistry Response to Global Climate Change
AB  - This review discusses observed impacts from different climate change-driven pressures on mangrove's role in modulating trace metal transfer at the land-ocean interface. It contributes to the literature in a global context and shows mangroves as mitigators or providing positive feedback to metal mobilization. Most chalcophile metals(2+) accumulate in mangrove soils associated with sulfides while high sedimentation rates avoid their oxidation. Exudation of oxygen by roots fixates Fe, which co-precipitates metals as oxyhydroxides in the rhizosphere. These two biogeochemical processes reduce trace metal availability to plants and their mobility within estuaries. However, climate change-driven pressures alter this geochemical equilibrium. Increasing atmospheric CO2 and temperature, and the intensity and frequency of extreme climatic events, have proved to affect mangrove functioning and cover, but no direct observation on the impact on metal biogeochemistry is presently available, whereas sea level rise and saline intrusion impacts on the fate of metals have already been observed. Sea level rise increases erosion, that dissociates deposited sulfides releasing metals to the water column. Released metals adsorb onto suspended particles and can re-deposit in the estuary or are exported to continental shelf sediments. Saline intrusion may oxidize deeper sediment layers releasing metals to porewaters. Part of the mobilized metals may remain in solution complexed with DOM and have their bioavailability increased, as shown by high bioaccumulation factors and biomagnification and high metal concentrations in the estuarine biota, which results in higher human exposure through fisheries consumption. Since erosion occurs preferentially at the sea border and higher sedimentation at the higher reaches of the estuary, triggering mangroves migration landward, spatial gradients are formed, and shall be taken into consideration when planning mitigation or adaptation strategies. These observations suggest disruption of traditional humans dwelling in mangrove dominated coastlines by increasing contamination of coastal fisheries, often the principal protein source for those groups and an important source of income. Further research into the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of climate change driven alterations to metal biogeochemical processes in mangroves as contaminant levels are expected to increase.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of Environmental Impacts of Operational Phases of Three Selected Microalgal Cultivation Systems
AB  - In recent years, microalgal biomass cultivation has been growing in importance, not only related to the production of alternative foods and nutritional supplements but also for its usage for energy purposes or as a natural solution for wastewater treatment. Regarding these cases, the practical potential associated with the circular economy is evident. However, this is not an option for microalgal food and supplements due to strict hygiene requirements for microalgae cultivation used for these purposes. Currently, the most common cultivation options for microalgae include phototrophic cascades, photobioreactors, and heterotrophic fermenters. Generally, the higher requirements for the purity of the resulting biomass, the higher the consumption of energy and nutrients needed. These are the main operational parameters that significantly shape the total environmental and economic performance of microalgae cultivation processes. The comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of environmental aspects in the operational phases of three selected cultivation systems, located in the Czech Republic and used for pure microalgae biomass production, confirmed that the impacts of these systems in the assessed categories are fundamentally dependent on the amount of electricity needed and nutrient consumption, as well as their sources. For this reason, the heterotrophic fermenter was evaluated as being the most damaging in the comparison of the three cultivation systems, while the phototrophic cascade showed a lower total environmental impact by 15\% and the flat photobioreactor was lower still, by 95\%, mainly due to energy production from biomass. The major impact categories observed were climate change, depletion of fossil fuels, human toxicity, and freshwater and marine ecotoxicity. The environmental impacts of microalgae cultivation systems could be further reduced if cycling practices, such as process water recycling and reprocessing of generated sewage sludge, were addressed.

TI  - Indonesian operator's first field-wide application of intelligent-well technology - A case history
AB  - The first successful field-wide application of intelligent-well completion technology has been used in Indonesia to commingle "free energy" from an overlying gas cap to support production from underlying oil reservoirs that typically have a high water-cut. Previously, the wells in this offshore field had been developed as conventional gas-lift completions that used gas supplied from outside the platform. The application of an "auto gas-lift" (AGL) concept using intelligent well technology removed the capital equipment associated with conventional gas lift compleions as well as the conventional downhole completion gas-lift equipment. This innovative technology provided added value from: 1. Elimination of well intervention (for gas-lift operations using slickline). 2. Acceleration of first production 3. Reduction of capital expenditures (eliminated compressor package and subsea pipeline) 4. Capability to set the gas lift at the deepest point of the well without angle limitation. 5. Enhanced operational safety. Additional value may be realized from additional wells as they are completed and brought on-line. This paper discusses the candidate selection challenges as well as the design criteria for these auto-gas-lift intelligent wells. Specifically, the challenges have to consider the following: 1. With an AGL intelligent well, production of the gas is uncertain and will change with time 2. Equipment specifications must be suitable for the range of performance of the gas and oil reservoir, the fluid composition, and the reservoir pressures. These factors all had to be taken into account when designing the system. Results to-date will illustrate the operational success of this application as well as the value added to the completions.

TI  - Coastal works post-construction effectiveness validation in Eforie Bay area
AB  - The design of the new protection scheme in the Eforieâ€™s area was done based on yearly averaged incident waves from the dominant NE wave energy direction, with associated preferred coastline, which agrees well with a natural behavior of the present shoreline. The sand nourishments were constructing the new overall orientation of the computed shoreline, now in post-construction period corresponding to a new orientation of the coastline. The present work presents the functional effectiveness of the model simulation for the existing hydro-morphological development patterns, together with the calculations of the erosion rates and adjacent effects of the structures, such as the submerged breakwaters and the groins extensions, contributing to the compensation annual rates for maintenance of the artificial beach extension in this sector. Thus, the contribution of the extreme events/winter waveâ€™s regime to the calculation of the average sediment loss, in the southern adjacent area to the Constanta Port, requires an annual maintenance for correction.

AB  - Many of the mature fields operated by Petronas Cargali Sdn. Bhd. (PCSB) still contain substantial recoverable reserves. However, a limited number of spare well slots or re-entry possibilities are available on existing platform structures from which new wells can be drilled. To develop its mature fields, PCSB has identified twin-well technology as a viable, relatively low-risk means of further developing such fields offshore Sarawak. The drilling and completion procedures for this system are the same as those for conventional wellhead equipment. The system is flexible and allows batch drilling and completion.

TI  - Nanostructured metallic materials in extreme environments
AB  - Severe high pressure, high temperature downhole environment in gas and oil industry, and high dose radiation in nuclear reactors posed significant challenges for the application of metallic materials. In this paper, we will review our recent discovery of nanostructured triphase metallic materials that have extraordinary high temperature thermal stability. These nanostructured metallic materials also have high mechanical strength than their coarse grained counterparts. Metallic multilayers with immiscible layer interface also have the potential for accomplishment of high temperature thermal stability. Furthermore these immiscible multilayers have extraordinary radiation resistance. By using in situ radiation experiments inside a transmission electron microscope, we show that nanostructured multilayers have exceptional radiation tolerance with capability to remove radiation induced dislocation loops. Advanced materials are clearly necessary for their application in various extreme environments. Under this context, nanostructured metallic materials metals have emerged as promising candidates with superior damage tolerance. The rapid development of numerous energy sectors calls for the design of advanced materials. Taking gas and oil industry as an example, the continuous push towards high temperature and high pressure downhole environment put increasing challenges to sustainability of currently employed metallic materials. In parallel, next generation nuclear reactors are being and designed to provide increasing service lifetime and enhanced safety and reliability. Materials to be employed to construct these reactors needs to withhold higher temperature, much aggressive radiation dose and in many cases corrosive environment. The properties of traditional metallic materials cannot accommodate these requirements. Extensive studies are being performed to search for novel metallic materials with unprecedented advanced properties. In this paper, we will discuss strategies to enhance thermal stability and radiation tolerance of metallic materials. Two examples will be provided to illustrate the ideas.

TI  - Muddy Waters: Unintentional Consequences of Blue Carbon Research Obscure Our Understanding of Organic Carbon Dynamics in Seagrass Ecosystems
AB  - The recent surge in research on organic carbon sequestration by seagrass ecosystems has begun to reveal the complexity of the carbon cycle within these ecosystems. In this prospective we discuss two areas of investigation that require further scrutiny: (1) why organic carbon is stabilized in seagrass sediments, and (2) how long organic carbon resides within these sediments. By delving into these topics, pointing out current pitfalls, and highlighting methodological advances, our motive is to focus future efforts and provide a frame work to manage the complexity found within the diverse seagrass bioregions. The high rate of seagrass degradation and loss, coupled with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations gives precedence to these lines of research, which require rigorous reevaluation if we are to substantially advance our understanding of OC dynamics in seagrass ecosystems.

TI  - The contribution from an operator's global subsea hardware standardization program to 10K subsea hardware on Parque das Conchas (BC-10)
AB  - The Parque das Conchas field in Campos basin offshore Brasil is a phased ultra-deepwater heavy oil development tied to the Espirito Santos floating, production, storage and offload (FPSO) vessel, moored at a water depth of 1,780-meters. The subsea system utilizes a subsea boosting and separation technology, enhanced recovery through water and gas injection, subsea sampling, enhanced vertical deepwater trees (EVDT), steel lazy wave catenary risers, and high voltage multiplexed electro-hydraulic steel tube umbilicals. During its nine year development since sanctioning, the professionals, installation contractors, commercial and contractual conditions have changed and played their role on the successful deployment of the subsea systems architecture. The project's successful track history to date is largely attributed to the development and consistent application of standardized subsea hardware throughout its three distinct and independently developed phases. This paper addresses the standardized features applied to the 10,000-psi (10K) rated subsea system components at BC-10: EVDT systems and tooling, including the upper completion tools which allowed deployment through either a subsea or surface blow-out preventer; completion and intervention riser systems on the lower riser package; retrievable flow modules and flow meters; production and injection jumper kits; manifolds; subsea boosting and separation; subsea control modules; umbilicals and subsea distribution hardware. This paper also addresses how these features fit within the operator's global subsea hardware standardization program, and provides examples on how continuous improvement, lessons learned and innovations are implemented in that program.

TI  - Restoration and validation of an autochthonous salt dome - Lessons from the butch discovery, offshore Norway
AB  - Kinematic restoration has been widely used to assess the validity of geological interpretations and constrain the timing and nature of structural development. The techniques attempt to transform a 2D section and/or 3D geological model from one deformational state to another while conserving bed length, area or volume. This approach has proven particularly effective for unraveling the development of salt provinces, where the deformation associated with salt-related movement can add significant structural complexity. Traditional restoration involves a combination of backstripping, restoration of horizons to a regional level and removal of across-fault offsets. Salt, which often masks deformation on seismic reflection surveys, cannot be restored directly using these techniques and is, therefore, assumed to flow out of the model as the overlying sedimentary basins develop. In this paper the principals behind forward modelling and restoring a salt diapir are detailed and evaluated with respect to the development of an active salt dome adjacent to the Butch Discovery, offshore Norway (Centrica (operator, 40%), Suncor Energy (30%), Faroe Petroleum (15%), and Tullow Oil (15%)). The presented results consider the impact and significance of different kinematic unfolding algorithms and the importance of out-of-plane movement when working in two and three dimensions.

TI  - IAEA activities on the nuclear desalination of sea water
AB  - Interest in using nuclear energy to produce potable water, an indispensable resource for human living, has grown worldwide over the past decade. This has been motivated by a wide variety of reasons, inter alia, from the economic competitiveness of nuclear energy to energy supply diversification, from the conservation of limited fossil fuel resources to environmental protection. In response to this trend, since 1989 the IAEA has co-ordinated various feasibility studies on nuclear desalination of sea water with the participation of interested Member States. A number of these states have supported these activities by providing expertise, relevant information and financial resources. An overview is given of what the IAEA has accomplished and how it can play a role in promoting the peaceful use of nuclear energy, thus contributing towards solving the potable water supply problem in the next century. The results of work done within the framework of the IAEA's nuclear desalination programme over the past years have shown that application of nuclear energy to sea water desalination is a realistic option. The challenge ahead is to demonstrate use of a nuclear desalination plant by proceeding with effective development and practical applications.

TI  - Trends in Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions from 1990 to 2010
AB  - Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are known to alter hydrological cycles, disrupt marine ecosystems and species lifecycles, and cause global habitat loss. In this study, we use a comprehensive global input-output database to assess the driving forces underlying the change in global CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2010. We decompose the change in emissions for the 20 year period into six mutually exclusive causal determinants. Our assessment of trends in fuel-use reveals that a 10.8 Peta-gram (Pg) rise in emissions from 1990 to 2010 constitutes emissions from the consumption of coal (49%), petroleum (25%), natural gas (17%), and biomass (9%). We demonstrate that affluence (per-capita consumption) and population growth are outpacing any improvements in carbon efficiency in driving up emissions worldwide. Our results suggest that supply chain measures to improve technological efficiency are not sufficient to reduce emissions. To achieve significant emission savings, policy makers need to address the issue of affluence. We argue that policies to address unsustainable lifestyles and consumer behavior are largely unheard of, and governments may need to actively intervene in nonsustainable lifestyles to achieve emission reductions. The results presented in this paper are vital for informing future policy decisions for mitigating climate change. Â© 2016 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Inspection and monitoring of girassol hybrid riser towers
AB  - More than three years after installation of the Girassol Hybrid Riser Towers, this paper aims at presenting the choices made in terms of inspection and monitoring on such equipment and their inspection results. The access for inspection is very restricted and the riser tower design is based on a zero inspection and maintenance concept: FMEA studies conducted during the design phase have led to incorporate changes in the final design and the project has worked to eliminate the areas of concern. However, external cathodic protection measurements, general and close visual inspection by ROV are regularly performed. These inspection activities are implemented within the framework of a general sub-sea inspection strategy defined through a Risk-Based Inspection approach. The results of inspection are compiled in a dedicated Computerized Inspection Management System (CIMS). So far, the riser towers have not shown any significant defect or anomaly. The temperature of the production spools at the base of the towers is monitored with sensors. The data recovered from these sensors, together with data collected from topside instruments, allows monitoring the thermal performance of the towers. This is critical in ensuring that the risk of hydrate formation in the system is minimized. Â© 2005, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Sediment transport and carbon sequestration characteristics along mangrove fringed coasts
AB  - Mangroves play an important role in sequestering carbon and trapping sediments. However, the effectiveness of such functions is unclear due to the restriction of knowledge on the sedimentation process across the vegetation boundaries. To detect the effects of mangrove forests on sediment transportation and organic carbon sequestration, the granulometric and organic carbon characteristics of mangrove sediments were investigated from three vegetation zones of four typical mangrove habitats on the Leizhou Peninsula coast. Based on our results, sediment transport was often ``environmentally sensitive{''} to the vegetation friction. A transition of the sediment transport mode from the mudflat zone to the interior/fringe zone was often detected from the cumulative frequency curve. The vegetation cover also assists the trapping of material, resulting in a significantly higher concentration of organic carbon in the interior surface sediments. However, the graphic parameters of core sediments reflected a highly temporal variability due to the sedimentation process at different locations. The sediment texture ranges widely from sand to mud, although the sedimentary environments are restricted within the same energy level along the fluvial-marine transition zone. Based on the PCA results, the large variation was mainly attributed to either the mean grain size features or the organic carbon features. A high correlation between the depth and delta C-13 value also indicated an increasing storage of mangrove-derived organic carbon with time.

TI  - Planning EOR projects in offshore oil fields
AB  - Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) technologies can significantly increase recovery from oil reservoirs. Some of these EOR technologies are currently producing substantial incremental oil, primarily in onshore applications; others have not yet made a commercial impact. The application of these methods is more complex in the offshore environment, as space and weight restrictions, as well as the need for high reliability and the challenging economics of such projects, impose constraints not present in onshore applications. All EOR processes are reservoir- and reservoir fluid-specific; thus it is necessary to identify the appropriate EOR technology for use in a reservoir, design the project to achieve the required economic incremental recovery within the constraints imposed by the offshore environment, and manage the project to meet or exceed expectations. This paper will focus on the impact of the offshore environment on the planning, design and management of an EOR project. Â© 2005, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Developing a smart port architecture and essential elements in the era of Industry 4.0
AB  - With rapid technological innovations spurred by the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0), today's seaports are pressured to transform the way they operate in order to handle traffic flows. Such a transformation calls for the development of a smart port system. Despite the growing interest in smart ports, their underlying framework, architecture, and potential ramifications for port productivity are not well documented in the maritime logistics literature. To help port communities better comprehend smart port concepts and successfully develop a smart port within a global supply chain, this paper synthesizes core smart port concepts, designs underlying architecture, and proposes specific milestones for monitoring the smart port development project. We use content analysis and then we identify key success factors (e.g., essential components for the smart port architecture, value propositions, smart port performance metrics) for the establishment and sustainable growth of the smart port. The paper also aims to provide practical guidance for dealing with smart port challenges and opportunities. Our research reveals that a smart port reduces port-user response time, improves port asset utilization, and enhances maritime logistics visibility by automating and integrating end-to-end port operations digitally without human intervention.

TI  - Dry sea state monitoring for more efficient marine operations
AB  - Marine Operations such as pipe laying, subsea installations, heavy lifting operations, work-over operations, crane operations are extremely sensitive to metocean conditions. Wind, wave and currents from different directions and long period wave motion can cause adverse vessel response which may impair operations. Thus, without systematic sea state monitoring, marine operations sensitive to wind, wave height, wave period and vessel motion can be subject to delays, cost overruns, safety issues, and asset damage. Precise knowledge of the sea state during such operations is an essential requirement which has become more critical as offshore activities have moved into ever greater water depths, and into hostile frontier areas. This calls for a reliable and accurate on-board system for continuous, real-time wave and motion monitoring and recording. Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Hybrid concentrated solar power (CSP)-desalination systems: A review
AB  - Desalination market is experiencing continuous growth due to severe water scarcity in many parts of the globe. Because of the geographical coincidence of serious water scarcity and substantial direct normal irradiation potential, concentrated solar power (CSP) driven desalination presents a potential means to tackle water scarcity. Since CSPs can generate both electricity and thermal energy, they are excellent candidates to drive desalination technologies. This review article provides an overview of the status of state-of-the-art hybrid CSP-desalination systems. The paper reviews published studies on hybrid plants under two categories: only freshwater generation and cogenerating of power and freshwater. This review demonstrates that there are several potential ways to hybridize CSPs with desalination systems. Future research directions on CSP-desalination systems can be classified into researches on CSP technologies, desalination systems and integration schemes. Specifically, improvement of solar collection and desalination equipment, through cost reduction and efficiency enhancement, remains the largest hurdles to overcome. Developing novel hybrid schemes, by maximizing the thermal efficiency and minimizing the costs, offers a potential means to accelerate commercialization of such hybrid plants. Overall, the CSP-desalination plants are technically and environmentally attractive but there is still significant progress to be made for such plants to be economically feasible.

TI  - Sediment accumulation in embayments controlled by bathymetric slope and wave energy: Implications for beach formation and persistence
AB  - High energy, rocky coastlines often feature sandy beaches within headland-bound embayments. Not all such embayments have beaches however, and beaches in embayments can be removed by storms and may subsequently reform. What dictates the presence or absence of an embayed beach and its resilience to storms? In this paper, we explore the effect of offshore slope and wind conditions on nearshore sediment transport within idealised embayments to give insight into nearshore sediment supplies. We use numerical simulations to show that sand can accumulate near shore if the offshore slope is >0.025 m/m, but only under persistent calm conditions. Our modelling also suggests that if sediment in an embayment with an offshore gradient steeper than 0.025 m/m is removed during a period of persistent stormy conditions, it will be unlikely to return in sub-decadal timescales. In contrast, sediment located in embayments with shallower gradients can reform swiftly in both calm and stormy conditions. Our findings have wide implications for contemporary coastal engineering in the face of future global climate change, but also for Quaternary environmental reconstruction. Our simple method to predict beach stability based on slope can be used to interpret differing responses of embayments to periods of changing coastal storminess such as the medieval climate anomaly-little ice age (MCA-LIA) transition.

TI  - LAKE LEVEL REGULATION AND SHORELINE EROSION ON FLATHEAD LAKE, MONTANA - A RESPONSE TO THE REDISTRIBUTION OF ANNUAL WAVE ENERGY
AB  - Concern regarding increased coastal erosion has heightened amid growing acceptance of global warming and associated sea-level rise. Attention has focused on the absolute elevation of sea-level rise, whereas shoreline erosion may result more from the redistribution of wave energy over the duration of the sea-level rise. This study examines shoreline erosion in Flathead Lake, Montana, resulting from a redistribution of annual wave energy due to five decades of regulated lake levels by a dam at the lake's outlet. The annual rise in lake level is held for an extended duration at a regulated `'full pool'' level which is approximately 3 m above its natural base elevation. The total time for a complete cycle of lake level change also has been increased from 100 days to over 300 days.         Alteration of the natural lake level fluctuation has resulted in a transfer of annual wave energy from base elevations corresponding to the pre-dam nearshore shelf, to elevations corresponding to the limnetic foreshore environment, thereby inducing lake-wide erosion. The most extensive erosion has occurred along the low-lying dissipative north shore of the lake. The redistribution of annual wave energy due to regulated lake level fluctuation is the main factor contributing to that erosion. The redistribution of annual incident wave energy is examined in terms of an increase in the duration of the complete natural lake-level cycle, a reduced range in lake level fluctuation, and an elevated full pool lake level. Both the duration of lake level cycle and range in water level fluctuation affect the distribution of incident wave energy and were found to be more important to shoreline erosion than an absolute elevated water level. An alternative regulation scheme incorporating concerns for both hydropower production and lake recreation is proposed and examined in terms of reducing erosion. Altering the regulated lake level fluctuation by changing the timing and increasing the rate of lake level drawdown, would result in a significant reduction in the amount of annual wave energy that reaches the eroding full pool shoreline, thereby reducing the potential for take-wide shoreline erosion.

TI  - Investments in Unsettled Maritime Boundary Contexts: The Role of Bilateral Investment Treaties in Delivering Certainty
AB  - Interest in offshore investment is growing: the oil and gas sector has been developing offshore reserves for some time; more recently, the renewable energy sector has also been investing offshore. In that context, this paper considers the legal uncertainties that overlapping sovereign claims in offshore areas create for investments. It then canvasses the commitments that States can accord to address these legal uncertainties, whether unilaterally or through inter-State authorities that jointly regulate areas subject to overlapping claims. This paper is then principally devoted to considering the role of bilateral investment treaties in enforcing such commitments, and otherwise addressing the legal uncertainties generated by overlapping maritime claims. By way of conclusion, this paper considers analogies to other situations where investments are subject to the sovereign rights of more than one State.

TI  - High-Frequency CO2 System Variability Over the Winter-to-Spring Transition in a Coastal Plain Estuary
AB  - Understanding the vulnerability of estuarine ecosystems to anthropogenic impacts requires a quantitative assessment of the dynamic drivers of change to the carbonate (CO2) system. Here we present new high-frequency pH data from a moored sensor. These data are combined with discrete observations to create continuous time series of total dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO2), CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)), and carbonate saturation state. We present two deployments over the winter-to-spring transition in the lower York River (where it meets the Chesapeake Bay mainstem) in 2016/2017 and 2017/2018. TCO2 budgets with daily resolution are constructed, and contributions from circulation, air-sea CO2 exchange, and biology are quantified. We find that TCO2 is most strongly influenced by circulation and biological processes; pCO(2) and pH also respond strongly to changes in temperature. The system transitions from autotrophic to heterotrophic conditions multiple times during both deployments; the conventional view of a spring bloom and subsequent summer production followed by autumn and winter respiration may not apply to this region. Despite the dominance of respiration in winter and early spring, surface waters were undersaturated with respect to atmospheric CO2 for the majority of both deployments with mean fluxes ranging from -9 to -5 mmol C center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1). Deployments a year apart indicate that the seasonal transition in the CO2 system differs significantly from one year to the next and highlights the necessity of sustained monitoring in dynamic nearshore environments.

TI  - Spool sep for subsea produced water separation - Experimental results
AB  - Subsea Processing provides effective solutions to develop more and more challenging deepwater fields while maximizing oil recovery and optimizing the topsides. By removing most of produced water at the seabed, a subsea liquid/liquid separation station allows to eliminate the need to transport high volumes of water from deepwater mature fields production and then to debottleneck existing topside facilities and to reduce the required water treatment surface equipment. Moreover, the low subsea separation pressure reducing the back pressure on the subsea wellhead allows for an increase in oil recovery, which is a key driver for such a system. Dealing with the deepwater and high design pressures constraints, the SpoolSep, developed by Saipem for subsea gravity liquid-liquid separation, is made of several horizontal pipes working in parallel. The use of small and long diameter pipes for effective gravity separation of produced water combines robustness and efficiency. The pipes are designed as subsea spools which can be connected and disconnected individually for easy installation and maintenance. A first test campaign was performed in 2013 on a purpose built multiphase flow loop operating with air, water, and model oils at ambient conditions using a transparent SpoolSep model made of four parallel Plexiglas pipes of 200mm ID and 18m length each. Different inlet conditions, such as flowrates, water cut, gas-volume factor, shear rate on water/oil mixtures, water residence time, and spool inclination, were tested to qualify the separator efficiency and operability, resulting in a whole flow visualisation inside the pipes. Additional tests using several solid particle sizes were performed to qualify sand deposition and determine the limits of sand transport by fluid flowing inside a single spool. The paper presents the main findings of the experimental tests that validated the multiphase flow distribution inside the spools, levels control and symmetry. Moreover, the validation of the SpoolSep design criteria regarding required separation performances is presented. Main observations and key findings on tests with sand are also described. The presented work focused on the development and qualification of the fluid processing technology and does not make mention of any mechanical or structural design work.

TI  - A review of waste heat recovery technologies for maritime applications
AB  - A waste heat recovery system produces power by utilizing the heat energy lost to the surroundings from thermal processes, at no additional fuel input. For marine vessels, about 50 percent of the total fuel energy supplied to diesel power-plant aboard is lost to the surroundings. While the total amount of wasted energy is considerable, the quality of this energy is quite low due to its low temperature and has limited potential for power production. Effective waste heat recovery systems use the available low temperature waste heat to produce mechanical/electrical power with high efficiency value. In this study a review of different waste heat recovery systems has been conducted, to lay out the potential recovery efficiencies and suitability for marine applications. This work helps in identifying the most suitable heat recovery technologies for maritime use depending on the properties of shipboard waste heat and achievable recovery efficiencies, whilst discussing the features of each type of system.

TI  - Synthesis of Sunlight, Seawater and CO2 based Industrial Parks
AB  - In response to climate change concerns, there has been an increasing global commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Circular economy pillars have been proposed as a means to conserve resources, limit emissions and maintain sustainable revenue streams. Most CO2 emissions stem from stationary sources, which are largely due to industrial processes (IPCC, 2005). In an attempt to reduce these emissions, there has been an increased focus on carbon capture utilization and storage solutions, e.g. integrating carbon dioxide in industrial parks to create value-added products. Ahmed et al. (2020) introduced a method that can represent any resource, material or energy, within a cluster to identify integration potential. In this work, we utilize the mixed integer linear program to synthesize waste reuse clusters at zero carbon footprint. The work mainly assesses the potential benefits of utilizing waste resources such as CO2 emissions, free resources such as seawater (H2O and its minerals), air (N2, and O2) and sunlight as an energy source to produce various value-added products to create carbon neutral industrial parks. This attempt demonstrates circular economy values on an industrial park level by conserving fresh resources, maximizing reuse of materials and creating valuable products. The system studied was able to generate profits while adhering to emission and material constraints. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A review of renewable energy utilization in islands
AB  - With the surge in the fossil fuel prices and increasing environmental concerns, significant efforts have been made to propel and develop alternative energy technologies to cope with the energy shortage for island power grids. Recent advancements and developments on power electronic technologies have enabled the renewable energy sources to be grid-connected with gradually higher penetration in island electricity supply. Consequently, the utilization and efficiency of renewable energy resources in islands has received remarkable attention from both the academia and industry. In this paper, a brief overview on the current status of island energy resources is described. Then, the existing utilization status and development potential of various renewable generations for island power grids, including solar, wind, hydropower, biomass, ocean and geothermal energy, are investigated. Furthermore, the advanced technologies to improve the penetration level of island renewables, including energy storage techniques, hybrid renewable energy system, microgrid, demand side management, distributed generation and smart grid, are presented.

TI  - Control System Design and Implementation at Flexible, Distributed Offshore Sensor Test Sites in the Yangtze Estuary Area
AB  - Marine in situ testing is a necessary step for stereotyping newly developed marine sensors. The use of test sites in the Yangtze Estuary area, which has high turbidity and abundant nutrients, can effectively reduce the needed testing time owing to its harsh conditions. Five test stations were established, and a floating buoy and fixed test equipment were designed. A control system, including a sensor connection, data processor, video remote transmission, and corresponding control algorithm, was developed. The control system enabled the nondestructive monitoring of biological attachments and bidirectional, real-time communication between an upper server on land and the control system at the test sites. The dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, and pH data of DOS600 and DPS600 sensors were compared with those of AP2000 sensors. Temperature recording using the DOS600 sensor was performed nearly as well as that of the AP2000 sensor. The mean DO values (standard deviations) were 8.414 mg L-1 (2.068) and 6.896 mg L-1 (1.235) for the DOS600 and AP2000 sensors, respectively, indicating that the DOS600 performance was unsatisfactory. The pH recording of the DPS600 was slightly worse than that of the AP2000 sensor. Experimental results showed that the DO value was more easily affected by the buoy movement of waves compared to the pH and temperature. Moreover, data fluctuations showed that the DO and pH parameters were more vulnerable to biofouling than temperature. Waves and biofouling create a harsh test environment, and the performance difference between the developed sensors and a standard sensor can be obtained in a short time period.

TI  - The economics of an integrated CO2 capture and sequestration system: Texas Gulf Coast case study
AB  - Using a power generation dispatch model of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) to estimate CO2 capture from retrofitting an existing coal power plant, this paper estimates the system cost and revenue associated with handling CO2 input and output mismatch in an integrated source-sink pipeline by installing more injection wells into a saline reservoir to handle peak CO2 capture rates. The fluctuations in CO2 capture (e.g. supply) are assumed to come from an existing coal-fired power plant in Texas operating according to a merit-order dispatch model with an imposed CO2 price. We analyze a 20-year cash flow with CO2 demand for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) based upon a nominal purchase schedule over an 11-year lifespan of a high-quality candidate oil field, Conroe, along the Gulf Coast of Texas. With an assumed structured and inflexible use of CO2 for EOR, the deeper saline reservoir can sequester captured CO2 that is not injected for EOR. By performing a cash flow analysis with and without the EOR field and saline reservoirs included, the economic costs and benefits of coupling EOR and saline storage to a single coal generator are determined for a specific Texas case study. At low CO2 prices, the EOR reservoir contributes more value than the saline reservoir, but the opposite is true at high CO2 prices. This answer can be partly explained because as CO2 price increases, the analysis assumes constant demand of electricity and endogenously increases electricity prices but uses an exogenous constant oil price. The method can be generalized to include additional coal-based plants as well as EOR and saline reservoirs in Texas to envision an entire carbon capture and sequestration network in a region with high EOR potential.

TI  - The importance of periodic reassessment of operational strategies for wax management
AB  - Periodic reassessment of flow assurance risks is a critical topic for greenfield and brownfield projects hoping to ensure an optimal risk management strategy in addition to efficient operations. Greenfield projects must understand the value of flow assurance risk monitoring in order to operate efficiently and reliably throughout the asset life to ensure maximum value is captured. Brownfield operations, in the current market, are continuously looking for methods to reduce cost while maintaining operational excellence. Recently, a comprehensive field optimization of an offshore brownfield application was conducted that focused on a re-evaluation of incumbent wax management strategies for pipelines and flowlines. Balancing pigging schedules with chemical injection is the most common wax mitigation, yet over time drivers for risk management plans can change - specifically for activities like regular pigging of flowlines. The team reviewed extensive laboratory testing of current and potential wax inhibitor chemicals to determine expected performance. The lab results, coupled with operational constraints and recent pigging campaign results, led to a recommendation for a new wax management strategy. Results of the campaign were successful; a dramatic reduction in the wax chemicals required to maintain a manageable wax deposition, and an optimized pigging schedule which resulted in a reduction in operating expenses exceeding $5 million per year. This value creation was a direct result of emphasizing a reassessment of flow assurance risks - specifically waxes - of operating assets. This work will emphasize that flow assurance risks must be continually monitored - to ensure the risk profile has not changed for better or worse, and to identify opportunities to adjust mitigation methods to capture cost savings and/or added value.

TI  - New Insights from Legacy Seismic Data, Offshore Nova Scotia
AB  - Reprocessing and analysis of legacy datasets has become an economic alternative to acquiring new data. Beginning in 2020, the Nova Scotia Department of Energy and Mines underwent a project with Schlumberger to reprocess the Barrington narrow-azimuth, 3D surface seismic survey and subsequently complete a rock physics and AVO study using the newly reprocessed data. Using contemporary processing techniques such as broadband processing and high-resolution tomography, the 3D survey was reprocessed to a full tilted transverse isotropy Kirchhoff prestack depth migration (KPSDM) from the legacy isotropic Kirchhoff time migration. The reprocessed data has provided significant data quality improvement, specifically within the deep cretaceous and Jurassic sections. This enhancement has revealed several interesting anomalies in the Jurassic, specifically from a source rock perspective, and have reconfirmed previous play concepts. The rock physics, AVO and Inversion analysis revealed features such as clear conformance with structure, gathers dimming with offset and downdip amplitude dimming and terminations.

AB  - Due to the urge of human interest in isolating natural products from marine biodiversity for food or health commercial and industrial purposes, marine bioprospecting has increased rapidly in recent years and holds important promise for the future. Indonesian Sargassum species are one of the marine species of brown algae with substantial values. Their wide range of potentiality, especially their bioactive compounds, make them a natural resource for various applications in food, cosmetic and pharmacological sectors. Thus, the bioprospecting of Sargassum species is becoming an interesting topic to discuss, especially for Indonesia where only the red macroalgae Kappaphycus sp and Gracilaria sp are exported. This review illustrates the potential applications of Sargassum species concerning their bioactive chemodiversity. Further, possible challenges for sustainable development of Indonesia are also be described.

TI  - Enhancement of photosynthetic carbon assimilation efficiency by phytoplankton in the future coastal ocean
AB  - A mesocosm experiment was conducted to evaluate the influence of photosynthetic performance on the energetic balance of coastal phytoplankton, in relation to community production and autotrophic phytoplankton biomass in future coastal oceans. Natural phytoplankton assemblages were incubated in field mesocosms under ambient condition (control: ca. 400 mu atm CO2 and ambient temperature), and two sets of potential future ocean conditions (acidification: ca. 900 mu atm CO2 and ambient temperature; greenhouse: ca. 900 mu atm CO2 and 3 degrees C warmer). The photosynthetic performances were estimated by in vivo fluorometry (effective quantum yield (Phi(PSII)), steady-state light response curves (LCs)) and in situ incorporation of C-14 (photosynthesisirradiance curves). The Phi(PSII) and rETR(m,LC) (relative maximum electron transport rate) clearly reduced under acidification, in particular, when phytoplankton were exposed to high light levels. However, P-max(B) (maximum photosynthetic rate) was the same in the ambient and acidification conditions. Thus, phytoplankton utilized less light under acidification condition, but could still assimilate a similar amount of carbon compared to the ambient condition. The P-max(B) and alpha (photosynthetic efficiency) under greenhouse condition were significantly higher than those under ambient condition without any difference in Phi(PSII), rETR(m,LC) and alpha(,LC) (electron transport efficiency) between the treatments. Therefore, phytoplankton utilized the same amount of light under greenhouse condition, but could assimilate more carbon than under ambient condition. As a result, Chl a normalized primary production was higher in greenhouse than in other conditions. Nevertheless, the community production did not change between the experimental treatments. The main reason for the lack of a change in primary production under future climate conditions is the control of autotrophic phytoplankton biomass by grazing. Consequently, acidification and greenhouse environments have a potential to increase growth and primary production of phytoplankton by enhancing inorganic carbon assimilation efficiency when top-down regulation is negligible.

TI  - Power Source Management and Electrical Fault Mitigation in Seafloor Networks
AB  - Initially deployed in 2010, the CSnet Offshore Communication Backbone (OCB) located in the Mediterranean Sea approximately 100km off the south coast of Cyprus contains oceanographic sensors and an array of seismometers providing scientists with valuable real time data for analysis. Recently, it was decided to transition the power and communications feed to the OCB seafloor network from a buoy located directly above the network to a shore-based supply utilizing two telecommunication cables (known as Poseidon, owned and operated by Radius Oceanic Communications, Inc.) connected to shore. To maintain redundancy after a potential electrical shunt fault occurs on one of the telecommunication cables, resulting in a power short to seawater, the OCB requires load-sharing diodes between the power feeding cables and the nodes. The seafloor network nodes, designed and built by OceanWorks, can be expensive to recover, so an alternative approach to adding load-sharing diodes had to be developed. This paper discusses the migration of a seafloor network to a redundant power feed architecture without the recovery of the seafloor network nodes and successful mitigation of a potential electrical shunt fault

TI  - Climate Engineering: Economic Considerations and Research Challenges
AB  - Climate engineering measures are designed to either reduce atmospheric carbon concentration (by growing trees or spreading iron in the ocean, for example) or directly influence the radiation reaching or leaving the earth (by injecting sulfur into the stratosphere or modifying cloud formations, for example) to compensate for greenhouse gas-induced warming. The former measures are termed carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which we characterize as a low-leverage causative approach, and the latter are termed radiation management (RM), which we characterize as a high-leverage symptomatic approach. There are similarities between CDR and emission control. Accordingly, benefit-cost analysis can be used to assess certain CDR measures. By contrast, high-leverage RM represents a genuinely new option in the climate change response portfolio, at first glance promising insurance against fat-tail climate change risks. However, the persistent intrinsic uncertainties of RM suggest that any cautious climate risk management approach should consider RM as a complement to (rather than a substitute for) emission control at best. Moreover, the complexity of the earth system imposes major limitations on the ability of research to reduce these uncertainties. Thus we argue that a research strategy is needed that focuses on increasing our basic understanding of the earth system and conducting comprehensive assessments of the risk(s) associated with both climate change and the deployment of climate engineering.

TI  - Design and implementation of marine diesel engine exhaust emission reduction intelligent control system
AB  - With the worsening of the global environment and the strengthening of people's awareness of environmental protection, the air pollution caused by the exhaust emissions of marine diesel engines has attracted extensive attention from the international community. Because the exhaust post-treatment technology does not need to be reformed for diesel engine, and the quality requirement of fuel is relatively low, domestic and foreign research and development institutions all attach great importance to the research of exhaust post-treatment technology. By analyzing the mechanism and main chemical reaction of SCR reaction, the overall design scheme of marine diesel engine exhaust intelligent emission reduction control system was completed in order to reduce the nitrogen oxides and solid particles in the exhaust of marine diesel engine. According to TierIII emission regulation and marine diesel engine exhaust, the hardware structure design and model selection of marine diesel engine exhaust intelligent emission control system are completed. In order to ensure that the emission of the control system can meet the requirements of nitrogen oxide conversion rate and ammonia gas escape quantity at the same time, the corresponding model prediction algorithm is designed in this paper. Through the analysis of experimental results, it is proved that the control system established in this paper can well meet the emission requirements of TierIII regulations. The research content of this paper can be applied in the field of shipping to meet the requirements of TierIII regulations and prepare for more stringent emission regulations.

TI  - Promising bioactive compounds from the marine environment and their potential effects on various diseases
AB  - Background The marine environment hosts a wide variety of species that have evolved to live in harsh and challenging conditions. Marine organisms are the focus of interest due to their capacity to produce biotechnologically useful compounds. They are promising biocatalysts for new and sustainable industrial processes because of their resistance to temperature, pH, salt, and contaminants, representing an opportunity for several biotechnological applications. Encouraged by the extensive and richness of the marine environment, marine organisms' role in developing new therapeutic benefits is heading as an arable field. Main body of the abstract There is currently much interest in biologically active compounds derived from natural resources, especially compounds that can efficiently act on molecular targets, which are involved in various diseases. Studies are focused on bacteria and fungi, isolated from sediments, seawater, fish, algae, and most marine invertebrates such as sponges, mollusks, tunicates, coelenterates, and crustaceans. In addition to marine macro-organisms, such as sponges, algae, or corals, marine bacteria and fungi have been shown to produce novel secondary metabolites (SMs) with specific and intricate chemical structures that may hold the key to the production of novel drugs or leads. The marine environment is known as a rich source of chemical structures with numerous beneficial health effects. Presently, several lines of studies have provided insight into biological activities and neuroprotective effects of marine algae, including antioxidant, anti-neuroinflammatory, cholinesterase inhibitory activity, and neuronal death inhibition. Conclusion The application of marine-derived bioactive compounds has gained importance because of their therapeutic uses in several diseases. Marine natural products (MNPs) display various pharmaceutically significant bioactivities, including antibiotic, antiviral, neurodegenerative, anticancer, or anti-inflammatory properties. The present review focuses on the importance of critical marine bioactive compounds and their role in different diseases and highlights their possible contribution to humanity.

AB  - Cathelco has developed marine growth prevention systems (MGPS) for both cruise ships and large commercial vessels to safeguard pipework from bio-fouling. The system can treat large volumes of seawater, which blocks the pipework thereby restricting the flow of cooling water that led to engine overheating and increased fuel consumption. The system consists of a control panel feeding, an electrical current to pairs of anodes which are either mounted in the seachests or strainers and is based on the electrolytic principle. The company has received an order from the Vulcano yard in Spain where three 30200 dwt chemical tankers are being built for Russian owner Rosneft.

TI  - Mitigating climate change via CO2 sequestration into Biyadh reservoir: geomechanical modeling and caprock integrity
AB  - Excessive emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, can cause severe global climatic changes, which may include an increase in the global temperature, rise of the sea level, increase in wildfire, floods, and storms, in addition to changes in the amount of rain and snow. The global mitigation strategies that can be envisioned to reduce the release of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere include retrofitting buildings with more energy-efficient systems, increasing the dependency on renewable energy sources in lieu of fossil fuels, increasing the use of sustainable transportation systems that rely on electricity and biofuels, and adopting globally more sustainable uses of land and forests. To reduce global climatic changes, the excess amount of carbon dioxide in the environment needs to be captured and stored in deep underground sedimentary reservoirs. The sedimentary reservoirs that contain water in the rock matrix provide a more secure CO2 sequestration medium. The injection of carbon dioxide causes a huge increase in the reservoir pore pressure and provokes the subsequent ground uplift. The excessive increase in pore pressure may also cause leakage of carbon dioxide into the potable water layers and to the atmosphere, thus leading to severe global climatic changes. In order to maintain the integrity of the sequestration process, it is crucial to inject a safe quantity of carbon dioxide into the sequestration site. Accordingly, the injection period and the safe values of injection parameters, like flow rate and injection pressure, need to be calculated a priori to ensure that the stored carbon dioxide will not leak into the atmosphere and jeopardize the climate mitigation strategy. To model carbon dioxide injection in reservoirs having a base fluid, such as water, one has to perform a two-phase flow modeling for both the injected and base fluids. In the present investigation, carbon dioxide is injected into Biyadh reservoir, wherein the two-phase flow through the reservoir structure is taken into account. This investigation aims to estimate the safe parameter values for carbon dioxide injection into the Biyadh reservoir, in order to avoid leakage of carbon dioxide through the caprock. In this context, the two cases of a fractured and non-fractured caprock are considered. To ensure a safe sequestration mechanism, the coupled reservoir stability analysis is performed to estimate the safe values of the injection parameters, thus furnishing data for a reliable global climate change mitigation strategy. The obtained results demonstrated that the injection of carbon dioxide has caused a maximum pore pressure increase of 25MPa and a ground uplift of 35mm.

TI  - New Cable Systems for Offshore Wind Power Plants
AB  - In this chapter, the grid connection of large-scale wind power plants or wind power plant clusters by means of high phase order transmission systems, or more profoundly bipolar HVAC cable systems is explained. In this HVAC bipolar system, the phase order is increased by appropriate transformer groups from three phases to either four or six phases. After a short description of these transformer groups, submarine cables for the bipolar transmission system are explained. Beside single-core submarine cables, a new cable type with four cable-cores is described. After the global description, application examples for bipolar HVAC offshore transmission systems are given. As the last part of the transmission chain, bipolar land cable systems are analysed with respect to their current rating as well as the magnetic inductions, also in comparison to three-phase cable systems.

TI  - Mexicoâ€™s shoreline as a site for the transition to renewable energy
AB  - Mexico has an abundant supply of unexploited renewable energy resources. As a significant percentage of the countryâ€™s income is based on the extraction of petroleum and fossil fuels, the transition to cleaner energy has been impeded. Consequently, the investment in â€“ and application of â€“ green power is also minimal. The hurdles preventing the change from oil to renewable energy are summarized in this paper. A major impediment to the development of renewable energy is the statutory monopoly on power generation and distribution, deterring independent producers of electricity. To move Mexico forward, this and other barriers must be removed. One possible action is to improve the Mexican shoreline for tourism, and along this line, the proper use of offshore renewable energy is particularly appealing. Â© 2014, Â© 2014 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Engineering Vibrio sp. SP1 for the production of carotenoids directly from brown macroalgae
AB  - Macroalgae is regarded as a promising third-generation marine biomass that can be utilized as a sustainable feedstock for bio-industry due to the high sugar level and absence of lignin. Alginate, composed of 1,4-linked D-mannuronate (M) and L-guluronate (G), is one of the major carbohydrates in brown macroalgae. It is difficult to be assimilated by most industrial microorganisms. Therefore, developing engineered microorganisms that can utilize alginate as a feedstock in order to produce natural products from marine biomass is critical. In this study, we isolated, characterized, and sequenced Vibrio sp. SP1 which rapidly grows using alginate as a sole carbon source. We further engineered this strain by introducing genes encoding enzymes under the control of synthetic expression cassettes to produce lycopene and beta-carotene which are attractive phytochemicals owing to the antioxidant property. We confirmed that the engineered Vibrio sp. SP1 could successfully produce 2.13 +/- 0.37 mg L-1 of lycopene, 2.98 +/- 0. 43 mg L-1 of beta-carotene, respectively, from 10 g L-1 of alginate as a sole carbon source. Furthermore, our engineered strain could directly convert 60 g L-1 of brown macroalgae Sargassum fusiforme into 1.23 +/- 0.21 mg L-1 of lycopene without any pretreatment which had been vitally required for the previous productions. As the first demonstrated strain to produce high-value product from Sargassum, Vibrio sp. SP1 is evaluated to be a desirable platform for the brown macroalgae-based biorefinery.

TI  - Sustainable Marine Aquaponics: Effects of Shrimp to Plant Ratios and C/N Ratios
AB  - Integrated aquaponic food production systems are capable of producing more food on less land using less water than conventional food systems, and marine systems offer the potential of conserving freshwater resources. However, there have been few evaluations of species combinations or operational parameters in marine aquaponics. The goal of this experiment was evaluation of stocking density ratio of Pacific whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) to three edible halophytes (Atriplex hortensis, Salsola komarovii, and Plantago coronopus) with two C/N ratios in a 3 x 2 factorial design. There were three stocking density ratios (shrimp: plant), 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1; and two C/N ratios, 12 and 15. The results indicated that stocking density ratio exerted a significant impact on shrimp growth. Shrimp reared in 2:1 and 3:1 treatments had better growth performance. In contrast, plants were affected by both stocking density ratio and C/N ratio. Halophytes grown in stocking density ratios of 3:1 and 5:1 with a C/N ratio of 15 had better growth performance and nutrient content. The concentrations of TAN and NO2- were below 0.2 mg/L throughout the experiment, including the higher stocking density ratio treatments. In conclusion, the stocking density ratio of 3:1 with a C/N ratio of 15 was suggested as the optimal condition for the operation of marine aquaponics in which whiteleg shrimp and the three halophytes are target crops.

TI  - A comprehensive review on CO2/N2 mixture injection for methane gas recovery in hydrate reservoirs
AB  - Clathrate hydrates are non-stoichiometric compounds of water and gas molecules coexisting at relatively low temperatures and high pressures. The gas molecules are trapped in cage-like structures of the water molecules by hydrogen bonds. There are several hydrate deposits in permafrost and oceanic sediments with an enormous amount of energy. The energy content of methane in hydrate reservoirs is considered to be up to 50 times that of conventional petroleum resources, with about 2,500 to 20,000 trillion m3 of methane gas. More than 220 hydrate deposits in permafrost and oceanic sediments have been identified to date. The exploration and production of these deposits to recover the trapped methane gas could overcome the world energy challenges and create a sustainable energy future. Furthermore, global warming is a major issue facing the world at large and it is caused by greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide. As a result, researchers and organizations have proposed various methods of reducing the emission of carbon dioxide gas. One of the proposed methods is the geological storage of carbon dioxide in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, oceanic sediments, deep saline aquifers, and depleted hydrate deposits. Studies have shown that there is the possibility of methane gas production and carbon dioxide storage in hydrate reservoirs using the injection of carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas mixture. However, the conventional hydrocarbon production methods cannot be used for the hydrate reservoirs due to the nature of these reservoirs. In addition, thermal stimulation and depressurization are not effective methods for methane gas production and carbon sequestration in hydrate-bearing sediments. Therefore, the gas replacement method for methane production and carbon dioxide storage in clathrate hydrate is investigated in this paper. The research studies (experiments, modeling/simulation, and field tests) on CO2/N2 gas mixture injection for the optimization of methane gas recovery in hydrate reservoirs are reviewed. It was discovered that the injection of the gas mixture enhanced the recovery process by replacing methane gas in the small and large cages of the hydrate. Also, the presence of N2 molecules significantly increased fluid injectivity and methane recovery rate. In addition, a significant amount of free water was not released and the hydrate phase was stable during the replacement process. It is an effective method for permanent storage of carbon dioxide in the hydrate layer. However, further research studies on the effects of gas composition, particle size, and gas transport on the replacement process and swapping rate are required.

TI  - Feasibility of Underwater Sensor Networks for Lifetime Assessment of Offshore Civil Structures
AB  - Recently, large-scale underwater ad-hoc networks and underwater sensor networks have drawn significant attention to explore vast possibilities in oceans. Many potential applications are possible using underwater sensor networks including biological habitat monitoring, energy harvesting and environmental monitoring. However, research on underwater structural monitoring has been limited. The focus of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of underwater sensor networks for offshore and deep-sea structural monitoring. In this paper, the network communication topology and in-network processing algorithm for two offshore wind farms, the Middelgrunden and Horn Revs offshore wind farms in Denmark, are considered based on numerical simulation using Aqua-Sim (an underwater simulation tool) for developing underwater sensor networks. An evaluation of a laboratory-scale water basin network experiments that make use of Aqua-Lab at University of Connecticut will be provided with possible future development for underwater civil infrastructure monitoring.

TI  - Evaluating, predicting and mapping belowground carbon stores in Kenyan mangroves
AB  - Despite covering only approximately 138 000 km(2), mangroves are globally important carbon sinks with carbon density values three to four times that of terrestrial forests. A key challenge in evaluating the carbon benefits from mangrove forest conservation is the lack of rigorous spatially resolved estimates of mangrove sediment carbon stocks; most mangrove carbon is stored belowground. Previous work has focused on detailed estimations of carbon stores over relatively small areas, which has obvious limitations in terms of generality and scope of application. Most studies have focused only on quantifying the top 1 m of belowground carbon (BGC). Carbon stored at depths beyond 1 m, and the effects of mangrove species, location and environmental context on these stores, are poorly studied. This study investigated these variables at two sites (Gazi and Vanga in the south of Kenya) and used the data to produce a country-specific BGC predictive model for Kenya and map BGC store estimates throughout Kenya at spatial scales relevant for climate change research, forest management and REDD+ (reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation). The results revealed that mangrove species was the most reliable predictor of BGC; Rhizophora muronata had the highest mean BGC with 1485.5 t C ha(-1). Applying the species-based predictive model to a base map of species distribution in Kenya for the year 2010 with a 2.5 m(2) resolution produced an estimate of 69.41 Mt C [}+/- 9.15 95\% confidence interval (C.I.)] for BGC in Kenyan mangroves. When applied to a 1992 mangrove distribution map, the BGC estimate was 75.65 Mt C (+/- 12.21 95\% C.I.), an 8.3\% loss in BGC stores between 1992 and 2010 in Kenya. The country-level mangrove map provides a valuable tool for assessing carbon stocks and visualizing the distribution of BGC. Estimates at the 2.5 m(2) resolution provide sufficient details for highlighting and prioritizing areas for mangrove conservation and restoration.

TI  - Performance evaluation and environment risk assessment of steel slag enhancement for seawater to capture CO2
AB  - Major CO2 emitters are concentrated in coastal areas of China. The seawater with potential to capture CO2 was used as an absorbent and the addition of steel slag (SS) enhanced CO2 absorption by seawater. CO2 solubility in steel-slag-enhanced seawater was measured by an on-line chromatography apparatus, and the characterization analysis, thermodynamics, and kinetics were researched. CO2 solubility in seawater with a steel slag of 1.00 wt\% increases by 64.27\% relative to that in seawater, but is smaller than that in simulated-steel-slag-seawater (increasing by 29.86\% relative to that in seawater with real steel slag). The results of XRD, TGA, IR and SEM-EDS show that Ca(OH)(2) in the steel slag reacts with CO2 to form CaCO3. More quantity of CaO in simulated steel slag reacted with CO2 compared to real steel slag from XRF analysis. Increasing the concentration of steel slag and decreasing particle size of steel slag can also improve CO2 solubility and CO2 absorption rate. The steel slag and products after capturing CO2 are not hazardous waste and the steel slag can operate the solidification/stabilization of toxic metals. Steel slag can enhance CO2 absorption by seawater and perennially segregate CO2, providing CO2 capture and storage for coastal zones. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mind the gap in the GAIRS: The role of other instruments in LOSC regime implementation in the offshore energy sector
AB  - While the international legal framework for offshore energy activities is anchored in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC), it "is complemented by an array of relevant instruments and measures at the global, regional and national levels". This chapter examines the role of generally accepted international rules and standards (GAIRS) in the implementation of the LOSC in the offshore energy sector, with particular reference to the decommissioning of offshore installations, marine pollution from continental shelf exploration and exploitation, submarine cables and pipelines, and shipping. This analysis reveals that this role has been one of facilitating, strengthening and updating the LOSC in the light of legal and technical developments since its conclusion-a process of normative reinforcement rather than normative conflict. Yet, as highlighted in the conclusion, significant gaps nonetheless remain in the regulation of offshore energy activities. Â© 2015 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.

TI  - Optimization of cycle and expander design of an organic rankine cycle unit using multi-component working fluids
AB  - Organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems represent attractive solutions for power conversion from low temperature heat sources, and the use of these power systems is gaining increasing attention in the marine industry. This paper proposes the combined optimal design of cycle and expander for an organic Rankine cycle unit utilizing waste heat from low temperature heat sources. The study addresses a case where the minimum temperature of the heat source is constrained and a case where no constraint is imposed. The former case is the waste heat recovery from jacket cooling water of a marine diesel engine onboard a large ship, and the latter is representative of a low-Temperature geothermal, solar or waste heat recovery application. Multi-component working fluids are investigated, as they allow improving the match between the temperature profiles in the heat exchangers and, consequently, reducing the irreversibility in the ORC system. This work considers mixtures of R245fa/pentane and propane/isobutane. The use of multicomponent working fluids typically results in increased heat transfer areas and different expander designs compared to pure fluids. In order to properly account for turbine performance and design constraints in the cycle calculation, the thermodynamic cycle and the turbine are optimized simultaneously in the molar composition range of each mixture. Such novel optimization approach enables one to identify to which extent the cycle or the turbine behaviour influences the selection of the optimal solution. It also enables one to find the composition for which an optimal compromise between cycle and turbine performance is achieved. The optimal ORC unit employs pure R245fa and provides approximately 200 kW when the minimum hot fluid temperature is constrained. Conversely, the mixture R245fa/pentane (0.5/0.5) is selected and provides approximately 444 kW when the hot fluid temperature is not constrained to a lower value. In both cases, a compact and efficient turbine can be manufactured. Copyright Â© 2016 by ASME.

TI  - Unlocking the deepwater natural gas hydrate's commercial potential with extended reach wells from shallow water: Review and an innovative method
AB  - Deepwater natural gas hydrate (NGH) is generally accepted as a promising energy source for humanity in the coming future due to its huge amount of available reserves on earth. However, as deepwater NGH reservoirs always have restricted accessibility, harsh engineering conditions and high operation risk, their development has been considered technically and economically less viable. Worldwide field production tests have indicated that the current techniques are not able to commercially develop deepwater NGH independently. Therefore, technological revolutions for deepwater NGH development is pressing to unlock deepwater NGH's commercial potential. The purpose of this work is twofold. First, the state-of-art research on the NGH reservoirs development and extended reach wells (ERWs) technology are comprehensively reviewed. In addition to summarize the previous research achievements, the limitations and insightful suggestions are put forward for future deepwater NGH development. Second, inspired by the development of ERWs technology and its great success in maximum depletion of the offshore unconventional oil \& gas reservoirs, an innovative method for unlocking the deepwater NGH's commercial potential with ERWs from shallow water is proposed. With the benefits of improving the deepwater NGH reservoirs drainage, taking full advantage of the formation geothermal heat beneath shallow water, combining depressurization with the thermal simulation technique though linking the deepwater NGH reservoirs with multiple free gas deposits in shallower water with a single wellbore, getting free of engineering and geological risks in deepwater, minimizing the cost and environmental footprint, the innovative method may promote the commercial viability of deepwater NGH development and trigger the next boom in the unconventional oil \& gas development after shale gas.

TI  - Exergy assessment and energy integration of advanced gas turbine cycles on an offshore petroleum production platform
AB  - On offshore platform applications, power and heat are normally supplied by simple open cycle gas turbine (OCGT) and heat recovery steam generators (HRSG) at lower efficiencies if compared to onshore combined cycle systems. Certainly, due to the reduced available space and the weight constraints, combined cycles are not commonly considered as cogeneration systems on conventional offshore petroleum platforms. However, more stringent environmental policies for the natural gas and oil production activities have motivated the integration assessment of advanced technological solutions that aim to mitigate the environmental impact that conventional offshore platforms are responsible for. Accordingly, in this paper, the effect of the integration of a low emission, oxyfuel gas turbine cycle is analyzed and compared against an amines-based post-combustion system and a conventional offshore petroleum platform operation in terms of its exergy efficiency and reduced atmospheric CO2 emissions. Indeed, although the conventional configuration is the most efficient, the oxyfuel powered platform configuration presents close power cycle efficiency of 27.10\% and the lowest specific CO2 emissions of 0.014 kg(co2)/t(oil), whereas the amines-based layout provides the best cogeneration efficiency (55.34\%) of the advanced configurations. Moreover, an energy integration analysis is performed to identify the heat recovery potential, while the exergy method is used to evaluate and quantify the most critical components that lead to the largest irreversibilities along the primary separation, cogeneration and gas compression systems. As a result, the study points to ways of decarbonizing offshore applications in the oil and gas sector.

TI  - Jack-St. Malo marine operator training simulator
AB  - A Marine Simulator was developed for the Jack-St. Malo field located in approximately 7000 feet of water in the Gulf of Mexico Walker Ridge block. The simulator presented operational information in a form similar to that on the actual facility and provided operational personnel with extensive operational experience and training on scenarios as may be faced in the actual facility, prior to and subsequent to facility start-up. The design of the ballast system for this Semi-Submersible Floating Production Unit (FPU) called for a comprehensive training procedure as an added operational safety measure for the marine operators. The Jack-St. Malo Marine Simulator utilizes process and safety control configurations that are the same as the facility. It includes a Load Management system and an Environment and Facilities Monitoring System (EFMS) integrated with a high fidelity dynamic model for the hull ballast and bilge systems. The simulator proved to be an effective tool to perform Control System checkout during precommissioning. Lifts for production, generation and compression modules were first tested on the Marine Simulator before actual lifts were conducted in the yard. Naval architects were consulted to verify anticipated ballasting operations before actual operations. The simulator gave operators a feel of the Process Dynamics, Process Control, and Safety System and familiarity with the Operator Station graphics well before start up. The simulator was successfully used as a dummy platform along with the Load Management Advisory Program to demonstrate the ballast procedure for the successive installation of three heavy modules onboard the actual platform. Scenarios simulated include hurricane shutdown and start-up, instrument failures, damaged mooring line situations and damaged compartment scenarios due to collision or inadvertent flooding, among many others. Operator training to operate Jack-St. Malo ballast and bilge systems using facility Operator graphics and control system was thoroughly carried out using this Simulator and this contributed to the high level of confidence in hull commissioning operations including lifts and ballasting operations. The simulator was a useful tool for validating Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) before actual facility start-up. Copyright 2014, Offshore Technology Conference.

While the long-range and extended durability capabilities of the Wave Glider have allowed users to make oceanographic and scientific measurements across nearly every expanse of the sea surface, those measurements have, outside of various acoustic signals, been limited to the top 10-20m of the ocean. In order to extend the capabilities of the system, Liquid Robotics developed a winch, allowing physical measurements at much greater depths and opening up a new dimension in autonomous surface vehicle data acquisition.

TI  - Development and engineering of offshore mining systems - State of the art and future perspectives
AB  - This paper gives a brief overview on the major milestones of the deep sea mining projects in the 70's and 80's with focus on the OMI/OMCO-Consortia and the engineering milestones SEDCO 445, Hughes Glomar Explorer, Clementine II and PLA2 6000, the pilot mining tests of the AMR, the environmental study DISCOL and the joint efforts of Gemenod/Preussag. Among the most interesting and technologically challenging systems are those for deep sea mining of manganese nodules in water depths of 4,000 to 6,000 meters in the Mid-Pacific. Following the total integrated systems (TIS) approach, the technology transfer between ultra-deep water drilling and deep sea mining is outlined based on several subsystems and specified for the key components of the vertical transport system. As example for state of the art engineering and technologies recent developments of heavy-load active heave compensated drawworks, ultra-deep water riser systems, motion-compensated offshore mining drill pipes with air-lift slurry transport, remote subsea workclass-crawler ISUP and the Korean manganese nodules collector MineRo II are described. Based on the principles applied for development and engineering of systems for shallow water offshore mining and the experiences available from the pilot mining tests conducted in the past, a concept for an offshore mining system was developed by MHWirth in corporation with the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR). This concept will be outlined in the current paper together with the main results of an economic feasibility study. Furthermore, an overview on the current European deep sea mining research projects and a renewed German-French industrial cooperation is given. Synergies with the emerging private space industry are anticipated regarding systems engineering. Future perspectives for a new pilot mining test are discussed.

TI  - Desalination plant profile: Aruba: the pearl of the Caribbean
AB  - The Caribbean island of Aruba is building a new 24,000 m 3/day desalination facility to process seawater from beach wells. This desalination project, which is being performed on a 22-month schedule, will use the latest reverse osmosis (RO) technology to replace the island's existing thermal desalination units. The contract was issued by Water en Energiebedrijf Aruba N.V., the island's electric and water utility. Five prospective firms had been shortlisted for the project based on initial indicative pricing. The new plant will provide the island community with a more efficient treatment process and enable Aruba to phase out its older desalination units. The goal with the new desalination plant is to maintain the online availability throughout the life of the facility, while achieving an economical cost of water. Seawater will go through three main processes at Aruba's new desalination plant, pre-treatment, RO, and post-treatment, prior to delivery to the island's potable water distribution system.

TI  - Un-manned minimal floating platforms
AB  - A normally un-manned minimal floating platform can be used for several applications to support subsea development. The applications include enabling Long Subsea Tiebacks by supporting power generation and distribution equipment, when the host facility doesn't have excess power capacity (Power Buoy) or the required footprint and space to support the required power distribution hardware or locate the distribution equipment to distribute the power imported from shore. It can also serve as a partial processing host with functionality ranging from Chemicals and Artificial Lift all the way to Multi-Phase Pumping or Gas Compression, as required. An un-manned floating platform can be a cost-efficient solution, where the economics of a very Long Subsea Tieback or a Host Facility with full processing capacity become prohibitive for developing small to medium size fields. The substructures for these platforms have reduced and simplified systems resulting in lower Capex, Opex and minimal maintenance requirements. This platform is safer to operate than conventional host platforms because it is un-manned, and it also deploys robotics and remotely controlled equipment, using the latest advances in digital, robotics, and autonomous control technologies. The paper reviews the different floating unmanned minimal platform configurations that are designed for this purpose. The following aspects of the normally un-manned floating platform are discussed: â€¢ Functionality â€¢ Cost-Efficient Design alternatives â€¢ Construction/Installation efficiency â€¢ Operations/ Maintenance principles Possible applications of the normally un-manned floating platform include small to medium size fields, remote gas fields requiring compression to export gas to shore that would otherwise prove to be un-economical to develop. The normally un-manned floating platform helps improve the development economics and the operational safety of these fields. The industry's response to the oil price slump in the past few years combined with the latest advances in technology led to the evolution of these minimal unmanned floating platforms.

TI  - Sustainable transport by use of alternative marine and aviation fuelsâ€”A well-to-tank analysis to assess interactions with Singapore's energy system
AB  - Sustainable economic development and renewable energy carriers are challenges facing hub cities that will influence their future role in trade and transport. The objective of this paper is to discuss the interactions between alternative transport fuels for international applications and Singapore's energy system as a central hub of global transport. The process chains for the supply of conventional fuels, liquefied natural gas, biofuels, and liquid hydrogen in Singapore are analysed by applying a well-to-tank analysis, following which the energy demand and the associated greenhouse gas emissions are calculated. A sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the individual impacts of various processes. A comparison of process chains for the supply of fuels for marine and aviation purposes shows that conventional energy carriers and liquefied natural gas achieve higher energy efficiencies than biofuels and liquid hydrogen. Alternative fuels reduce greenhouse gas emissions by varying degrees depending on the fuel type. An analysis of interactions with Singapore's energy system identifies emerging opportunities and challenges for the city-state's economic system associated with future development of international transport. Although alternative fuels offer the possibility of diversifying Singapore's energy supply, creating new business opportunities, and increasing Singapore's impact on fighting climate change, limited resource potentials and higher energy prices set new challenges to secure Singapore's role as an international trade and transport hub.

TI  - Solid material captures CO2 at the wellhead
AB  - Chemists at Rice University developed a new carbon-based solid material that can capture CO2 from natural gas at source at ambient temperature, and releases it as the pressure is reduced. Natural gas is in many places composed of 10-20% CO2, which must be removed before it can be used. This is done at remote gas processing stations, using large towers containing aqueous amine. The aqueous amine is corrosive and must be heated to 140Â°C to release the CO2. Not only is this process energy-intensive, but the remote locations of the processing stations often mean that there is no convenient way of dealing with the captured CO2, so it is often just vented into the atmosphere, adding to the carbon footprint of gas production. The material can be used at the pressures found at the wellhead, without any further energy input to release the CO2. The captured CO2 can simply be pumped straight back underground into the well for storage or EOR. This will be especially effective offshore, where the footprints of traditional methods that involve scrubbing towers or membranes are too cumbersome. The black powder material is a nanoporous solid of carbon with either nitrogen or sulfur. It is made by heating an inexpensive polymer with a base, such as potassium hydroxide, to 600Â°C.

TI  - Investigation of causes of errors in numerical prediction to specify CO2 seepage information in the ocean
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is one of the important solutions against the increase of CO2 emission in the world. Especially, technology of CO2 storage under the seafloor gathers attentions and is promoted to reach on practical stage until 2020 in Japan. In this study, we developed the estimation method to specify the leakage information such like location and time for leakage accident. Our method is derived from adjoint marginal sensitivity method. We conducted test calculation with the two type release situation (momentum and continuous release) and evaluated the error and factor. Â© 2016 IEEE.

TI  - Time domain structural fatigue analysis of floating offshore platforms: A response based technique
AB  - This paper presents a response-based, time-domain structural fatigue analysis of a floating offshore platform. The conventional technique for structural fatigue assessments of offshore platforms uses a linear, frequency-domain analysis based on the spectral method. Although this conventional method is computationally efficient, there is a room for improving accuracy and reducing uncertainties because it cannot accurately address non-linear loadings on the offshore platform. Such non-linear loads arise from the wave, wind, and current as well as from the riser and mooring systems; these non-linearities necessitate large factors of safety that lead to conservative design and frequent inspection. As an extension of previous work (Kyoung et al.[12]), this study presents the development of a time-domain, structural fatigue analysis that explicitly addresses non-linear loading on the platform. The external load time-histories are directly mapped onto the structure at every time interval to create a stress-based response with the varying environment. In each time step, the load mapping accurately captures the phase relationship between the external loading and hull inertial response. Therefore, present method reduces uncertainties in the fatigue damage computation and overcomes the assumptions of spectral method. Present load component-based approach is applied onto a finite element structural model, which provides unit structural response at locations of interest. Time history of structural response is obtained by synthesizing the obtained unit stress-based structural response with environmental loading and platform motion response. Fatigue damage can be computed from the obtained time series of structural response using rainflow counting. As an application, a conventional semisubmersible platform is used to evaluate structural fatigue damage for a given wave scatter diagram. A comparison between results from this response-based time-domain approach and the conventional spectral method is presented. Copyright Â© 2020 ASME

TI  - Utilization of the cyanobacteria Anabaena sp. CH1 in biological carbon dioxide mitigation processes
AB  - Before switching totally to alternative fuel stage, CO2 mitigation process has considered a transitional strategy for combustion of fossil fuels inevitably. In comparison to other CO2 mitigation options, such as oceanic or geologic injection, the biological photosynthetic process would present a far superior and sustainable solution under both environmental and social considerations. The utilization of the cyanobacteria Anabaena sp. CH1 in carbon dioxide mitigation processes is analyzed in our research. It was found that an original developed photobioreactor with internal light source exhibits high light utilization. Anabaena sp. CH1 demonstrates excellent CO2 tolerance even at 15% CO2 level. This enables flue gas from power plant to be directly introduced to Anabaena sp. CH1 culture. Double light intensity and increased 47% CO2 bubble retention time could enhance CO2 removal efficiencies by 79% and 67%, respectively. A maximum CO2 fixation rate of 1.01g CO2L-1day-1 was measured experimentally. Â© 2011.

TI  - Performance analysis of offshore solar power plants
AB  - Large flat land surfaces, where direct normal irradiance (DNI) is high enough for concentrating solar power (CSP), are scarce in Europe. Floating offshore solar power plants in the Mediterranean Sea could increase the European solar power resources significantly. In this paper a solar collector platform design is investigated, where individual platform segments are supported by several air chambers, which are formed by cylindrical flexible membrane skirts. This paper is focused on the optical performance of the collector platform which is simulated in a dynamic model. Two types of concentrators are considered: (1) Parabolic Trough Collectors and (2) Pneumatic Pre-Stressed Solar Concentrators. From experimental data gained from a 4Ã—4 m physical model, we have obtained the general characteristics of the platform. Using wave data of the Mediterranean Sea, the motion of the platform in different sea states is calculated. The dependency of the concentrator system on the angle of incident, which is in this case also a function of the platform motion due to ocean waves, is obtained from ray tracing. Solar irradiance is derived from satellite data and also included in the model. Combining all these data in one dynamic model, the achievable optical performance of a floating offshore solar power plant is calculated as a function of time and location. Â© 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Concerns and solutions for interfacing fracturing and sand control completion strategies into multilateral technology
AB  - Multilateral technology offers the oilfield a completion system that mechanically connects one or more lateral wellbores to a parent wellbore and allows selective or commingled production. These capabilities usually provide more cost-effective well construction since reservoir exposure from one wellbore is increased. In offshore and deepwater environments where slot and/or sub-sea templates are limited and rig costs substantially higher, these advantages are even more beneficial. Because of the flexibility of this technique and its capability to offer various production options, it helps to mitigate the risks previously associated with directional/horizontal wells in new field developments as well as in revitalization of mature fields. Continual improvement in drilling techniques and the increase in the number of field successes using multilateral technology have continued to increase its popularity; however, as with all completion techniques, it must be remembered that existing completion options must be evaluated for each case, and if needed, adapted to meet specific reservoir objectives and concerns. This paper will focus on interfacing sand-control fracturing stimulation with multilateral technology. The techniques targeted include existing, modified, and conceptual completion methods that can be deployed into multilateral field-development strategies. The strategies address window selection, junction isolation, fluid loss, debris management, and lateral accessibility considerations along with the applications, and benefits of specific tool configurations recently developed. Several completion sequences, which include a new Technology Advancement for Multi-Lateral (TAML) level 4 single-trip, gravel-pack methods and installation of expandable screen technology, will also be presented.

TI  - Organic carbon stabilization mechanisms in mangrove soils: A review
AB  - Despite the recognized organic carbon (OC) sequestration potential of mangrove forests, the ongoing climate change and anthropogenic disturbances pose a great threat to these ecosystems. However, we currently lack the ability to mechanically understand and predict the consequences of such impacts, primarily because mechanisms underlying OC stabilization in these ecosystems remain elusive. Research into OC stabilization has focused on terrestrial soils and marine sediments for decades, overlooking the vegetated coastal ecosystems including mangroves. In terrestrial soils and marine sediments, it is widely accepted that OC stabilization is the integrated consequence of OM's inherent recalcitrance, physical protection, and interactions with minerals and metals. However, related discussion is rarely done in mangrove soils, and recalcitrance of roots and high net ecosystem production (high primary production and low heterotrophic respiration) have been considered as a primary OC sequestration mechanism in mangrove peat and mineral soils, respectively. This review presents the available information on the mechanisms underlying OC stabilization in mangrove soils and highlights research questions that warrant further investigation. Primary OC stabilization mechanisms differ between mangrove peat and mineral soils. In mangrove mineral soils, physico-chemical stabilization processes are important, yet grossly understudied OC stabilization mechanisms. In mangrove peat, recalcitrance of mangrove roots and the inhibition of phenoloxidase under the anoxic condition may be the primary OC stabilization mechanisms. Salinity-induced OC immobilization likely plays a role in both type of soils. Finally, this review argues that belowground production and allochthonous inputs in mangrove forests are likely underestimated. More studies are needed to constrain C budgets to explain the enigma that mangrove OC keeps accumulating despite much higher decomposition (especially by large lateral exports) than previously considered.

TI  - High efficiency EOR and IOR technology on in-situ CO2 generation
AB  - Enhanced oil recovery by injecting carbon dioxide CO2 as a tertiary hydrocarbon recovery mechanism under the water flooding is one of the ways to improve oil recovery, extend the oil field life and increase the efficiency of the oil field development in general. Despite the significant advantages of CO2 injection the risks associated with capturing, transportation and storage of carbon dioxide significantly reduce the possibility of its application in EOR and IOR processes. In this paper we present the results of longstanding experimental, theoretical and field research on the development and wide implementation of high-technology industrial method of in-situ generation of CO2 gas-liquid slug has been shown. This process provides effectively regulation of the dynamic processes during oil displacement. Adjustability of gas generation dynamics of gas by controlling of carbon dioxide phase state, depending on the mineralization of water-based reactive agents under reservoir conditions. Laboratory tests demonstrate the technology efficiency in the processes of oil displacement on the core models. As a result of the widespread implementation of the technology on the oil fields of TNK, LUKOIL, SLAVNEFT (Russian Federation); SOCAR (Azerbaijan); Sinopec, CNOOC and PETROCHINA (China); GTT (United States, Oklahoma) significant results of additional oil recovery and increasing of oil recovery factor has been achieved. First developed technology of residual oil recovery by the water flooding based on the in-situ formation of carbon dioxide under the process of sequential injection gas generating chemicals. Technology provides the implementation of gas generation process on the on-shore and off-shore development of oil fields. Efficiency and economic profitability of technology is determined by the special conditions of the gas-liquid creation slug no need to find industrial volumes of CO2 sources and of pipeline infrastructure construction; making operations in remote areas, oil and gas regions with complicated climatic conditions; no need to build additional communications and power supply for CO2 injection.

TI  - Seaweed fails to prevent ocean acidification impact on foraminifera along a shallow-water CO2 gradient
AB  - Ocean acidification causes biodiversity loss, alters ecosystems, and may impact food security, as shells of small organisms dissolve easily in corrosive waters. There is a suggestion that photosynthetic organisms could mitigate ocean acidification on a local scale, through seagrass protection or seaweed cultivation, as net ecosystem organic production raises the saturation state of calcium carbonate making seawater less corrosive. Here, we used a natural gradient in calcium carbonate saturation, caused by shallow-water CO2 seeps in the Mediterranean Sea, to assess whether seaweed that is resistant to acidification (Padina pavonica) could prevent adverse effects of acidification on epiphytic foraminifera. We found a reduction in the number of species of foraminifera as calcium carbonate saturation state fell and that the assemblage shifted from one dominated by calcareous species at reference sites (pH similar to 8.19) to one dominated by agglutinated foraminifera at elevated levels of CO2 (pH similar to 7.71). It is expected that ocean acidification will result in changes in foraminiferal assemblage composition and agglutinated forms may become more prevalent. Although Padina did not prevent adverse effects of ocean acidification, high biomass stands of seagrass or seaweed farms might be more successful in protecting epiphytic foraminifera.

TI  - Effects of pneumatophore density on methane emissions in mangroves
AB  - Mangroves play an important role in carbon sequestration. However, mangroves can be sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study, methane (CH4 ) emissions and related soil properties were determined in multiple mangroves in Taiwan, including Kandelia obovata and Avicennia marina mangroves. K. obovata possess prop roots, whereas pneumatophores are found in A. marina. Our results showed that mangrove soils were significant sources of CH4 emissions, which should be accounted for in mangrove carbon budgets. In particular, CH4 emissions in the A. marina mangroves were approximately 50-to 100-fold those of the K. obovata mangroves and the adjoining mudflats. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the soil salinity and pH in K. obovata mangroves and the soil redox potential and organic content in the mudflats were the key factors affecting CH4 emissions. However, the pneumatophore density alone explained approximately 48% of the variation in CH4 emissions in the A. marina mangroves. More pneumatophores resulted in higher CH4 emissions in the A. marina mangroves. Thus, compared with the assessed soil properties, the contribution of pneumatophores to the transportation of CH4 from soil was more significant. In addition to soil properties, our results demonstrated that the root structure may also affect GHG emissions from mangroves. Â© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - A Novel Big Data Collection System for Ship Energy Efficiency Monitoring and Analysis Based on BeiDou System
AB  - The call for green shipping is increasing, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships becomes more and more important. Traditional ship energy efficiency monitoring is based on the noon reports, which are susceptible to human error and have a time delay. Many ship energy efficiency monitoring systems have been designed and developed, but they usually cannot send data to the shore in time. In order to identify abnormal fuel consumption in time, this paper realizes a big data collection system for ship energy efficiency monitoring based on the BeiDou System. The system installed on two sister container ships has already collected a lot of data. Big data analysis methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis, are applied in the system to realize data visualization and analysis. Using PCA, it turns out that the shaft power of the main engine is related to a certain ship speed, which is also affected by load and weather conditions, and is the biggest factor in determining fuel consumption. To realize the assessment of hull fouling and the optimization of ship trim, a useful physics-based analysis is proposed. The analysis shows that the fouling of ship body greatly increases its resistance. Our analysis method can also find the best trim under specific loading condition. All these points are important for reducing fuel consumption and improving ship efficiency.

TI  - Development of an efficient coal-fueled solid oxide fuel cell power system concept equipped for CO2 separation
AB  - A baseline, clean, coal-fueled, high-efficiency, fuel cell-based electric power system concept has been developed as part of U.S. Department of Energy contract no. DEFC26-05NT4261 3. Key system design objectives were high electric efficiency with CO2 separation at a plant capacity greater than 100 MWe. The efficiency was to be greater than 50% (net AC/coal HHV) and it was required that at least 90% of the carbon exiting the coal gasification system in syngas must be separated (in CO2 form), ready for sequestration. The selected baseline power system cycle concept integrates pressurized SOFC generator modules with a gas turbine and a steam turbine bottoming cycle. To maximize the system electric efficiency, a high degree of subsystem heat integration is employed. CO2 separation from syngas is accomplished prior to utilization by power generation components. The power system cycle concept is described, major system components are identified and characterized, the component physical arrangement is discussed, and results of the system electric performance and conceptual-level cost evaluations are presented. A power system proof-of-concept demonstration is planned at a capacity level of approximately 5 MWe.

TI  - CO2 reduction strategies for the Northern Netherlands
AB  - The concern about global warming initiated ambitious CO2 reduction goals in cities and regions in the Netherlands. This article describes a study of such a local initiative for the Northern Netherlands. The research aimed to develop CO2 reduction scenarios for 2035 with national and international politics, and regional goals and opportunities being integrated. The scenarios were calculated using a bottom-up model. Four scenarios were developed with a defined goal of a 50\% CO2 reduction on the starting year (2000). The four scenarios were developed along two axes: centralized versus decentralized energy supply systems, and international climate policy versus a European-oriented energy policy. Primary energy consumption varied between 273 and 443PJ. Although 50\% CO2 reduction is possible in all scenarios, an enormous effort would be required to reach this goal. Depending on the scenario: an almost 50\% reduction of the primary energy demand, the installation of 4 GW of offshore wind or the shift to a bio based economy is needed.

TI  - Integration of wireless and remote monitoring in condition monitoring systems for offshore applications
AB  - Offshore platforms often contain mission-critical equipment that should be monitored on a real-time basis, but because of the hazardous and hard-to-reach environments they are located in, there are always challenges to the conventional method of using wired sensors and on-site monitoring. The wireless sensor and remote monitoring technologies, introduced in this paper, enables practical condition monitoring to detect early signs of change in machine conditions with limited investment and optimize their overall maintenance program and workflow remotely, for rotating assets on offshore platforms. The system introduced in this paper is comprised of the wireless sensor and software with remote monitoring capability. The wireless sensor is able to measure key condition monitoring parameters including dynamic vibration data to detect early sign of change in machine condition and support to identify its failure mode as well. Because of its wireless design, initial investment of installation can be minimized. The software interface is designed to provide adequate information to complete asset condition assessment and root cause analysis of the machine failure when it occurs. The software is capable of monitoring assets located on multiple platforms through the network. The data provided by the software can be utilized not only for machine health monitoring but also for reliability assessment, reviewing effectiveness of maintenance at pre & post maintenance or advanced analysis by using the latest technologies, ultimately optimizing maintenance program for those assets observed based on the data captured by the system. The software is designed to comply with network security requirements of today to establish secure network connections for remote access from an on-shore facility, making condition monitoring data readily accessible, and remotely for analysis by a qualified diagnostic team. This feature allows offshore platform maintenance engineers to plan maintenance tasks effectively. What maintenance tasks need to be performed for which assets, which probable tools and materials are needed will be determined and organized in advance before a maintenance resource is mobilized based on actual data measured the assets. This could potentially reduce the number of trips to remote area where the assets are located such as unmanned platforms, minimize time to be spent by the maintenance resource per visit, optimizing overall maintenance program without compromising asset reliability, quality of maintenance, and safety risk. This new system with the wireless sensor presented in this paper does not only enhance the visibility of asset condition, but also possible to improve the effectiveness of maintenance tasks and optimize the overall maintenance program with reduced safety & environmental risks for assets on offshore platforms.

TI  - Predicting accelerating subsidence above the highly compacting luconia reservoirs, offshore Sarawak Malaysia
AB  - Sarawak Shell Bhd has a number of offshore gas fields that produce from the Luconia carbonate formation, which can exhibit high compressibility pore collapse deformation. Recent accelerated subsidence has been observed at several of these fields, which extrapolates to final subsidence values well above previous estimates. This paper describes a geomechanical study involving core work to determine if the Luconia formation compressibility is sensitive to brine flow from the rising aquifer, and a 3D geomechanical finite element model developed to predict future subsidence and lateral movements for the F23 platform. Compaction tests were performed on Luconia core from three different gas fields. Tests on twin plugs were conducted one plug undergoing a standard uniaxial constant-lateral-strain compaction test, while it's twin has several pore volumes of simulated formation brine flowed through it (at virgin in-situ stress conditions) prior to the compaction loading. Four sets of compaction tests on twin plugs were completed. The higher porosity samples showed characteristic pore collapse behavior, consistent with previous measurements on Luconia mouldic limestone core. No sensitivity to brine flow was observed. In situ compaction logs in the field also do not show increased compressibility in sections flooded by the rising gas-water contact. The geomechanical model uses a relatively simple structural model comprised of two overburden, the Luconia carbonate, and one underburden formations. A non-linear deformation model for the Luconia formation captures the accelerating pore collapse response observed in the core and in-situ compaction measurements. The model is calibrated to GPS-measured platform subsidence, and is consistent with measured core and field compaction properties. The results predict that platform subsidence rates with depletion would level off, with a maximum subsidence of 18.5 +/- 1 feet at an abandonment pressure of 300 psi. Platform subsidence in the two years following the work continues to follow the predicted values. This work illustrates the importance of integrated geomechanical core testing, field monitoring measurements and modeling to accurately predict compaction and subsidence effects in highly compacting environments.

TI  - Reducing the Dimensions of the Ship's Main Switchboard-A Contribution to Energy Efficiency
AB  - Energy efficiency generally implies the efficient use of energy in all sectors of final consumption-industry, services, agriculture, households and transport. Shipping accounts for nearly 3\% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it the sixth largest CO2 producer in the world. This is a result of inefficient ship design, lack of planning and optimal use of resources. As the transport sector expands, so does the pressure for a greener and cleaner maritime industry. Reducing fuel consumption is a major driver of the need for energy efficiency on ships. In this paper, due to the importance of maritime transport, we observed the impact of reducing the dimensions of the main switchboard as a contribution to energy efficiency. This contribution is not of great importance as is the case with the optimization of the navigation route, etc., but it certainly affects the weight and, thus, the fuel consumption, which contributes to energy efficiency in the designed system. The aim of this paper is to optimize the design of the main switchboard by using 2D simulations of possible bus topologies, in order to develop six different busbar models and find one that best meets the requirements. The simulation results indicate the optimal location and dimensions of the busbars in the main switchboard in accordance with the switchgear parameters. Apart from the change in layout and dimensions of the busbars, the replacement of conventional instrument transformers with new current/voltage sensors contributes to a significant reduction in the weight and size of the switchboard, which ultimately benefits energy efficiency.

TI  - The potential environmental response to increasing ocean alkalinity for negative emissions
AB  - The negative emissions technology, artificial ocean alkalinization (AOA), aims to store atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in the ocean by increasing total alkalinity (TA). Calcium carbonate saturation state (Omega CaCO3) and pH would also increase meaning that AOA could alleviate sensitive regions and ecosystems from ocean acidification. However, AOA could raise pH and Omega CaCO3 well above modern-day levels, and very little is known about the environmental and biological impact of this. After treating a red calcifying algae (Corallina spp.) to elevated TA seawater, carbonate production increased by 60\% over a control. This has implication for carbon cycling in the past, but also constrains the environmental impact and efficiency of AOA. Carbonate production could reduce the efficiency of CO2 removal. Increasing TA, however, did not significantly influence Corallina spp. primary productivity, respiration, or photophysiology. These results show that AOA may not be intrinsically detrimental for Corallina spp. and that AOA has the potential to lessen the impacts of ocean acidification. However, the experiment tested a single species within a controlled environment to constrain a specific unknown, the rate change of calcification, and additional work is required to understand the impact of AOA on other organisms, whole ecosystems, and the global carbon cycle.

TI  - New 9-7/8-in. HPHT permanent packer with new back-up system provides North Sea operator with an effective solution for worn casing
AB  - A major operator in the North Sea had experienced a problem with worn casing at the packer setting depth of an existing HPHT well, causing a leak into the production annulus. This problem required a workover, and a calliper survey was conducted after retrieving the tubing. Two large grooves along the longitudinal axis of the casing at 120Â° to each other were found. Since the worn casing was the problem, a new permanent packer was required, and this paper will discuss the process required to successfully qualify and install an HPHT permanent packer that would satisfactorily address the needs for worn casing. Permanent packers are qualified by ISO 14310 V0 in a test fixture to meet the API 5CT internal casing dimensions; however, they do not account for any wear or damage in the casing. A test program was developed to test the packer for both HPHT well conditions and worn casing. The test program consisted of the following: 1. Install the packer in 9-7/8-in casing and flow test to 3 bpm at 180Â°F to verify that the circulation around the packer would not damage the AflasÂ® element. 2. Perform an application test using synthetic oil to mimic packer loading until failure, including setting, production, and hot/cold shut in.; apply 9,000 psi annulus pressure to support the casing during testing. In this case, the maximum temperature was 343Â°F or above for over 200 hours. 3. Perform a modified ISO 14310 V0 test at 450Â°F with 15,000 psi differential pressure and 400,000 lbf tension and compression. The packer passed all tests with no extrusion of the three-piece multi-durometer AflasÂ® element, and no leaks were detected at any of the load points in the application (liquid) test or modified ISO V0 gas test. The discussion will include information on the packer design, HPHT tests in worn casing, and casing acceptance criteria. This test was the first packer test performed in worn casing that demonstrated the capability of a compliant back-up system to support the entire element in worn casing and at the HPHT conditions.

TI  - An application of artificial reefs to reduce organic enrichment caused by net-cage fish farming: preliminary results
AB  - Two artificial reefs made of porous recycled high-density polyethylene fence material were moored on the sea floor (20-m depth) off the North Beach of Eilat (Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea) in April 1999. One reef was situated below a commercial net-cage fish farm, and a control reef was deployed outside the area of direct influence of the farm. The objective was to determine if a reef below farm cages could alleviate organic loading of the environment by serving as a biological filter. To examine this question in both qualitative and quantitative terms, the two reefs were compared with regard to organic matter in the sediment close by, abundance of fish and invertebrates, particle filtration (retention) efficiency, and change in biomass of fouling organisms. In addition, control sites situated near the two reefs were also monitored to compare the status of the sediment and of associated biota with those of the reefs. The differences in organic matter content of the sediment between each reef and its respective control site were not significant. Also, fish community metrics did not differ significantly, although the total number of fish was 30\%, higher at the farm site. Biomass of fouling organisms (particularly tunicates and bryozoans) varied inconsistently between sites over time. Particle retention efficiency of the reefs was estimated at 240 g C d(-1), based on the reduction in particulate Chl a in water samples taken downstream of the reefs compared with samples taken upstream.

TI  - Landfill gas turbines: Biogas to combined heat and power to biosolids production
AB  - The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage Districtâ€™s 2035 Vision includes the goal to â€œmeet 100% of MMSDâ€™s net energy needs with renewable energy sourcesâ€, and to â€œreduce MMSDâ€™s carbon footprint by 90% from its 2005 baseline.â€ The Landfill Gas Turbine Facility is a major step in realizing that vision. The combined heat and power facility uses landfill gas (a green energy source) to provide electricity for operating the Jones Island Water Reclamation Facility (WRF). Exhaust heat from electricity production will be used to help dry wastewater residuals to produce MilorganiteÂ®, a dried pelletized fertilizer. The turbine facility is the first to use landfill gas for these applications. The attached rendering shows the major components of the facility: the fuel gas conditioning and compression system, the landfill gas turbines, and the waste heat ductwork that ties into the existing facility. The project includes three 4.8-MW Solar Mercury 50 turbines and associated Enerflex gas conditioning and compression systems. There is space and utility accommodation for two additional turbines with associated gas compression equipment. The photograph shows the completed facility. The landfill gas has been procured under a public private partnership between the District and Veolia Environmental Servicesâ€”the owner of the landfill at the time of partnership. The landfill gas is compressed and treated for siloxanes, hydrogen sulfide, and moisture removal at the landfill, and piped to the WRF. Copyright Â© 2013 Water Environment Federation.

TI  - Sub-seafloor carbon dioxide storage potential on the Juan de Fuca plate, western North America
AB  - The Juan de Fuca plate, off the western coast of North America, has been suggested as a site for geological sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide because of its many attractive characteristics (high permeability, large storage capacity, reactive rock types). Here we model CO2 injection into fractured basalts comprising the upper several hundred meters of the sub-seafloor basalt reservoir, overlain with low-permeability sediments and a thick saline water column, to examine the feasibility of this reservoir for CO2 storage. Our simulations indicate that the sub-seafloor basalts of the Juan de Fuca plate may be an excellent CO2 storage candidate, as multiple trapping mechanisms (hydrodynamic, density inversions, and mineralization) act to keep the CO2 isolated from terrestrial environments. Questions remain about the lateral extent and connectivity of the high permeability basalts; however, the lack of wells or boreholes and thick sediment cover maximize storage potential while minimizing potential leakage pathways. Although promising, more study is needed to determine the economic and sociological viability of this option. Â© 2013 The Author.

TI  - Norwegian ship-owners' adoption of alternative fuels
AB  - The shipping sector's rising greenhouse gas emissions are often considered â€œhard-to-abateâ€. Some ship-owners have recently adopted or started to consider the adoption of alternative fuels, but systematic studies of this are still lacking. We address this gap by studying how ship-owners differ in both actual and intended adoption of alternative fuels. We analyze data from a unique survey with 281 ship-owners in Norway, a major ship-owning country and center for maritime technology development, with descriptive statistics and analysis of variance. We find early adopters among large and established ship-owners in offshore, international cargo and domestic passenger shipping segments, which are often subjected to specific contractual demands for alternative fuel adoption. Laggards were typically small and young ship-owners operating in shipping segments where demands for alternative fuel adoption are weak. Our findings also suggest that firms' business strategy and financial and knowledge resources may have relevance for ship-owner's adoption of alternative fuels. Our study has implications for national and international policymaking, highlighting for example how contracting mechanisms can be an effective tool in incentivizing the adoption of alternative fuels.

TI  - Coastal power plant heat disposal considerations
AB  - A review of the cooling system alternatives for power plants in coastal areas indicates that once-through cooling of seawater is the most favorable from an overall environmental standpoint. Preliminary evaluation of the year-long Thermal Effect Studies conducted at all California coastal power plants indicates that existing thermal discharges are exerting only localized environmental impacts. With proper oceanographic and biological surveys to determine the aquatic inhabitants and hydraulic characteristics of a potential site, a criteria can be developed to discharge the thermal effluent safely into the ecosystem. However conceptually attractive geothermal, hydroelectric, solar, tidal, and fusion power may be, it would appear that none of them has the capability of providing sufficient amounts of power to meet the projected demands for electrical energy during the next two decades.

TI  - Autonomous marine vehicle: A cost effective technology to manage risk in exploration and production
AB  - This abstract discusses the development of a multimission, autonomous sensor platform and describes applications ranging from measuring metocean parameters to detecting oil seeps in a cost effective manner with full Service Quality and HSE compliance. Examples from Gulf of Mexico and other offshore areas of the world demonstrate how persistent, unmanned mobile monitoring platforms have proved beneficial and effective to offshore exploration and production efforts, moving this technology from a state of infancy towards maturity. Accurate meteorological and oceanographic data are essential for developing climate models and weather forecasts used in planning offshore exploration and production operations. A new remotely controlled, autonomous marine vehicle (AMV) supports a variety of sensors for conducting detailed metocean surveys across vast distances and under extreme conditions. To gather this data we use a wave powered AMV that harnesses kinetic energy from wave action to produce locomotion in the ocean, while remaining environmentally friendly and fuel-free; the vehicle is completely self-sustaining using solar panels to power its payloads. The platform includes navigational and control systems with communication to an operations center via satellite. Once deployed the AMV uses no crew, requires no fuel and produces no emissions, thus eliminating both risk to personnel and impact on the environment. For less than the cost of a moored buoy or a vessel and crew, the vehicle provides mobility and long-range endurance for extended ocean monitoring missions. The propulsion system allows it to hold station in tidal or eddy currents. It simply steers to a designated waypoint-a programmed set of geographic coordinates. When it approaches the limits of a predefined watch circle, it turns around and heads back to the same point repeatedly. The AMV can maintain station for long durations with a watch circle of 25 to 50 m [82 to 164 ft], depending on currents and sea state. By contrast, the mooring systems of deep-ocean buoys employ ground tackle that produces a much wider watch circle the AMV can accommodate a broad range of off-the-shelf or custom sensors to fit the needs of the mission. A GPS receiver not only determines vehicle position, it provides a precise time stamp for all data recorded on the mission. Photovoltaic panels keep lithium-ion batteries charged to support WiFi, cellular or satellite communications systems, onboard data processing and various payloads. This technology can and has assisted clients in providing early warning signs from a meteorological and oceanographic perspective for better managing risks and making critical decisions in protecting personnel and assets on installations both manned and unmanned. Value is enhanced when a number of these sensors are deployed on a swarm of vehicles to conduct pre-site baseline surveys for risk and insurance management.

TI  - Production of biopolymer schizophyllan using local sources in Malaysia
AB  - In recent years polymer flooding has been field tested extensively and has succeeded in many Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) projects. The use of synthetic polymers in EOR is undesirable from an environmental perspective. Further, due to limitations of the existing synthetic polymers in high temperature and high salinity conditions, thermal degradation among other drawbacks, biopolymers have attracted the attention of the petroleum Industry. Recently, the use of biopolymer schizophyllan for polymer flooding operations has been found to have advantages such as stability under high temperature and high salinity conditions. This biopolymer is commercially produced from the fungus schizophyllum commune using glucose as a carbon source via fermentation process and is currently available in small quantities as an expensive purified pharmaceutical and cosmetic grade material. Our study aims to utilize locally available sources in Malaysia to synthesize the above biopolymer making it cost effective. The fungus schizophyllum commune commonly known as "cendawan kukur" in Malaysia was used as a starting material. Different production media containing carbon and nitrogen sources, required for the growth of the fungus, were utilized for the biopolymer production. Initial viscosity studies carried out using rheometer showed that, the production media comprising sago starch as the carbon source and potato extract as the nitrogen source, showed the highest viscosity value of 0.12 Pa-s at 30Â°C. Therefore, this media was chosen as the most favorable media for the biopolymer production. Further, the biopolymer extracted from this media was identified by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy which showed similarity in chemical structure with reference to commercial schizophyllan data from the literature. The results from Thermo Gravimetric (TG) analysis showed that the biopolymer was thermally stable at higher temperatures similar to that of the commercial schizophyllan. This study would develop the utilization of locally available sources to produce schizophyllan for polymer flooding operations by explaining various characteristics so as to meet the expected requirements for it to be applied in an oil field.

TI  - The renaissance of Odum's outwelling hypothesis in `Blue Carbon' science
AB  - The term `Blue Carbon' was coined about a decade ago to highlight the important carbon sequestration capacity of coastal vegetated ecosystems. The term has paved the way for the development of programs and policies that preserve and restore these threatened coastal ecosystems for climate change mitigation. Blue carbon research has focused on quantifying carbon stocks and burial rates in sediments or accumulating as biomass. This focus on habitat-bound carbon led us to losing sight of the mobile blue carbon fraction. Oceans, the largest active reservoir of carbon, have become somewhat of a blind spot. Multiple recent investigations have revealed high outwelling (i.e., lateral fluxes or horizontal exports) of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic (DOC) carbon, as well as particulate organic carbon (POC) from blue carbon habitats. In this paper, we conceptualize outwelling in mangrove, saltmarsh, seagrass and macroalgae ecosystems, diagnose key challenges preventing robust quantification, and pave the way for future work integrating mobile carbon in the blue carbon framework. Outwelling in mangroves and saltmarshes is usually dominated by DIC (mostly as bicarbonate), while POC seems to be the major carbon species exported from seagrass meadows and macroalgae forests. Carbon outwelling science is still in its infancy, and estimates remain limited spatially and temporally. Nevertheless, the existing datasets imply that carbon outwelling followed by ocean storage is relevant and may exceed local sediment burial as a long-term (>centuries) blue carbon sequestration mechanism. If this proves correct as more data emerge, ignoring carbon outwelling may underestimate the perceived sequestration capacity of blue carbon ecosystems.

TI  - Power system modeling of 20% wind-generated electricity by 2030
AB  - The Wind Energy Deployment System model was used to estimate the costs and benefits associated with producing 20% of the nation's electricity from wind technology by 2030. This generation capacity expansion model selects from electricity generation technologies that include pulverized coal plants, combined cycle natural gas plants, combustion turbine natural gas plants, nuclear plants, and wind technology to meet projected demand in future years. Technology cost and performance projections, as well as transmission operation and expansion costs, are assumed. This study demonstrates that producing 20% of the nation's projected electricity demand in 2030 from wind technology is technically feasible, not cost-prohibitive, and provides benefits in the forms of carbon emission reductions, natural gas price reductions, and water savings.

TI  - Could water worries scupper shale gas?
AB  - Water shortages could pose as a great threat to energy security as political instability or terrorism. The energy investment bankers have revealed that the water quality in the US could also bring shale gas exploration and production to a halt. Shale gas, which has emerged as a new energy source and the water intensity to hydraulically fracture the shale, is extreme. The US Environmental Protection Agency is studying the safety of frac water disposal. Ocean Energy Institute is working with the University of Maine to develop a large wind farm offshore New England. The project would use electricity generated by wind to produce liquid ammonia to fuel a new generation of cars, with desalinated water as a byproduct. Government regulators could halt production under the Clean Water Act of 1972 as early as the end of 2010.

TI  - Greenhouse technology for cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions
AB  - Greenhouses have expanded from Northern areas to other climatic regions in the world, including arid and semi-arid regions. The main limiting factors for greenhouse cultivation in such areas are the high ambient temperatures with low humidity (sometimes with high humidity in coastal areas), typical of these regions during almost all the year, and the availability of good quality water for irrigation and eventually for cooling. Therefore, the technological options for protected cultivation in these areas are quite dependent on the average maximum temperatures along the year. If the area has average maximum temperatures not higher than 30-35Â°C during the autumn, winter and spring months, a lower technology approach can be used, combining the use of simple plastic covered structures, with high natural ventilation capacity (i.e. retractable roof greenhouses or similar technological approaches), selective mobile shading screens (NIR reflection) and/or evaporative cooling, provided that quality water is available or can be produced. During the summer months, cultivation could be moved to highlands, with cooler night-time temperatures, using screenhouses combined with fogging (low or high pressure, depending on the water quality). If temperatures are higher than 30-35Â°C during the whole year, pad and fan combined with selective shading is possibly the best option, avoiding cultivation during the summer months, but limiting the size of the greenhouses. Other more sophisticated technologies have been proposed for these regions, which involve in many cases closing the greenhouse and using highly energy dependent active cooling systems and different ways of seawater desalination. The high energy required to cool actively the greenhouses makes it essential to study carefully the possibilities of using renewable energies (wind, solar, geothermal, etc.) to cover at least, a part of large energy demand, as well as to establish resource conserving climate control strategies. In many cases and for some crops under extreme environments, food security concerns and urbanization makes reasonable to consider the possibility of indoor cultivation (plant factories) as potential economic option if they are demonstrated as resource conserving and profitable technologies and production mechanism.

TI  - Methane in pristine and impaired mangrove soils and its possible effect on establishment of mangrove seedlings
AB  - Pristine and impaired mangrove soils (from road construction, aquaculture, and sewage) in Baja California Sur, Mexico were investigated for methane dynamics, related soil properties, and their impact on initial establishment of black mangrove propagules. All soils (Salic Fluvisols and Histosols) had neutral to alkaline pH, were saline, and had variable organic carbon content, and redox potentials. Most pristine mangrove soils showed low methane concentration, low methane production rates, and no methane emission. Impaired mangrove soil (from aquaculture) and mangrove soil affected by sewage water showed high methane concentration, high methane production rates, and high methane emission, thus acting as a methane source. Elevated methane concentrations, similar to levels detected in the impaired mangrove soil, reduce the growth of seedlings under closed chamber conditions. Addition of sulfate to the soil reversed the trend. These results indicate that impaired mangrove soils in dry climatic regions produce and emit methane and that elevated methane concentration in the vicinity of propagules may affect establishment of mangrove seedlings in impaired mangrove soils.

TI  - Neutral Buoyancy Power Systems for Marine Applications
AB  - The use of traditional marine energy systems is complicated by the influence of the weight of a remote power supply cable, which reduces the mobility of offshore technological complexes. The floating cable are used to solve control and mobility problems. We propose to increase the voltage frequency in the power transmission system up to 1000Â Hz. Increasing the frequency enables to include an additional buoyancy element in marine cables, and the cable acquires properties of unsinkability and reduction of cable copper weight. Electromagnetic compatibility is solved by using voltage inverters on power supply and consumer sides. In addition, we calculate losses in a cable system of neutral buoyancy during energy transfer by Matlab modeling. The use of cable systems of neutral buoyancy is justified where it is required to provide power supply to various kinds of buoy power plants and wind parks on the shelf of moving elements of marine engineering systems.

TI  - Net ecosystem production and organic carbon balance of U.S. East Coast estuaries: A synthesis approach
AB  - Net ecosystem production (NEP) and the overall organic carbon budget for the estuaries along the East Coast of the United States are estimated. We focus on the open estuarine waters, excluding the fringing wetlands. We developed empirical models relating NEP to loading ratios of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to total organic carbon, and carbon burial in the sediment to estuarine water residence time and total nitrogen input across the landward boundary. Output from a data-constrained water quality model was used to estimate inputs of total nitrogen and organic carbon to the estuaries across the landward boundary, including fluvial and tidal-wetland sources. Organic carbon export from the estuaries to the continental shelf was computed by difference, assuming steady state. Uncertainties in the budget were estimated by allowing uncertainties in the supporting model relations. Collectively, U.S. East Coast estuaries are net heterotrophic, with the area-integrated NEP of -1.5 (-2.8, -1.0)TgCyr(-1) (best estimate and 95\% confidence interval) and area-normalized NEP of -3.2 (-6.1, -2.3)molCm(-2)yr(-1). East Coast estuaries serve as a source of organic carbon to the shelf, exporting 3.4 (2.0, 4.3)TgCyr(-1) or 7.6 (4.4, 9.5)molCm(-2)yr(-1). Organic carbon inputs from fluvial and tidal-wetland sources for the region are estimated at 5.4 (4.6, 6.5)TgCyr(-1) or 12 (10, 14)molCm(-2)yr(-1) and carbon burial in the open estuarine waters at 0.50 (0.33, 0.78)TgCyr(-1) or 1.1 (0.73, 1.7)molCm(-2)yr(-1). Our results highlight the importance of estuarine systems in the overall coastal budget of organic carbon, suggesting that in the aggregate, U.S. East Coast estuaries assimilate (via respiration and burial) similar to 40\% of organic carbon inputs from fluvial and tidal-wetland sources and allow similar to 60\% to be exported to the shelf.

TI  - Prospects for renewable energy for seaborne transportation-Taiwan example
AB  - This paper highlights the need for the development of a renewable infrastructure for marine transportation. The result of a survey performed in this study serves as information for public policy makers on the degree to which policy can or should attempt to provide guidelines and incentives in shaping the attitude or behaviors of the industry towards the application. There is a high degree of preference for renewable over fossil as energy source for both ship power and household electricity. While solar is the most favorable energy type for household electricity, hydrogen combustion (80%) is the most supported alternative for powering commercial shipping. The fuel cell (FC) is the next highly favored (64%) alternative energy that is applied onboard ship as perceived by the Taiwanese maritime industry. The result also indicates that the preference of a specific energy type onboard ship is also based upon other factors such as feasibility rather than the respondents' personal preference.

TI  - Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS)
AB  - Carbon capture and sequestration (or storage)-known as CCS-has attracted interest as a measure for mitigating global climate change because large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from fossil fuel use in the United States are potentially available to be captured and stored underground or prevented from reaching the atmosphere. Large, industrial sources of CO2, such as electricity-generating plants, are likely initial candidates for CCS because they are predominantly stationary, single-point sources. Electricity generation contributes over 40% of U.S. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. Congressional interest has grown in CCS as part of legislative strategies to address climate change. On February 13, 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5), which included $3.4 billion for projects and programs related to CCS. Of that amount, $1.52 billion would be made available for a competitive solicitation for industrial carbon capture and energy efficiency improvement projects, $1 billion for the renewal of FutureGen, and $800 million for U.S. Department of Energy Clean Coal Power Initiative Round III solicitations, which specifically target coal-based systems that capture and sequester, or reuse, CO2 emissions. The $3.4 billion contained in ARRA greatly exceeds the federal government's cumulative outlays for CCS research and development since 1997. The large and rapid influx of funding for industrial-scale CCS projects may accelerate development and deployment of CO2 capture technologies. Currently, U.S. power plants do not capture large volumes of CO2 for CCS, even though technology is available that can potentially remove 80%-95% of CO2 from a point source. This is due, in part, to the absence of either an economic incentive (i.e., a price for captured CO2) or a regulatory requirement to curtail CO2 emissions. In addition, DOE estimates that CCS costs between $100 and $300 per metric ton (2,200 pounds) of carbon emissions avoided using current technologies. Those additional costs mean that power plants with CCS would require more fuel, and costs per kilowatt-hour would be higher than for plants without CCS. After CO2 is captured from the source and compressed into a liquid, pipelines or ships would likely convey the captured CO2 to storage sites to be injected underground. Three main types of geological formations are being considered for storing large amounts of CO2 as a liquid: oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline reservoirs, and unmineable coal seams. The deep ocean also has a huge potential to store carbon; however, direct injection of CO2 into the deep ocean is still experimental, and environmental concerns have forestalled planned experiments in the open ocean. Mineral carbonation-reacting minerals with a stream of concentrated CO2 to form a solid carbonate-is well understood, but it also is still an experimental process for storing large quantities of CO2. The increase in funding for CCS provided for in ARRA and by other economic incentives may lead to less expensive and more effective technologies for capturing large quantities of CO2. Without a carbon price or a regulatory requirement to cap CO2 emissions, however, it will be difficult to predict or evaluate how the technology would be deployed throughout the U.S. energy sector. By comparison, transporting, injecting, and storing CO2 underground may be less daunting. A large pipeline infrastructure for transporting CO2 could be very costly, however, and considerable uncertainty remains over how large quantities of injected CO2 would be permanently stored underground. To help resolve these uncertainties, DOE has initiated large-scale CO2 injection tests in a variety of geologic reservoirs that are to take place over the next several years.

TI  - Optimal management of a renewable and replaceable resource: The case of coastal groundwater
AB  - The nonrenewable-with-backstop model of resource management is extended to cover renewables and applied to the case of coastal groundwater. In the optimal management trajectory, efficiency price exceeds extraction cost by the sum of scarcity rent and ``drawdown{''} cost, the latter remaining large even after the backstop price is reached. In the case of rising demand, optimal management may call for a stage of conservation followed by a stage of drawdown.

TI  - Centrifugal compressors and pumps for CO2 applications
AB  - The environmental community is studying the possibility to capture carbon dioxide and inject it into some natural storage facility such as caverns or old oil fields now empty. The process is named carbon capture and storage (CCS) and can represent a good way to reduce the emission to the atmosphere. The most suitable way to store the CO2 is by using centrifugal compressors and also centrifugal pumps to reach the reservoir pressure typically at supercritical conditions. Many configurations have been studied. The most common is using only in-line centrifugal compressors and basically consist of a driver (steam turbine or electric motor) and two centrifugal compressors in a back-to-back configuration for a total of four process sections. This solution is proven by experience in several Urea Plants and now under engineering for a project located off Australian coast where it is used to store the CO 2. Other alternative machines consist of integrally geared compressors to improve absorbed power and plant layout. Pumps are widely used for liquefied gas application and can be sued also in CO2 service. Finally a combination of compressor and pumps can be developed to further reduce the overall compression power. The paper will describe the above configurations for CO2 application.

TI  - A streamlined workflow from experimental analyses to dynamic geochemical modelling
AB  - Dynamic-geochemical model is a powerful instrument to evaluate the geochemical effects on CO2 storage capacity, injectivity and long-term containment. The study objective is to apply an integrated multi-step workflow to a carbon capture and storage (CCS) candidate field (offshore), namely hereinafter H field. From experimental analyses, a comprehensive real data-tailored reactive transport model (RTM) has been built to capture the dynamics and the geochemical phenomena (e.g., water vaporization, CO2 solubility, mineral alteration) occurring during and after the CO2 injection in sedimentary formations. The proposed integrated workflow couples lab activities and numerical simulations and it is developed according to the following steps: 1. Mineralogical-chemical characterization (XRD, XRF and SEM-EDX experimental techniques) of field core samples; 2. Data elaboration and integration to define the conceptual geochemical model; 3. Synthetic brine reconstruction by means of 0D geochemical models; 4. Numerical geochemical modelling at different complexity levels. Field rocks chosen for CO2 injection have been experimentally characterized, showing a high content of Fe in clayey, micaceous and carbonate mineralogical phases. New-defined, site-specific minerals have been characterized, starting from real XRD, XRF and SEM-EDX data and by calculation of their thermochemical parameters with a proprietary procedure. They are used to reconstruct synthetic formation water chemical composition (at equilibrium with both rock mineralogy and gas phase), subsequently used in RTM. CO2 injection is simulated using 2D radial reactive transport model(s) built in a commercial compositional reservoir simulator. The simulations follow a step-increase in the complexity of the model by adding CO2 solubility, water vaporization and geochemical reactions. Geochemical processes impact on CO2 storage capacity and injectivity is quantitatively analyzed. The results show that neglecting the CO2 solubility in formation water may underestimate the max CO2 storage capacity in H field by around 1%, maintaining the same pressure build-up profile. Sensitivities on the impact of formation water salinity on the CO2 solubility are presented. In a one thousand years' timescale, changes in reservoir porosity due to mineral alteration, triggered by CO2-brine-rock interactions, seem to be minimal in the near wellbore and far field. However, it has been seen that water vaporization with the associated halite precipitation inclusion in the simulation models is recommended, especially at high-level of formation brine salinity, for a reliable evaluation of CO2 injectivity related risks. The proposed workflow provides a new perspective in geochemical application for CCS studies, which relies on novel labs techniques (analyses automation), data digitalization, unification and integration with a direct connection to the numerical models. The presented procedure can be followed to assess the geochemical short-and long-term risks in carbon storage projects. Copyright Â© 2021 Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Laytime and demurrage implications in voyage charterparties for chemical tankers
AB  - Maritime transportation is one of the worst offenders for air, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Reducing the emissions in shipping is a common goal for all stakeholders involved in the shipping process. The purpose of this paper was to explore the implications of the laytime and demurrage provisions when using existing charterparties and to suggest how the areas where charterers are exposed to demurrage can be addressed and thus improve sustainability. A comparative analysis was conducted on selected standard voyage charterparties. The findings revealed various areas that do not protect a charterer's interest. It is proposed that in order to solve this challenge a global group consisting of stakeholders be formed to collectively design laytime and demurrage clauses in order to achieve greater sustainability and reduce demurrage. A revised charterparty form for the transportation of chemical liquid bulk chemicals by tankers could then be created. Â© The Author(s) 2021. Published by Inderscience Publishers Ltd.

TI  - Development of the gryphon field injection wing - Technical challenges and risks
AB  - The Gryphon Field (UK. Central North Sea) development commenced in 1993 with the successful exploitation of massive sand rich turbidite lobes of the Balder formation by horizontal wells. A component of small scale sand injection had been identified during appraisal and subsequent development but it wasn't until the acquisition of long offset simultaneous inversion seismic data in 2002 that the scale of the injection wing along the eastern edge of the field was appreciated. A full evaluation of the subsurface uncertainties led to the injection wing being matured as a development target although one which presented new challenges. The main challenge proved to be locating and then geosteering through a three dimensionally constrained target with high lateral positional uncertainty and potential for wellbore instability. A multi-disciplinary team met this challenge with a combination of new technologies (e.g. prototype deep reading and azimuthal resistivity LWD tools) and the rigourous implementation of wellbore stability recommendations offshore. Further technologies and strategies to mitigate these risks were introduced in the course of the drilling campaign (e.g. directional survey uncertainty reduction by In-Field Referencing and Dual Inclination techniques, landout strategies to address lateral positioning uncertainty, optimisation of well planning involving the multi-disciplinary team in a 3D environment and the use of low-rheology muds). Production in some of the injection wing wells has substantially exceeded prediction whereas others have been more challenging to produce due to a faster than anticipated water-cut development. When averaged over all the wells, production targets have been exceeded. The injection wing play has helped rejuvenate the field with seven wells drilled in the structure between 2004 and 2006 which, as of May 2007, have produced approximately 11 million barrels of oil and are contributing 80% of daily production.

TI  - Control design of a gyro-based wave energy converter for autonomous underwater vehicle
AB  - Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is an intelligent machine that works at hazardous underwater environment. It can only operate for hours or days at a time by battery charging system. This paper presents a new gyroscopic charging system to reform the traditional way. The new system utilizes the gyroscopic effects of a large rotating flywheel in combination with a controlled power take-off device to extract power from wave motion. In this paper, a gyroscopic energy converter model is given, which contains a description of dynamic equation and controlling design. Consequently, a detailed process of applying the gyroscopic system to a typical AUV is shown. The gyroscopic charging system promises to reduce AUV battery requirements negating the necessity to carry sufficient energy reserves (size and weight) for entire missions, reduce costs by freeing support vessel time (a major cost component in AUV deployment) and enable AUVs to be remotely and renewably recharged at sea, indefinitely extending missions. Software simulation is the main method to prove the validation of the results. The results show that the generated power is sufficient to provide power for AUV which is better than the battery charging system.

TI  - LES study of CO2 enriched gravity currents
AB  - Earlier integrated gravity current models have been used to study both natural existing ocean currents and artificially generated currents with CO2 enriched seawater. The latter being a possible option for ocean disposal of waste CO2 from powerplants or other large point sources. These types of models are not resolving the interior of the current but only describes the mean velocity and density over cross-sections. The models parameterise friction and entrainment, and earlier studies have shown a high sensitivity on the friction parameterisation and thereby the entrainment of ambient water. In this study a Navier Stokes solver connected with a Large Eddy Simulation (LES), to account for the cascade of energy to subgrid scale eddies, is used to model the current close to the outlet. The code resolves the interior of the current and no entrainment or friction parameterisations are needed. Only the first 250 meters after the outlet are modelled and the results shows high entrainment. The numerical results are used together with a simple time dependent integrated gravity current model to estimate entrainment and friction parameters. Â© 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - A successful deployment of permanent coiled tubing gas lift completion in sabah mature deepwater SPAR asset providing significant effects on production
AB  - A mature deepwater asset of 1,330 m of water depth offshore Sabah, Malaysia, has been delivering notable production since 2007, and currently the field is in its declining mode. The second phase of the field development focused on producing from the thin-bed layers of the reservoirs, which were found less efficient in pressure maintenance given existing water injection support as the primary support. Initial conceptual studies were conducted between 2012 and 2014 to determine which improved oil recovery (IOR) initiative would be the most effective and economical way to retain declining production of the field, extend end-of-life, and ultimately protect reserves. Further in-house engineering studies and follow-up with a field mini-trial in 2014 demonstrated that providing gas lift to the spar wells would improve and revive production of the targeted wells. A permanent coiled tubing (CT) with gas lift completion (CTGL) was determined as the most efficient and cost-effective solution. Single-point gas injection is sufficient given available injection pressure, static/ dynamic fluid level, and the available maximum depth of the injection tip. Modifications of the dry tree on the spar facility were required to accommodate the changes; changes included a new 5-in. gas lift pipeline; topside piping at the spar; and installation of associated control, metering, and instrumentation devices. Specific CT bottomhole assembly (BHA)/components were determined to safely deliver gas inside the 3.5-in. and 4.5-in. production tubing to slightly above the wellâ€™s downhole safety valve. A total of 14 dry-tree wells were selected for this project and the project has successfully completed installation of CTGL in 11 wells by mid-year 2019. Wellhead modification was carried out by installing the tubinghead spool and gas injection arm. A CT rigid riser well stackup was rigged up directly on the tubinghead spool. The 1.25-in. outer diameter (OD) chrome CT string and gas lift BHA of specific simulated venturi sizes were deployed to the targeted depth in each well. Downhole completion safety valve and gas lift BHA double flapper check valves were then be inflow tested. Blowout preventer (BOP) was engaged against the 1.25-in. OD CT string, and pressure in the well stackup above the rams was bled off before cutting off the CT string. The CT tubing hanger was made up directly on the cut CT string. Finally, the CT tubing hanger was installed into the tubinghead spool with a 4-in. flow release pulling tool. An additional simulation study was performed to confirm the ability of the 1.25-in. OD CT BHA to inject up to 3 MMscf/D. The executed wells were brought online, and a comparison of the well tests was performed. The CTGL wells responded very well whilst being assisted with gas lift, which delivers an outstanding result by adding incremental gain of 20%, and even adding value to revive idle wells, which has significant value by doubling the base production figure without gas lift. An estimate of more than 50% protected reserves can be achieved with the 11 CTGL wells at the end of field life. The installation and execution of CTGL came at the right time as the field requires lift assistance to stay productive. Copyright Â© 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - A revolutionary hybrid solution to the grand challenge of developing deepwater stranded gas
AB  - Many deepwater gas fields remain stranded in the currcnt economic environment. Conventional surface solutions result in large facilities that are heavy and costly. Subsea solutions are challenged when confronted with long distance tie-backs. While the FLNG option initially looked promising, high CAPEX and very high OPEX have limited its potential application, with four potential FLNG projects being canccllcd in Australasia in the last two years. A revolutionary new solution, a proprietary 'Hybrid Conceptâˆ— has emerged to solve this grand challenge of developing deepwater gas fields. It is not surface, not subsea, but the ultimate combination of both, offering fundamentally more efficient and hence lower cost processing. The concept incorporates several principals that have been overlooked to date, namely:- Fundamental differences in cost between surface liquids and surface gas processing There is a key distinction and granularity between the costs for surface processing of liquids and surface processing of gas. Liquids can be processed on the surface relatively efficiently. It is the high pressure surface gas systems that have a disproportionate impact on size, weight and cost of surface facilities. Fundamental Processing differences for liquids and gas Cold temperatures are required for gas processing and this is efficiently found near the seabed. In contrast, liquids processing requires heat both to efficiently separate and stabilise the components. Subsea Dehydration Dehydration is the core unit operation to allow long distance pipeline transfer by preventing hydrates and corrosion. Dehydration has been almost universally applied to onshore and fixed platform processing facilities, thus allowing dry, single phase pipeline transfer. Existing subsea gas developments rely on either adding chemicals or heat and insulation to avoid hydrate formation and reduce corrosion. While successful across short to medium distances, across longer distances and in deeper waters these methods prove far less efficient and much more costly. The Hybrid Concept fully processes the high pressure gas on the seabed in two stages. The first stage includes active cooling and bulk water separation and removal. In the second stage, the gas is processed w ith liquids removed to achieve full subsea dehydration. All liquids arc directed to a simple and compact. low pressure surface unit. This surface unit provides support to the subsea processing, reducing complexity, costs and project risk. The result is significantly lower development CAPfcX and lower OPEX, with a minimum of complexity, giving an acceptable project risk. Importantly all components are proven and require a minimum of technical development. Safety is significantly improved with no high pressure gas on the surface and a significantly reduced permanent offshore workforce required. The details of this concept, along with its significant advantages are discussed in this paper. Â©2017, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - A Study on Identification of Development Status of MASS Technologies and Directions of Improvement
AB  - The introduction of the maritime autonomous surface ship (MASS) to the maritime industry will open up a new era and bring about a new paradigm shift in terms of cost efficiency, maritime accidents, and human resources. Various studies are currently being conducted to realize the MASS. Understanding the scope and direction of these studies will be of great help for future MASS research. In this study, the current development status of technologies for autonomous ships is identified, and considerations and directions of improvement are suggested for six major research fields that cover all technological issues of MASS. Firstly, the results of the regulatory scoping exercise (RSE) on the International Maritime Organization (IMO) conventions to accept MASSs are identified; in particular, human elements are identified as vital issues to be considered for the design and operation of MASSs. Secondly, various studies on the decision-making system are identified, and the future direction is suggested. Thirdly, in terms of ship design and propulsion system, design changes for autonomous cargo ships are investigated, with their potential impacts to be considered. Fourthly, the communication system will need to be robust and supported by multiple systems to minimize potential risk with third-party infrastructures, and suitable protection of systems, networks, and data will be required as an integral part of the safety system for cybersecurity. Fifthly, issues of maintenance and repair are identified, with a maintenance strategy to be considered. Lastly, hazard analysis of the autonomous ship is explored, and system-theoretic process analysis (STPA) and the functional resonance analysis method (FRAM) are identified as the most representative new methods that can be used for hazard analysis of autonomous ships.

TI  - Assessment of submarine geothermal resources and development of tools to quantify their energy potentials for environmentally sustainable development
AB  - Submarine geothermal reservoirs contain huge amounts of energy, not been used so far but recently considered for exploitation. Their energy potentials are much larger than those of onshore geothermal resources and can cover significant parts of the global future energy demands in an environmentally sustainable way. There are two types: (i) deep resources along oceanic spreading centers, where uprising magma heats fluids circulating through fissured rocks, which emerge at vents at temperatures up to 460 Â°C, mixing with seawater (depth: 1000-4000 m below sea level), and (ii) coastal shallow resources where geothermal fluids emerge at fractures (depth: 1-50 m). The total length of deep systems is âˆ¼65,000 km and there are sites where pressure and temperature are high enough that they are at supercritical conditions. The first part of this paper assesses global information on submarine geothermal resources, concluding that - using mature technology from onshore geothermal and offshore hydrocarbon exploitation - submarine geothermal resources can be an economical affordable option for energy supplies at small-large scale. In the second part a - generally valid - robust, mathematical approach is developed to quantify these resources and its applicability is demonstrated using two examples. In Baja California (Mexico), the coastal submarine geothermal potential per cubic kilometer of rock of Punta Banda, Wagner Depression and Gulf of California resulted 245, 350 and 528 MWT/km3, respectively. Transforming only 1% of this energy into electricity the capacity of the Gulf of California alone is âˆ¼26,000 MWe. The submarine geothermal system of Santorini Caldera (Greece) yielded 869 MWe (reservoir 100 km3). Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Development potential for offshore placer and aggregate resources of Nova Scotia, Canada.
AB  - The prerequisites for the formation of placer Au deposits are met for offshore Nova Scotia, Canada. Auriferous bedrock was comminuted by glaciers, and the resulting auriferous detritus was sorted and winnowed by fluvial and marine sedimentary processes. In additon to Au, Sn, W, ilmenite, garnet, and Zr have placer potential offshore. Placer minerals may form important by-products to offshore aggregate operations. Extensive, untapped sand, sand and gravel deposits have been mapped offshore Nova Scotia with large portions of these deposits occurring in water depths that would permit mining with established dredging technology. Presents the development history and current structure of the aggregate industry in Nova Scotia with emphasis on fixed aggregate markets in the major urban centers of the Province. As well, recent studies and developments which could trigger offshore aggregate production are discussed.-from Authors

TI  - Potential Contribution of Coastal Upwelling to Carbon Sink through Interaction between Cyanobacteria and Microbial Eukaryotes
AB  - Upwelling, a common oceanographic event, can make great contributions, directly or indirectly, to deep ocean carbon sequestration. However, the extent of its contribution indirectly depends on the composition of microbial communities and the interactions between bacterioplankton and other microorganisms. This study provides insights into the influence of upwelling on bacterioplankton at the whole community level and predicts their potential functional profiles. The alpha diversity of the bacterial community exhibited no significant differences between the upwelling area and non-upwelling area, while the community composition varied clearly in different habitats. Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were the five dominant phyla in all of the habitats. The proportions of members of Firmicutes were increased whereas Cyanobacteria were reduced in upwelling water. However, the percentage of Cyanobacteria was enhanced in the upwelling deep water. Functional genes that are involved in signal transductions, which belong to environmental information processing, were more active in upwelling surface water than in the other habitats. Closer and more complex relationships between bacterioplankton and microbial eukaryotes were found in the upwelling area, which altered with the variation of the external environmental conditions. Cyanobacteria showed a positive correlation with microbial eukaryotes in upwelling deep water. Combined with the high proportions of Cyanobacteria in upwelling deep water, this might be strong evidence that Cyanobacteria contribute to a deep ocean carbon sink. Overall, our study reveals the impacts of upwelling on the bacterial community composition, metabolic functions, and microbial interactions, which are significant to further understanding the carbon sink effects of upwelling.

TI  - Ocean iron fertilization and international law
AB  - Intentional ocean fertilization and the commercial sale of associated carbon offsets raise a number of issues in international law. On the one hand, states are obliged to adopt adaptation and mitigation measures to prevent dangerous climate change. On the other hand, international law obliges states to protect and preserve the marine environment and to act in a precautionary manner in the face of scientific uncertainty. In this article, we examine the application of the international Law of the Sea to ocean fertilization, with particular reference to the law's dumping regime, which prohibits the dumping of wastes or other materials from vessels into the ocean. We then examine the application of the international legal regime on climate change to ocean fertilization and assess the international legal basis for the sale of carbon offsets or carbon credits associated with ocean fertilization. We conclude that ocean fertilization is governed by the dumping regime and that its commercialization is inconsistent with international law unless and until independent, internationally peer-reviewed scientific research and assessment demonstrates that it is effective and that its benefits outweigh the risks to the marine environment.

TI  - Leading edges in bioremediation technologies for removal of petroleum hydrocarbons
AB  - There is a worldwide concern regarding soil pollution caused by contamination of petroleum hydrocarbon, released during oil processing or production. Once a spill occurs, it disturbs the marine and freshwater ecosystem and greatly threatens human health. It usually requires complex technologies to remove it from soil. Petroleum hydrocarbons contain a range of chemicals which are extremely toxic and carcinogenic in nature. Although physical or chemical methods are widely employed for remediation, numerous studies revealed that bioremediation is a sustainable approach. Bioremediation is often preferred as clean and carbon-neutral solution. This review aims to provide series of sustainable solution for petroleum hydrocarbon degradation without exploiting the environment as well as opportunity to reuse treated media. Integrated and enhanced bioremediation technologies are more effective than natural degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in terms of shorter time period and percent removal efficiency. It comprehensively illustrates bioremediation assisted with bacteria, fungi, and algae either by integrated technologies or by enhancing the process. Most recent application methods of petroleum hydrocarbon bioremediation (in situ and ex situ) are also reported. There is dire need to explore different cost-effective biotechnological resources for degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon by the screening of novel microbial strains or by the creation of genetically engineered bacteria to survive in harsh environment.

TI  - Measuring mangrove carbon loss and gain in deltas
AB  - Demand for mangrove forest resources has led to a steady decline in mangrove area over the past century. Land conversions in the form of agriculture, aquaculture and urbanization account for much of the deforestation of mangrove wetlands. However, natural processes at the transition zone between land and ocean can also rapidly change mangrove spread. In this study, we applied a robust field-based carbon inventory and new structural and temporal remote sensing techniques to quantify the magnitude and change of mangrove carbon stocks in major deltas across Africa and Asia. From 2000-2016, approximately 1.6\% (12 270 ha) of the total mangrove area within these deltas disappeared, primarily through erosion and conversion to agriculture. However, the rapid expansion of mangroves in some regions during this same period resulted in new forests that were taller and more carbon-dense than the deforested areas. Because of the rapid vertical growth rates and horizontal expansion, new mangrove forests were able to offset the total carbon losses of 5 332 843 Mg C by 44\%. Each hectare of new mangrove forest accounted for similar to 84\% to similar to 160\% of the aboveground carbon for each hectare of mangrove forest lost, regardless of the net change in mangrove area. Our study highlights the significance of the natural dynamics of erosion and sedimentation on carbon loss and sequestration potential for mangroves over time. Areas of naturally regenerating mangroves will have a much larger carbon sequestration potential if the rate of mangrove deforestation of taller forests is curbed.

TI  - Technical performance analysis and economic evaluation of a compressed air energy storage system integrated with an organic Rankine cycle
AB  - Energy storage becomes increasingly important in balancing electricity supply and demand due to the rise of intermittent power generation from renewable sources. The compressed air energy storage (CAES) system as one of the large scale (>100 MW) energy storage technologies has been commercially deployed in Germany and the USA. However, the efficiency of current commercial CAES plants still needs to be improved. In this study, an integrated system consisting of a CAES system and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) was proposed to recover the waste heat from intercoolers and aftercooler in the charging process and exhaust stream of the recuperator in discharging process of the CAES system. Steady state process models of the CAES system and ORC were developed in Aspen PlusÂ®. These models were validated using data from the literature and the results appear in a good agreement. Process analysis was carried out using the validated models regarding the impact of different organic working fluids (R123, R134a, R152a, R245fa, R600a) of ORC and expander inlet pressures of the ORC on system performance. It was found that integrating ORC with the CAES system as well as selecting appropriate working fluid was a reasonable approach for improving performance of the CAES system. The round-trip efficiency was improved by 3.32â€“3.95% using five working fluids, compared to that of the CAES system without ORC. Economic evaluation on levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) was performed using Aspen Process Economic AnalyserÂ® (APEA). Different working fluids in ORC and different power sources (e.g. wind and solar) associated with the integrated system were considered to estimate the LCOEs. It was found that the LCOEs for the integrated system were competitive with fossil-fuel fired power and even lower than offshore wind power and solar power. The proposed research presented in this paper hopes to shed light on how to improve efficiency and reduce cost when implementing CAES. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - A toxic-free environment ambition in the light of the Polish Baltic Sea coastal zone pollution by heavy metals
AB  - The European Green Deal highlights the need for anthropogenic pressure reduction according to the toxic-free environment ambition. Heavy metals are the largest threat to the food sector sustainability while they are easily bioaccumulated by living organisms, especially aquatic species. Cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg) introduced to the food chain were proven to have a toxic impact on human health causing serious diseases such as Parkinson's disease, kidney and heart failure, osteoporosis, etc. Lead(Pb) can be accumulated by humans from contaminated plants and water resulting in mental retardation and birth defects. The study analyzes the sources of the above heavy metals pollution in the Polish coastal zone of the Baltic Sea which is the main fishing area for the fishing industry in Poland. Available data on the atmospheric deposition and riverine loads of Cd, Pb, Hg were analyzed to present the current trends of heavy metals contamination in 3 basins located in the Polish coastal zone: Bornholm Basin (BB), Eastern Gotland Basin (EGB) and Gdansk Basin (GB). The results show that in the BB and EGB the limits for all 3 heavy metals were exceeded even by 139.58\% in terms of Cd in 2018 in both basins. Pb limit was exceeded in 2018 by 84.62\% in BB and by 123.08\% in 2017 in EGB. On the contrary, values below the limit for Cd and Hg were observed in GB during the entire monitoring period, while the limit for Pb was only temporarily exceeded.

TI  - Ocean sequestration of crop residue carbon: recycling fossil fuel carbon back to deep sediments
AB  - For significant impact any method to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere must process large amounts of carbon efficiently, be repeatable, sequester carbon for thousands of years, be practical, economical and be implemented soon. The only method that meets these criteria is removal of crop residues and burial in the deep ocean. We show here that this method is 92% efficient in sequestration of crop residue carbon while cellulosic ethanol production is only 32% and soil sequestration is about 14% efficient. Deep ocean sequestration can potentially capture 15% of the current global CO 2 annual increase, returning that carbon back to deep sediments, confining the carbon for millennia,while using existing capital infrastructure and technology. Because of these clear advantages, we recommend enhanced research into permanent sequestration of crop residues in the deep ocean. Â© 2009 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Calera CO2 Sequestration and Enhanced Geothermal Energy
AB  - Calera (CCS) carbon-capture-sequestration and the (EGE) Enhanced Geothermal Energy alternative energy source offer unique opportunities to reexamine feasibility of implementing an electric transportation economy. First opportunity, Calera pilot plant project demonstrates feasibility of reducing exhaust stack CO2 emission by 90% for gas fired electric utilities. Conceptually, Calera CCS commercializes nature's oldest process: ocean coral carbonate sequestration by accelerating nature's ocean CO2 to coral chemistry. The Calera Carbonate Mineralization Aqueous Precipitation (CMAP) process bubbles 370Â° C (700Â° F) electric utility stack exhaust through seawater, sequestering carbon as calcium-magnesium carbonate. Calera cement and carbonate pellet end products convert a CO2 liability into a CCS process cost offset. Second opportunity, Enhanced Geothermal Energy accesses Earth's Jurassic-granite continental crust by drilling conventional wells. At 6 to 10 km depths, granite temperatures are about 250Â° to 300Â° C (482Â° to 572Â° F). Injecting gray-waste water generates steam and offers an opportunity to phase out coal and gas thermal energy sources at electric utility plants. One cubic mile of granite is thermally equivalent to 1.64 Mega bbl crude per degree Kelvin granite temperature drop, 8.65 giga cubic foot natural gas/deg K, and 432 kilo metric tonn bituminous coal per deg K. Our scope is limited to evaluation of these two technologies as potential CO2 mitigation solutions. This study concludes with an urgent focus on investing in these two new technologies to reduce them to practice, instead of continuing to invest in old technologies, such as, Canadian tar sand carbon based syn-crude and Alberta-Texas trans-continental pipe line.

TI  - Patent Landscape Analysis in Carbon Dioxide Capture Technologies
AB  - CO2 sequestration is the process of capturing, transporting and storing CO2 from major emission sources. Alarming levels of CO2 in atmosphere are responsible for creating huge climate change and risks like global warming. To reduce CO2 and other greenhouse levels, world should shift to renewable resources. The Paris Agreement sets goal of reducing increase in temperature of earth which could be achieved by capturing and storage of CO2 in parallel of reducing use of fossil fuels for industries. The CO2 capturing methods are pre-combustion, post-combustion, etc., and storage sites are geological, ocean storage, industrial uses, etc. This chapter presents patent landscape analysis of CO2 capture technologies. Analysis includes patents filed in the field of carbon capture technologies worldwide and their geographical distribution, top countries, top assignees and top inventors in the world and India. It further discusses categorization of patents based on technology domain, commercialized products worldwide and Indian scenario.

TI  - Renewable biomethane from land and ocean energy crops and organic wastes
AB  - Production of methane via anaerobic digestion of energy crops and organic wastes would benefit society by providing a clean fuel from renewable feedstocks. This could replace fossil fuel-derived energy and reduce its environmental impacts, including global warming and acid rain. Although biomass energy is more costly than fossil fuel-derived energy, trends to limit carbon dioxide and other emissions through regulations, carbon taxes, and subsidies of biomass energy would make it cost competitive. Methane derived from anaerobic digestion is competitive in efficiencies and costs with other biomass energy forms including heat, synthesis gases, and ethanol. The objective of this paper is to review the results and conclusions of research on biomass energy conducted under the sponsorship of the gas industry with periodic co-funding from other agencies. The scope of this program was to determine the technical and economic feasibility of production of substitute natural gas (SNG) from marine and terrestrial biomass and organic wastes using anaerobic digestion as a conversion process. This work began in 1968 and continued until about 1990, ending as a result of low energy prices in the U.S. and reduced emphasis on renewable energy. For each of these feedstock categories, growth or collection (in the case of wastes), harvesting, conversion by anaerobic digestion, and systems and economic analysis were addressed. More recently the potential use of anaerobic digestion for stabilization and recovery of nutrients from solid wastes during space missions was studied with funding from NASA. The application of this process for that function as well as treatment of wastewater and waste gases generated during space missions is addressed.

TI  - Anaerobic digestion of microalgae as a necessary step to make microalgal biodiesel sustainable
AB  - The potential of microalgae as a source of biofuels and as a technological solution for CO2 fixation is subject to intense academic and industrial research. In the perspective of setting up massive cultures, the management of large quantities of residual biomass and the high amounts of fertilizers must be considered. Anaerobic digestion is a key process that can solve this waste issue as well as the economical and energetic balance of such a promising technology. Indeed, the conversion of algal biomass after lipid extraction into methane is a process that can recover more energy than the energy from the cell lipids. Three main bottlenecks are identified to digest microalgae. First, the biodegradability of microalgae can be low depending on both the biochemical composition and the nature of the cell wall. Then, the high cellular protein content results in ammonia release which can lead to potential toxicity. Finally, the presence of sodium for marine species can also affect the digester performance. Physico-chemical pretreatment, co-digestion, or control of gross composition are strategies that can significantly and efficiently increase the conversion yield of the algal organic matter into methane. When the cell lipid content does not exceed 40%, anaerobic digestion of the whole biomass appears to be the optimal strategy on an energy balance basis, for the energetic recovery of cell biomass. Lastly, the ability of these CO2 consuming microalgae to purify biogas and concentrate methane is discussed. Â© 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Electricity generation in Saudi Arabia: Tracing opportunities and challenges to reducing greenhouse gas emissions
AB  - The electrical energy demand of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has been observing a surging growth due to high population growth and urbanization rate. The generation mostly comes from the burning of petroleum products. The electricity sector emits more than one-third of the national greenhouse gas (GHG) of the country. Thus, it is essential to reduce the GHG from the electricity generation sector to maintain sustainability. This article mainly concentrates on the existing electricity generation and focuses on the Kingdom&#x2019;s GHG emissions mitigation initiatives. Although the use of natural gas and the number of cogeneration plants have been increased in electricity generation, the country has also been focusing on other initiatives, including the adaptation of combined cycle power plants, carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS), renewable and alternative energy sources, and various utility-scale energy efficiency measures. The ambitious and inspirational renewable energy (RE) targets of the Saudi Vision 2030 will significantly facilitate GHG emission avoidance, which will support the Kingdom to meet its Nationally Determined Contributions. This article recommends various mitigation measures, including the usage of the efficient internal combustion engine, poly-generation, combined heat and power (CHP) systems, deployment of renewable resources in the distribution and microgrid systems, bio-mass engine, and ocean thermal energy conversion plants. The decision-makers and the researchers will find the discussions and recommendations helpful in determining suitable and appropriate mitigation initiatives and technologies. CCBYNCND

TI  - Algal Turf Scrubbing: Cleaning Surface Waters with Solar Energy while Producing a Biofuel
AB  - As human populations have expanded, Earth's atmosphere and natural waters have become dumps for agricultural and industrial wastes. Remediation methods of the last half century have been largely unsuccessful. In many US watersheds, surface waters are eutrophic, and coastal water bodies, such as the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, have become increasingly hypoxic. The algal turf scrubber (ATS) is an engineered system for flowing pulsed wastewaters over sloping surfaces with attached, naturally seeded filamentous algae. This treatment has been demonstrated for tertiary sewage, farm wastes, streams, and large aquaculture systems; rates as large as 40 million to 80 million liters per day (lpd) are routine. Whole-river-cleaning systems of 12 billion lpd are in development. The algal biomass, produced at rates 5 to 10 times those of other types of land-based agriculture, can be fermented, and significant research and development efforts to produce ethanol, butanol, and methane are under way. Unlike with algal photobioreactor systems, the cost of producing biofuels from the cleaning of wastewaters by ATS can be quite low.

TI  - Design, testing, and operation of a completion deflector running and test tool for efficient multilateral completions
AB  - Trip optimization is essential in multilateral well construction, especially for extended-reach drilling (ERD) wells. This paper describes the design, testing, and operation of a completion deflector running and test tool (RTT) that was recently used during completion of one of the industry's deepest extended-reach multilateral wells. The RTT allows for running and pressure testing of a completion deflector and lower completion components in a single trip, thus saving at least one trip, and up to three trips. The challenge was to develop the capability to run a completion deflector with an existing pressure test tool. This was accomplished by converting the pressure test tool into a running tool. The new pressure actuated mechanism built into the tool releases the completion deflector automatically after a successful pressure test. A secondary release mechanism was also incorporated for contingency options. Extensive engineering qualification tests validated the new features to be highly reliable.

TI  - Assessing Mangrove Above-Ground Biomass and Structure using Terrestrial Laser Scanning: A Case Study in the Everglades National Park
AB  - Mangroves are among the ecosystems with the highest potential for carbon sequestration and storage. In these ecosystems and others above-ground biomass (AGB) is often used to estimate above-ground carbon content. We used a Leica-ScanStation-C10 Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) to estimate the volume and AGB of 40 mangrove trees distributed in three different mangrove sites located along Shark River Slough (SRS), in the western Everglades National Park. To estimate the volumetric shape of mangroves, we modeled stems as tapered geometrical surfaces called frustums of paraboloids and prop roots (Rhizophora mangle) as toroids and cylinders. AGB was estimated by multiplying the TLS-derived volume by wood specific density. Our TLS method for the SRS sites resulted in AGB estimates in the range of: 3.9 +/- 0.4 to 31.3 +/- 3.4 kg per tree in the short mangrove (< 5 m) site, 27.4 +/- 3.0 to 119.1 +/- 12.9 kg per tree in the intermediate (< 13 m) site and 52.1 +/- 6.7 to 1756.5 +/- 189.7 kg per tree in the tall (13-23 m) mangrove site. Our quantitative results: (1) enabled us to develop site-specific allometric relationships for tree diameter and AGB and (2) suggested that TLS is a promising alternative to destructive sampling.

TI  - Optimizations of the waste heat recovery system for a large marine diesel engine based on transcritical Rankine cycle
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the economic performance of the waste heat recovery (WHR) system for a marine diesel engine. Four waste heat sources, which are exhaust gas, cylinder cooling water, scavenge air cooling water and lubricating oil of a marine diesel engine, are first applied to drive the transcritical Rankine cycle (TRC). R1234yf, R1234ze, R134a, R152a, R236fa and R290 are employed in the system as working fluids. The effects of expander inlet pressure and temperature on net power output, thermal efficiency, total cost, mass flow rate, and available efficiency of the WHR system are analyzed. The levelized energy cost is used to evaluate the economic optimizations and their corresponding optimal parameters in the WHR system. The results show that the optimal levelized energy cost of R236fa is the most excellent and is lower than that of R1234ze, R134a, R152a, R1234yf or R290 by 5.07%, 6.25%, 7.42%, 9.77% or 12.11%, respectively. The payback period, fuel oil saving, and CO2 emission reduction are applied to assess the suitability of these working fluids. Furthermore, the economic optimization correlations in terms of dimensionless optimal pressures and temperature difference ratios are proposed for the system design of the optimal operating conditions.

TI  - Potential applications of nuisance microalgae blooms
AB  - Algal blooms have become a major concern in coastal areas and the great lakes of the world. Because of their various consequences for aquatic ecosystems and resources, algal blooms are called ``harmful algal blooms{''} (HABs). HABs often become severely detrimental when they involve one or more toxin-producing microalgae of various taxonomic origins. The accumulation of algal biomass also has deleterious effects on the ecological status of water. However, appropriate management strategies can allow the beneficial utilization of these events by consuming the biomass feedstock in the production of valuable biocommodities, including biofuels, functional food ingredients, UV-absorbing compounds, pharmaceutical products, etc. However, if the algal biomass can be harvested prior to the onset of their death phase, nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) can also be removed from the ecosystem by harvesting the algal blooms. Great progress has been made in the last decade in monitoring and predicting HABs, and a demand is emerging for persuasive postevent management policies that focus on the potential utilization of these blooms as natural renewable bioresources. This review summarizes various potential applications of nuisance algal blooms and the need for scientific research into their economic and industrial potential. Major algal products with great ecological and economic significance and their contemporary global utilization are analyzed.

TI  - Impacts of ocean acidification on marine fauna and ecosystem processes
AB  - Oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) is altering the seawater chemistry of the world's oceans with consequences for marine biota. Elevated partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) is causing the calcium carbonate saturation horizon to shoal in many regions, particularly in high latitudes and regions that intersect with pronounced hypoxic zones. The ability of marine animals, most importantly pteropod molluscs, foraminifera, and some benthic invertebrates, to produce calcareous skeletal structures is directly affected by seawater CO2 chemistry. CO2 influences the physiology of marine organisms as well through acid-base imbalance and reduced oxygen transport capacity. The few studies at relevant pCO2 levels impede our ability to predict future impacts on foodweb dynamics and other ecosystem processes. Here we present new observations, review available data, and identify priorities for future research, based on regions, ecosystems, taxa, and physiological processes believed to be most vulnerable to ocean acidification. We conclude that ocean acidification and the synergistic impacts of other anthropogenic stressors provide great potential for widespread changes to marine ecosystems.

TI  - Simulation research on combustion process in a natural gas-diesel dual-fuel marine engine
AB  - In order to solve the problem of Diesel natural gas dual fuel engine, such as power reduction, low charging efficiency, the conception of diesel engine fueled with pilot-ignited directly-injected liquefied natural gas is put forward. On the basis of this theory, a medium speed diesel of the ship is refitted into dual fuel engine, in order to keep original power, decrease the temperature of combustion and reduce emission. The LNG injection timing, duration of LNG injection and the different ratios the pilot diesel to total energy are studied the method of AVL FIRE software. Conclusions are as follows: When the different ratios pilot diesel to total energy is 0.5%, the engine can not work; Delaying the LNG injection timing, shortening the LNG injection duration and choose the right ratios pilot diesel to total energy can reach the indicated power of original machine, and the NOx emissions level will be greatly reduced.

TI  - HIGH INTEGRITY ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM OFFSHORE OIL \& GAS FACILITY
AB  - The electrical power generation and distribution system for one of the Platform (Platform `A') was designed different from earlier fixed drilling and production platforms in the North Sea. The main difference is that there is no dedicated emergency generator on board. Instead each of the three main generators has been upgraded to a standard normally associated with emergency sets. This provides higher reliability of the electrical supply system and enables essential consumers such as firewater pumps to be powered by electricity. The system known as the High Integrity Electrical Power System (HIEPS) was originally used at another platform in order to save diesel units for the combined Firewater/Seawater (FW/SW) pumps. The Platform `A' design went one step further. The design used combined FW/SW pumps (to eliminate two diesel driven FW pumps) and also eliminated two diesel driven emergency generators. This paper discusses details of objectives leading to this design 25 years back and analysis based on the operator experience whether those objectives were met or not.

TI  - High greenhouse gas emissions mitigation benefits from mangrove rehabilitation in Sulawesi, Indonesia
AB  - Mangroves have generated considerable interest in forest carbon discourse given their disproportionately high carbon storage and sequestration potential compared to terrestrial habitats. Capitalising on this potential, however, remains largely unrealised due in part to an incomplete understanding of the full greenhouse gas mitigation benefits provided, particularly through changes in landuse where aquaculture ponds are converted back to mangroves. Here we address such uncertainties by estimating the overall net greenhouse offset potential from rehabilitating mangroves in Tiwoho, North Sulawesi (Indonesia). Estimates of both baseline emissions and sequestration as mangrove forests regrow after rehabilitation were assessed, with results contrasted against published data on established mangroves and terrestrial forest carbon projects registered with the Verified Carbon Standard. Additionally, net emissions removals and reductions from Tiwoho is scaled-up to the national level in order to estimate the contribution rehabilitation of disused ponds can make to climate change mitigation. We also monetarise potential returns generated to date and frame this against project implementation and opportunity costs. Our data indicates that, on average, Tiwoho's rehabilitating sites could potentially mitigate upwards of -27.6 +/- 1.7 Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. This is upwards of 3 times that of other terrestrial forestry carbon projects and, assuming a voluntary carbon market price of USD \$8.1 per Mg CO2-e per hectare for afforestation/reforestation projects, equates to recuperation of 76.2\% of initial project implementation costs over approximately 10 years with an annual return of 7.6\%. This return rate rivals that of most asset classes targeted by private sector investors. Scaling results to encompass the net emissions removals and reduction potential from rehabilitating the similar to 600, 000 hectares of disused ponds in Indonesia may offset upwards of -16.56 +/- 1.02 million Mg CO2-e per hectare per year. Additionally, mitigation benefits from rehabilitation may equate to 6 times that of terrestrial projects if situated in ponds displaying both high baseline emissions and high rates of re-growth whilst accounting for sequestration from benthic algae and the oceanic burial of dissolved inorganic carbon. These findings strengthen the evidence base needed for public and private sector support for mangrove rehabilitation within the forest carbon sector.

TI  - Ocean acidification and ammonium enrichment interact to stimulate a short-term spike in growth rate of a bloom forming macroalga
AB  - IntroductionThe coastal macroalgal genus, Ulva, is found worldwide and is considered a nuisance algal genus due to its propensity for forming vast blooms. The response of Ulva to ocean acidification (OA) is of concern, particularly with nutrient enrichment, as these combined drivers may enhance algal blooms because of increased availability of dissolved inorganic resources. MethodsWe determined how a suite of physiological parameters were affected by OA and ammonium (NH4+) enrichment in 22-day laboratory experiments to gain a mechanistic understanding of growth, nutrient assimilation, and photosynthetic processes. We predicted how physiological parameters change across a range of pCO(2) and NH4+ scenarios to ascertain bloom potential under future climate change regimes. ResultsDuring the first five days of growth, there was a positive synergy between pCO(2) and NH4+ enrichment, which could accelerate initiation of an Ulva bloom. After day 5, growth rates declined overall and there was no effect of pCO(2), NH4+, nor their interaction. pCO(2) and NH4+ acted synergistically to increase NO3- uptake rates, which may have contributed to increased growth in the first five days. Under the saturating photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) used in this experiment (500 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)), maximum photosynthetic rates were negatively affected by increased pCO(2,) which could be due to increased sensitivity to light when high CO2 reduces energy requirements for inorganic carbon acquisition. Activity of CCMs decreased under high pCO(2) and high NH4+ conditions indicating that nutrients play a role in alleviating photodamage and regulating CCMs under high-light intensities. DiscussionThis study demonstrates that OA could play a role in initiating or enhancing Ulva blooms in a eutrophic environment and highlights the need for understanding the potential interactions among light, OA, and nutrient enrichment in regulating photosynthetic processes.

TI  - Potential of Deep Seawater Mariculture for Economic Transformation in Sabah, Malaysia
AB  - A Malaysian state of Sabah is blessed with natural deep sea water (DSW). The presence of these DSW's offers a potential for OTEC power plant to be installed and operated using warm surface sea water (SSW) as a heat source and the cold DSW as a heat sink. In the operation, the power plant may need to spend a considerable amount of power to pump up the DSW. The cold DSW, after serving its function as coolant to the condenser of the power plant, apparently appears as cold waste-water and may pose a disposal problem to the environment. However, being very rich in nutrients, the used DSW instead create another valuable potential for secondary commercial activities in industries like mariculture, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, medicinal, temperate crop farming, district cooling, etc. all of which, if fully developed could offer a real economic transformation for the state of Sabah, as that experience by the Japanese Kumejima of Okinawa prefecture. This paper focuses on the discussion on the potential of DSW in enhancing the development of Sabah mariculture industry, party contribution towards accelerating the socioeconomic transformation of the state and the people.

TI  - Three span floating suspension bridge crossing the BjÃ¸rnafjord
AB  - As part of the E39 fjord crossing project The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) performs a feasibility study for crossing the 5 km wide BjÃ¸rnafjord. One of three alternatives for the crossing is a multi-span suspension bridge on floating foundations. The suspension bridge consists of three main spans at 1385 meters each. The superstructure is supported by two land based pylons and two floaters midfjord. The design of the floaters are based on known tension leg platform (TLP) technology from the offshore industry that has proven to be an effective concept for floating constructions at large water depths. The fjord has a depth of up to 550 m, and the seabed is dominated by marine clay in the anchor areas. These conditions are ideal for a TLP solution with anchors combining gravitational and suction abilities. The main concerns for a multispan suspension bridge of this type are addressed to dynamic response induced by environmental loads, such as wind, wave and current, and the ability to withstand accidental loads, such as ship collision. Initial analyses of the TLP concept have shown it is a feasible alternative for crossing the BjÃ¸rnafjord, and that the structure should cope with the load conditions for the site.

TI  - Estimation of Anthropogenic CO2 Inventories in the Ocean
AB  - A significant impetus for recent ocean biogeochemical research has been to better understand the ocean's role as a sink for anthropogenic CO2. In the 1990s the global carbon survey of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) inspired the development of several approaches for estimating anthropogenic carbon inventories in the ocean interior. Most approaches agree that the total global ocean inventory of C-ant was around 120 Pg C in the mid-1990s. Today, the ocean carbon uptake rate estimates suggest that the ocean is not keeping pace with the CO2 emissions growth rate. Repeat occupations of the WOCE/JGOFS survey lines consistently show increases in carbon inventories over the last decade, but have not yet been synthesized enough to verify a slowdown in die carbon storage rate. There are many uncertainties in the future ocean carbon storage. Continued observations are necessary to monitor changes and understand mechanisms controlling ocean carbon uptake and storage in the future.

TI  - Plant protein-based feeds and commercial feed enable isotopic tracking of aquaculture emissions into marine macrozoobenthic bioindicator species
AB  - Brittle stars (Ophiura spp.) and other benthic macrofauna were collected in a prospective mariculture area in the North Sea to determine if these taxa could be used as indicator species to track nutrients released from future offshore aquaculture sites. We analysed natural carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic signatures in tissues from macrofauna and compared these to six feed ingredients and four experimental diets made thereof, as well as to a commercial feed with and without lipid and carbonate removal. Our data suggest practicability of using isotopic signatures of Ophiura spp. to track aquaculture-derived organic material if plant-based fish diet ingredients and commercial feed were used for fish farming in the German Exclusive Economic Zone. Diets with high fish meal content would not be detected in Ophiura spp. using isotopic measures due to the similarity with the marine background. Our data provide valuable baseline information for studies on the impact of offshore aquaculture on the marine environment. Â© 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Design and optimisation of an advanced waste heat cascade utilisation system for a large marine diesel engine
AB  - Growing energy shortages severely restricting the sustainable development of human beings, improving energy efficiency has become an urgent issue. To improve energy efficiency, the dual-pressure organic Rankine cycle, which is an efficient waste heat recovery technique for ships, has received increasing attention. Most researchers have investigated the dual-pressure organic Rankine cycle with pure working fluids, which do not yield the best thermodynamic and economic performance. In addition, some low-grade waste heat sources in the engine have been neglected. To completely recover the waste heat energy of marine engines, a novel waste heat recovery technique with a dual-pressure organic Rankine cycle system, desalination plant, and two-bed regenerative adsorption refrigeration device is presented for recovering residual heat from the exhaust gas, jacket water, charge air, and lubricating oil. Based on a comparison of the thermodynamic performance, safety, and environmental effects, the zeotropic working fluid pair dimethyl carbonate/perfluoropropane is selected. The mathematical model of the proposed integrated system is evaluated to ensure accuracy, and its critical parameters are analysed based on its thermodynamic and economic performance. A multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm is adopted to optimise the system. The results show that the proposed integrated system can recover 354.65 kW net power and increase the thermal efficiency by 4.2\% on average; at the most frequently used engine load, a refrigeration capacity of 88 kW and a fresh water rate of 146 kg/h are achieved. This work promotes the development of the energy recycling. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Geodatabase design for streamlining geohazard site characterization
AB  - This paper presents an overview of a Geographic Information System (GIS) geodatabase design that is optimized to organize data and increase efficiency in geohazard site characterization and risk assessment. Specifically, the paper: describes the geodatabase framework; highlights useful datasets and how they are organized; demonstrates geodatabase implementation into a risk assessment workflow; and gives a qualitative assessment of increased efficiency compared to non-GIS based approaches. This geodatabase application demonstrates the improvements realized in accessing, organizing, and visualizing relevant data to improve the understanding of geologic conditions before and during site investigation (e.g. well-site clearance, facility siting, pipeline route selection, etc.). It is also used to optimize data retrieval, to characterize the regional to site-specific geological conditions, and to help identify areas where data gaps occur which may require additional investigation. We present a case study illustrating the development of an Alaska offshore geodatabase, which allows easy access to data that would otherwise be housed in multiple storage locations and formats. The geodatabase can query a multitude of public and proprietary data to understand the regional and site-specific geologic conditions. Because considerable thought and time were taken up front to organize data, end-users are able to quickly access data that might have otherwise taken valuable time to compile. This approach provides a vast improvement over site investigations where the geoscientist had to comb through multiple sources and illustrates the need for data to be housed in a framework where data is easily accessible. The geodatabase creation was made possible by methodical investigation of available data and best-practice organization. Use of integrated geodatabases will continue to increase efficiency in the areas of data retrieval, organization, utilization, and assessment in the face of ballooning volumes of data. This approach to quick and easy access saves time while making the data more likely to be used, all leading to a more complete and accurate geohazard assessment.

TI  - A low-power water quality monitoring system and prediction model
AB  - A low-power water quality monitoring system is proposed to promote the development of offshore aquaculture informatization and realize intelligent monitoring of the offshore aquaculture environments. The STM32F103C8T6 controller is used to collect information such as light, temperature, humidity, and pH at regular intervals, and transmit the data to the cloud monitoring platform through LoRa+5G technology to realize remote monitoring of multi-area environmental information. An improved K-GRU prediction model is established by combining deep learning and an improved K-means clustering algorithm. The model to PCA algorithm and K-means clustering algorithm to achieve the selection of water quality key parameters, and its data as the output of the network input module; based on this input to the noise reduction module for noise reduction processing, the noise reduction data input to the network learning module for training and learning, the use of cross-validation and network search method to optimize the network parameters and structure, the trained prediction model predicts the key parameters of water quality. The accuracy and reliability of the system's marine environmental information collection and the effectiveness of the water quality key parameter prediction models are verified by example. Compared with the traditional K-GRU prediction model, RMSE is reduced by 5.6\%, MAPE is reduced by 10.9\%, and R2 is improved by 0.94\%, which can meet the practical needs of offshore aquaculture water quality monitoring and prediction.

TI  - Sea urchins in a high CO2 world: Impacts of climate warming and ocean acidification across life history stages
AB  - Uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) is changing seawater chemistry (ocean acidification) causing a reduction in seawater pH and saturation state (Î©) of the CaCO3 minerals needed for calcification and increased organism hypercapnia (pCO2). Ocean acidification and global warming are having negative impacts on sea urchin larvae and adults. As sea urchins calcify in both these life stages, they have been used as a model group to investigate the impacts of climate change on marine species. In general, near-future acidification has a stunting effect on sea urchin growth as seen in smaller larval and adult skeletons, a change largely caused by energetic constraints and reduced Î©. These effects can be reduced by moderate warming and sufficient food supply. Variation in the response to acidification and/or warming within and between species indicates that there is capacity for phenotypic plasticity to adjust to changing climate. The presence of sea urchin populations at naturally acidified habitats indicates resilience to acidification and highlights species-specific and biological system adaptive strategies to life at low pH. We need to identify the sea urchin species that are resilient and their phenotypic plastic responses or genetic adaptations to climatic stressors to understand the echinoid fauna of the future.

TI  - The air-water CO2 exchange of a coastal sea-A sensitivity study on factors that influence the absorption and outgassing of CO2 in the Baltic Sea
AB  - In this study, the BALTSEM model is used to estimate how air-water CO2 fluxes in the Baltic Sea respond to parameterizations of organic alkalinity (Aorg), gas transfer, and phytoplankton growth, and further to changes in river loads. The forcing data include the most complete compilation of Baltic river loads for dissolved inorganic and organic carbon (DIC and DOC) and total alkalinity (TA). In addition, we apply the most recent estimates of internal TA generation in the system. Our results clearly demonstrate how air-water CO2 fluxes of a coastal sea depend on river loads of carbon, TA, and nutrients as well the freshwater import itself. Long-term changes in DIC loads are shown to be compensated by corresponding changes in air-water CO2 exchange. By adding Aorg, a discrepancy in the carbonate system calculations was removed, and the simulated net CO2 absorption of the system decreased by 11\%. A new parameterization for cyanobacteria growth significantly improved the seasonal development of pCO(2) in the central Baltic Sea, although the net effect on CO2 fluxes was below 5\%. By applying either a linear, quadratic, or cubic wind speed dependence for gas transfer, the long-term net CO2 exchange was adjusted by less than 5\%. There is no clear indication that any one of these parameterizations provides a more accurate estimate of CO (2) fluxes than the other two. Our findings are applicable in other coastal areas that are heavily influenced by river loads of TA, DIC, and DOC.

TI  - PREVENTING SALT INTRUSION THROUGH SHIPPING LOCKS: RECENT INNOVATIONS AND RESULTS FROM A PILOT SETUP
AB  - At many locations, freshwater canals and reservoirs are connected to the sea or estuary by shipping locks. With every passage of a vessel, a lock transports saltwater into the freshwater area, affecting the water quality for consumption, agriculture or industrial application. As a result of climate change, with increased periods of drought, freshwater is becoming increasingly scarce while economic development increases the demand for fresh water. For this reason it is becoming more important to reduce salt intrusion through shipping locks. In the Netherlands there are 23 navigational locks at fresh/saltwater interfaces, of which at present only the Krammer locks have a fully operational salt intrusion prevention system. The current system however is complex, expensive to build and maintain, requires a lot of space and increases locking time significantly. For these reasons this technique is not suitable for implementation at existing locks. An alternative system is sought with a similar level of effectiveness, but without the demands in space, time and costs. One of the traditional ways of preventing salt intrusion is the application of air bubble screens, also known as pneumatic barriers, in the lock heads. Taking this as a starting point, a highly effective combination of measures has been developed, using lab experiments, numerical simulations and field experiments. The new system, referred to as the Delta Salt Barrier System, includes improved air bubble screens, combined with freshwater injection, sills and freshwater flushing of the lock. Also, a computational tool has been developed to predict the salt intrusion for the specific site, conditions and operation. The new system has recently been tested in prototype. For one of the recreational locks at the Krammer lock complex, a pilot installation has been designed and built which has been in operation during the summer of 2014. Measurements have been taken to establish the salt intrusion using different combinations of measures. In general the measures performed as expected, although some new insights were gained as well. Furthermore the pilot has provided important experience on the operational aspects. Supported by the results of the pilot project, it has been concluded that application of the Delta Salt Barrier System would be an attractive alternative for maintenance of the existing system on the Krammer locks.

TI  - Impact of elevated CO2 concentrations on carbonate mineral precipitation ability of sulfate-reducing bacteria and implications for CO2 sequestration
AB  - Interest in anthropogenic CO2 release and associated global climatic change has prompted numerous laboratory-scale and commercial efforts focused on capturing, sequestering or utilizing CO2 in the subsurface. Known carbonate mineral precipitating microorganisms, such as the anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), could enhance the rate of conversion of CO2 into solid minerals and thereby improve longterm storage of captured gasses. The ability of SRB to induce carbonate mineral precipitation, when exposed to atmospheric and elevated pCO(2), was investigated in laboratory scale tests with bacteria from organic-rich sediments collected from hypersaline Lake Estancia, New Mexico. The enriched SRB culture was inoculated in continuous gas flow and batch reactors under variable headspace pCO(2) (0.0059 psi to 20 psi). Solution pH, redox conditions, sulfide, calcium and magnesium concentrations were monitored in the reactors. Those reactors containing SRB that were exposed to pCO(2) of 14.7 psi or less showed Mg-calcite precipitation. Reactors exposed to 20 psi pCO(2) did not exhibit any carbonate mineralization, likely due to the inhibition of bacterial metabolism caused by the high levels of CO2. Hydrogen, lactate and formate served as suitable electron donors for the SRB metabolism and related carbonate mineralization. Carbon isotopic studies confirmed that similar to 53\% of carbon in the precipitated carbonate minerals was derived from the CO2 headspace, with the remaining carbon being derived from the organic electron donors, and the bicarbonate ions available in the liquid medium. The ability of halotolerant SRB to induce the precipitation of carbonate minerals can potentially be applied to the long-term storage of anthropogenic CO2 in saline aquifers and other ideal subsurface rock units by converting the gas into solid immobile phases.

TI  - Requalification of an older California platform: API and risk-based approaches
AB  - An aging infrastructure of oil and gas facilities in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore the West coast poses structural risk management issues. These issues are compounded, firstly, by enhanced drilling, recovery and operational techniques which tend to prolong the economic life of the field and hence the required service life of the platform; secondly, by uncertainties associated with the present condition of these structures; and thirdly, by a heightened sensitivity to safety within the industry. This paper briefly discusses the evolving efforts by industry and regulatory agencies to address these concerns, in terms of establishing assessment procedures and performance criteria for aging facilities. The paper describes, by way of illustration, the requalification efforts on one 25 year old West coast platform. A planned waterflood operation will extend the platform's service life by at least 20 years. The merits and disadvantages of two assessment procedures used to establish the upgrading necessary for continued safe operations on this platform are discussed. Explicit risk acceptance criteria are not addressed. This paper addresses risk posed by structural failure only. Risks from human, organizational and other errors are not addressed. It is recognized that these are a greater source of risk than that associated with structural failure. Copyright 1991, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Paradigm shift in downhole sand control; The first installation of shape memory polymer as an alternative to gravel packing at bs field, offshore Malaysia
AB  - Objectives/Scope: Controlling sand has been one of the most difficult challenges in oil production in Upstream Malaysia operations. Conventionally, Cased Hole Gravel Packs (CHGP) or Open Hole Gravel Packs (OHGP) are installed to prevent sand from being produced with the oil to the surface facilities. However, both methods require massive operations and high cost which impact the overall economics of the project. Methods, Procedures, Process: This paper summarizes the technology evaluation of Shape Memory Polymer (SMP). This includes the working philosophies, candidate selection, risk identification and mitigation plan, and success criteria developed for this technology. Common gravel packing technique is accomplished by packing gravel in the annulus between the screen and formation sand face, where the gravel acts as a barrier preventing the migration of the formation sand. The new technology does exactly the same task by expanding SMP which conforms to the sand face. The only difference, in gravel packing, the contact medium with the sand face is the gravel whereas in this technology the contact medium is the SMP. The operational sequence is very similar to the installation of Open Hole Stand Alone Screens (OHSAS). From the evaluation, one well was identified by the team at BS field for piloting this technology. The well will be part of a development campaign executed in Q2 2020. Details of the well design and scope will be shared briefly, as well as a commercial comparison between conventional sand control methods and SMP. Results, Observations, Conclusions: The pilot test at BS field will be discussed including technology evaluation, candidate selection, well completion design, risk mitigation and others. Several case histories and current available field implementation are also taken into consideration to properly plan the pilot test. The success criteria outlined would help to oversee the performance and continuous monitoring of the system before it can be declared a success. Potential candidates for replication of this technology have also been identified within the Operator's company in the near future. Novel/Additive Information: The possible pilot test for this technology is the result of strong and good collaboration between the Operator and Service Company. If it is a proven success, this technology will become a game changer for downhole sand control in the petroleum industry which will be able to maximize production and save operational expenditures, while ensuring the highest reliability.

TI  - Innovative uses of wave power: Environmental management of the port of Ensenada, Mexico
AB  - Over the past century, the water and sediments of the port of Ensenada, MÃ©xico, have accumulated a lot of pollution from human activities. Although present day restrictive measures inhibit any further accumulation, the existing aggregation in the sediments is sufficient to maintain high levels of contamination throughout the port, despite the flushing action of the tides. A SIBEO (SIBEO is an acronym for the Spanish SIstema de Bombeo por Energ acia de Oleaje) wave-driven seawater pump recently developed at the National University of Mexico is proposed to inject clean and oxygen rich seawater from outside the port to promote flushing in the more stagnant sections of the harbour. Results from a numerical model of the port hydrodynamics shed light on why the tides cannot on their own adequately flush the system, and how the wave-driven seawater pump will help to promote ventilation. Over the next 4 years, a cluster of SIBEO pumps is proposed to be installed on the Ensenada breakwater to inject unpolluted seawater at various locations in the port. A programme will be carried out to study the effects on the water column and sediments, in this first full-scale application of the SIBEO.

TI  - Petrobras approach to FPSO cost reduction
AB  - The standardization process was initiated nearly a decade ago under a thriving scene of the oil industry. At that time, Petrobras had already had a long experience designing, contracting and participating in offshore production units. This vast experience showed that eventual optimization obtained with tailor made solutions tended to lose attractivity, regarding schedules and costs, when compared with identical projects. This perception motivated a movement towards standardization and a radical change in design philosophy. This initiative has proven to be applicable to a wide range of crudes and several units have been contracted since. The first standardized projects developed by Petrobras, were the P-58 and P-62 FPSOs, two similar units to operate at Baleia Azul and Roncador fields, respectively. These units are operating with very good results. Since then, eight "Replicants" were contracted to Brazilian shipyards and the first unit should be producing next year. Despite the success of standardization, in current scenario of cost reduction, incrementing the capacity of new FPSO units is a major option to be evaluated. In this context, this paper will present Petrobras strategy towards EPC of its FPSOs and how cost reduction is planned. Future trends will also be discussed.

TI  - Onboard screening of forecast weather during installation
AB  - Pipelines and umbilical are key elements in subsea infrastructure for energy transport. Offshore installation of long pipelines and umbilicais on uneven seabeds in deep waters are critical operations. Uncertainties in weather conditions and currents add to the challenge. During the planning of an installation, many detailed static and dynamic analyses are performed in order to determine the weather conditions under which the operation may take place: the operational weather window. Weather windows may either be established for the whole operation, or different weather windows may be established for different phases of the operation, e.g., depending on water depth, bottom conditions or prevailing current along the route. To allow these weather windows to be established, representative conditions must be chosen for each part of the route. If the weather deteriorates during the operation so that forecasted weather conditions are not within the weather window, the operation must be halted until the weather conditions improve. Considering the day rates for laying barges, the increased costs may be significant. A delay may also be detrimental to the total project. An alternative is to base the decision to proceed or halt on updated analyses at the present location. The correct water depth, soil characteristics, local seafloor geometry and possible free spans in the laid pipeline may thus all be included in the analyses along with the most up-to-date weather and current forecasts. The most correct estimate of the response will then be available as a basis for the decision to continue or halt the operation. Other "what if scenarios may also be investigated; e,g., allowing the operator to explore the effect of changed operation or deviations from the predicted weather. Estimates of fatigue damage rates may be used to evaluate continued operation in deteriorating conditions. A system for onboard screening of forecast weather condition is presented along with examples from a prototype application. Using knowledge of the system, the extent of nonlinear simulations is limited to where they will give the most contribution to the extreme response in the forecasted conditions.

TI  - Bioethanol potentials from marine residual biomass: an Emergy evaluation
AB  - Different types and sources of biofuels were recently studied as potential energy issues. The aim of this work is to evaluate the use of new kinds of renewable and alternative feedstocks for producing bioethanol. In particular, the potential production of bioethanol from cellulosic material was analyzed considering two species of macroalgae (C. linum, G. longissima) as residual biomass from an eutrophic lagoon system. Besides chemical analyses and the evaluation of yields in producing bioethanol, accounting methods are necessary to understand the level of sustainability of the whole production process exploiting natural resources. An assessment was carried out based on the emergy approach, in order to evaluate the environmental performance of processes in the case study. Results showed that macroalgae are a good candidate for bioethanol production even if bioethanol conversion from macroalgae biomass was found to be not very efficient per se. Nevertheless, the feedstock may be involved in processes of biorefinery in systems with a high carbohydrate content, in which heat necessary to treat the feedstock and maintain the micro organisms performing the transformation are provided by external sources already existing (e.g. a combined heat and power plant).

TI  - Gas centrifugal compressor: Pushing its capacity limit via surge control & polytrophic efficiency operating point optimization, driven gas turbine fuel Savings
AB  - In many offshore oil and gas installations, the gas compressors are directly driven by the gas turbines which uses fuel gas that can be monetized if the gas turbines fuel gas consumption is reduced; both from operating the compressors at higher efficiency and optimized compressor operating envelope to operate as close to surge region, thus avoiding gas recycling at the compressor. This paper shows every molecule savings on the fuel gas consumption can derive substantial commercial value for the end users. The presenter list prerequisites for the gas compressor operating points optimization and surge control optimization. The methods used will guide end users to operate multiple gas compressors by taking advantage of their best efficiency operating points based on either polytrophic or isentrophic efficiency calculated. Simple algorithm and easy to measure parameters from the field to derive the monetized values of the fuel savings to see if it is worth to adjust the operating points can be determined. The incipient surge test can be conducted to determine the surge region to ensure we operate the compressors without gas recycling which is waste of energy during capacity turndown for the compressor, thus this also yields return on investment. By operating the compressor at better efficiency points, the compressor absorbs lesser brake horsepower (bhp) or shaft power, in turn, the gas turbines fuel is consumed at optimized flowrate, resulting in reduction of fuel gas that can be monetized instead of being burned in combustion chamber of the gas turbine and emitted as Green House Gas (GHG) from the gas turbine exhaust stacks. Operating the gas turbine efficiently means we are truly embarking on GREENER environment, not just by words but this is also a practical way to embrace Paris climate change initiatives. The Paris Agreement, Paris climate accord or Paris climate agreement is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change dealing with greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. It is also common that we recycle gas to avoid surging the compressors for low flowrate scenarios in our compression operations which is an inefficient way of compression as recycling gas means energy is wasted by compressing gas then its pressure is killed via capacity recycle or anti surge control valve which in turn dissipates as heat and noise during gas recycling. Therefore, one of the desired solution is to push compressors closest to the surge region by conducting incipient surge test at site conditions to define the actual surge boundary, allowing the compressor to operate without recycling at lower flowrates, thus recycling is minimized or/and some cases avoided. This paper presents the incipient surge test done offshore with risk mitigated whilst some OEM's do not recommend this test. The author has personally conducted such test offshore, and presents risks and values proposition for end users. Â© 2018 Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Decarbonization of Marine Fuels-The Future of Shipping
AB  - The goal of reducing the climate impact of shipping requires many different activities. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the International Maritime Organization prepared some proposals to meet and fulfill the requirements. It sets out the provisions of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 73/78 Annex 6-Prevention of the Air Pollution from Ships (1997) with the amendments and the future objectives set. The main objective is to achieve climate neutrality from shipping by 2050. One method is the decarbonization of marine fuels. The types of fuels that are transient fuels, with the final target fuel being hydrogen, are shown. Carbon dioxide emissions depend on the chemical composition of the fuel, its Lower Heating Value and the engine efficiency. The aim of the manuscript is to demonstrate that the use of fuels with lower carbon content is a transitional process enabling the hydrogen era to take place. An analysis of this problem is presented as a review of the subject along with the author's comments and observations. The development of technologies for adapting potential fuels to combustion requirements in marine diesel engines and gas turbines, together with their storage and bunkering capabilities, are the main barriers to their limited use. The efficiency of marine diesel engines reaches a value of about 50\%, while that of fuel cells are close to 100\%. It seems that hydrogen will be the fuel of the future, including in shipping. Its basic use is in fuel cells, the efficiency of which is almost twice that of current thermal internal combustion engines.

This study performed an energy and GHG emissions analysis, using EROI and GHG savings potential respectively, as indicators of commercial viability for two systems: the Swedish Seafarm project's seaweed cultivation (0.5 ha), biogas and fertilizer biorefinery, and an estimation of the same system scaled up and adjusted to a cultivation of 10 ha. Based on a conservative estimate of biogas yield, neither the 0.5 ha case nor the up-scaled 10 ha estimates met the (commercial viability) target EROI of 3, nor the European Union Renewable Energy Directive GHG savings target of 60\% for biofuels, however the potential for commercial viability was substantially improved by scaling up operations: GHG emissions and energy demand, per unit of biogas, was almost halved by scaling operations up by a factor of twenty, thereby approaching the EROI and GHG savings targets set, under beneficial biogas production conditions. Further analysis identified processes whose optimisations would have a large impact on energy use and emissions (such as anaerobic digestion) as well as others embodying potential for further economies of scale (such as harvesting), both of which would be of interest for future developments of kelp to biogas and fertilizer biorefineries.

TI  - Global Extreme Strength Analysis on Specialized Hang-off Joint System for Deepwater Drilling Riser
AB  - Offshore drilling activates have been significantly impacted by severe weather conditions as oil and gas development has moved into deeper water. Under the situation of imminent arrival of a typhoon, emergency retrieval of the whole drilling riser string is time consuming and tedious. A specialized soft hang-off system to improve the adaptability of the drilling riser system under hang-off operations is developed to solve the low-efficiency and time limitation for retrieval all drilling riser joints during in extreme storm environment. By using the hang-off joint and hydraulic compensation systems, the device can perform the dynamic compensation of the riser during typhoon and improve the moonpool interference performance, so as to greatly improve the safety of drilling riser during typhoon period, and can be applied in transit during cross-wells operation with a relatively higher transit speed. Global extreme strength analysis on deepwater drilling riser hang-off joint system in hang-off operation during extreme storm environment is conducted to confirm the proposed design of the hang-off system. The various wave and current load, hang-off length, hang-off arrangement under different stroke positions (top, middle and bottom) are considered in the global strength analysis and results discussion is conducted. The novel concept and system provide safety guarantee during deepwater drilling operations and is an important emergency equipment for anti-typhoon.

TI  - A reversible solid oxide fuel cell energy storage system
AB  - Renewable energy provides the best means of combating CO2 emissions, which contribute to global warming. However most renewable forms of energy are intermittent, such as wind or offshore wave, or diurnal, such as solar or tidal. As the electricity is not necessarily generated when required, there needs to be some form of storage or load levelling. This can be the grid, but most networks can typically only tolerate 10-20% of a intermittent supply and for non-grid connected locations there needs some form of local storage. A fuel cell coupled with an electrolyser can act as an energy storage device. The use of high temperature fuel cells also allows the waste heat to be exploited if required, raising the efficiency of the system. Typically the hydrogen is produced in an electrolyser from excess electric production, and compressed into storage tanks. The stored hydrogen can then be fed into a fuel cell when more energy is needed than is being generated. The clean water supply for the electrolyser, compressors, regulators, sensors and valves add considerably to the balance of plant and so to the cost. These active components use power and so lower the efficiency, and also add complexity to the system which will reduce the time before failure of the system. A prototype reversible solid oxide fuel cell system, consisting of both electrolyser and fuel cell, with greatly reduced balance of plant will be described and discussed. This system will be cheaper and more robust and will be ideal for connecting to the slowly changing output of diurnal power sources.

TI  - Prospects for the role of magnesium in solar-hydrogen energy-system
AB  - It is most common to talk about energy systems that would utilize solar energy to split water to produce hydrogen. This way, solar energy has been stored in the form of hydrogen, being an ideal energy-carrier. However we are still facing the problem of how to store and transport hydrogen to end users? The overall scope of the proposed energy scheme involves using solar to vaporize a dynamic stream of pre-concentrated sea water (brine) flowing along an inclined Preferential Salt Separator (P.S.S.). This evaporation process takes place by direct solar radiation or by using a heating system powered by a photovoltaic source. Magnesium chloride salts soluble in sea water, will separate as end product. Fresh water will be produced as a byproduct as well. Anhydrous magnesium chloride is collected and then electrolyzed next to produce magnesium metal using energy generated by solar power. Once produced, magnesium represents a reliable source of stored energy that could be exported by air, sea or other means of transportation to remote locations for power-generation. Magnesium is used on site, to construct a galvanic cell that consists of magnesium/iron electrodes generating electricity. Water introduced to the cell is electrolyzed to produce hydrogen. Another option is to use magnesium as a storage-medium to store hydrogen in the form of magnesium hydride. Copyright Â© 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Molecular response of Sargassum vulgare to acidification at volcanic CO2 vents: Insights from proteomic and metabolite analyses
AB  - Ocean acidification is impacting marine life all over the world. Understanding how species can cope with the changes in seawater carbonate chemistry represents a challenging issue. We addressed this topic using underwater CO2 vents that naturally acidify some marine areas off the island of Ischia. In the most acidified area of the vents, having a mean pH value of 6.7, comparable to far-future predicted acidification scenarios (by 2300), the biomass is dominated by the brown alga Sargassum vulgare. The novelty of the present study is the characterization of the S. vulgare proteome together with metabolite analyses to identify the key proteins, metabolites, and pathways affected by ocean acidification. A total of 367 and 387 proteins were identified in populations grown at pH that approximates the current global average (8.1) and acidified sites, respectively. Analysis of their relative abundance revealed that 304 proteins are present in samples from both sites: 111 proteins are either higher or exclusively present under acidified conditions, whereas 120 proteins are either lower or present only under control conditions. Functionally, under acidification, a decrease in proteins related to translation and post-translational processes and an increase of proteins involved in photosynthesis, glycolysis, oxidation-reduction processes, and protein folding were observed. In addition, small-molecule metabolism was affected, leading to a decrease of some fatty acids and antioxidant compounds under acidification. Overall, the results obtained by proteins and metabolites analyses, integrated with previous transcriptomic, physiological, and biochemical studies, allowed us to delineate the molecular strategies adopted by S. vulgare to grow in future acidified environments, including an increase of proteins involved in energetic metabolism, oxidation-reduction processes, and protein folding at the expense of proteins involved in translation and post-translational processes.
