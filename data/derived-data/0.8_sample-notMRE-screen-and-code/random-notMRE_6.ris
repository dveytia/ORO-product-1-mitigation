TI  - CO2 ocean sequestration by moving ships
AB  - Ocean sequestration of the CO2 captured from fossil-fuel burning is a possible option to mitigate the increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. It can isolate huge amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere for a long time at relatively low cost, if it is acceptable from the viewpoint of the environmental impact on the ocean. The concept of CO2 dispersion in the ocean depths by ships is a promising method for efficient dilution. That is, liquefied CO2 is delivered to the site and injected into the ocean at depths of 1000-2500m with a suspended pipe towed by a slowly moving ship. In addition to the horizontal movement of the release point, the vertical journey of CO2 droplets until they disappear by dissolution is effective for the dilution of CO2 in seawater. In this paper, the possibility of the generation of relatively large-sized droplets from a moving nozzle is investigated experimentally. In addition, the terminal velocity of CO2 droplets in deep-sea circumstances is measured in a large high-pressure tank to investigate the influence of the hydrate film formed on the surface of the droplet. Finally, it is shown by simulation that an initial dilution ratio of one to some ten thousandths is possible on a realistic engineering scale in the moving ship type of CO2 ocean sequestration.

TI  - Biomass production of marine microalga Tetraselmis suecica using biogas and wastewater as nutrients
AB  - Anaerobic digestion is a suitable method for treating organic wastes and generating biogas. This biogas contains significant amount of CO2 and some other contaminants. The coupling of wastewater treatment with biogas purification using saline microalgae could effectively upgrade biogas (through photosynthetic CO2 fixation) and concurrently remove nutrients from the effluent, while producing valuable algal biomass. In this context, Tetraselmis suecica biomass production with the use of an impurity (CO2) in biogas to supply carbon, and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from anaerobically-digested piggery effluent (ADPE) was investigated at four operating pH set points (6.5, 7.5, 8.5 and 9.5). Results showed that pH 7.5 produced the optimum conditions for T. suecica growth and biogas-based CO2 removal, with the maximum biomass (59.8 mg L-1 d(-1)), lipid (25 mg L-1 d(-1)) and carbohydrate (6.5 mg L-1 d(-1)) productivities. Under this condition, CO2, total nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies were 94.7\%, 96\% and 72\%, respectively. Furthermore, the results showed no inhibitory effect of dissolved CH4 on the growth of T. suecica at pH 7.5, suggesting the technical feasibility of harnessing marine T. suecica for simultaneous nutrients removal from wastewaters, biogas upgrading, and production of energy-rich algal biomass. This process clearly harnesses anaerobically-digested piggery effluent not only as an asset but also uses an impurity (CO2) in biogas to produce valuable algal biomass.

TI  - Variability and Vulnerability of Coastal `Blue Carbon' Stocks: A Case Study from Southeast Australia
AB  - `Blue carbon' ecosystems-seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves-serve as dense carbon sinks important for reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, yet only recently have stock estimates emerged. We sampled 96 blue carbon ecosystems across the Victorian coastline (southeast Australia) to quantify total sediment stocks, variability across spatial scales, and estimate emissions associated with historical ecosystem loss. Mean sediment organic carbon (C-org) stock (+/- SE) to a depth of 30 cm was not significantly different between tidal marshes (87.1 +/- 4.90 Mg C-org ha(-1)) and mangroves (65.6 +/- 4.17 Mg C-org ha(-1)), but was significantly lower in seagrasses (24.3 +/- 1.82 Mg C-org ha(-1)). Location (defined as an individual meadow, marsh, or forest) had a stronger relationship with C-org stock than catchment region, suggesting local-scale conditions drive variability of stocks more than regional-scale processes. We estimate over 2.90 million +/- 199,000 Mg C-org in the top 30 cm of blue carbon sediments in Victoria (53\% in tidal marshes, 36\% in seagrasses, and 11\% in mangroves) and sequestration rates of 22,700 +/- 5510 Mg C-org year(-1) (valued at over \$AUD1 million +/- 245,000 year(-1) based on the average price of \$AUD12.14 Mg CO2 eq(-1) at Australian Emissions Reduction Fund auctions). We estimate ecosystem loss since European settlement may equate to emissions as high as 4.83 million +/- 358,000 Mg CO2 equivalents (assuming 90\% remineralization of stocks), 98\% of which was associated with tidal marsh loss, and what would have been sequestering 9360 +/- 2500 Mg C-org year(-1). This study is among the first to present a comprehensive comparison of sediment stocks across and within coastal blue carbon ecosystems. We estimate substantial and valuable carbon stocks associated with these ecosystems that have suffered considerable losses in the past and need protection into the future to maintain their role as carbon sinks.

TI  - Power at sea: Use of wave energy converters for powering offshore oil and gas operations
AB  - New innovative services and goods based on artificial intelligence, next-generation robotics, autonomy, digitization, and electrification are taking root in the ocean economy. More typical competitive forces, such as value enhancement and safety improvement, are also present, as suppliers constantly strive to improve their competitive positioning. Concurrently, the Oil and Gas sector is experiencing mounting pressure to decrease its operational carbon emissions, forcing efforts to reduce or eliminate liquid fuel consumption offshore.Companies in the ocean economy are having to react to this combination of macro- A nd micro-level drivers and innovate at an ever more rapid pace. However, before many of these new capabilities can be implemented, new, clean, reliable power sources are needed, especially as liquid fuel grows increasingly out of favor. For many of these loads-both old and new and ranging from watts to megawatts-wave energy systems provide the best solution for remote power generation. As such, research, development and demonstration activities are underway to prove wave energy's ability to provide reliable, consistent energy supplies for certain offshore Oil and Gas activities, paving the way for near term commercialization. This paper outlines these drivers, competitive reaction to them, and why and how wave energy can be a preferable choice for power at sea. Â© 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Low Carbon Desalination by Innovative Membrane Materials and Processes
AB  - Seawater and brackish water desalination has been a practical approach to mitigating the global fresh water scarcity. Current large-scale desalination installations worldwide can complementarily augment the global fresh water supplies, and their capacities are steadily increasing year-on-year. Despite substantial technological advance, desalination processes are deemed energy-intensive and considerable sources of CO2 emission, leading to the urgent need for innovative low carbon desalination platforms. This paper provides a comprehensive review on innovations in membrane processes and membrane materials for low carbon desalination. In this paper, working principles, intrinsic attributes, technical challenges. and recent advances in membrane materials of the membrane-based desalination processes, exclusively including commercialised reverse osmosis (RO) and emerging forward osmosis (FO), membrane distillation (MD), electrodialysis (ED), and capacitive deionisation (CDI), are thoroughly analysed to shed light on the prospect of low carbon desalination.

TI  - Differential responses of net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide to light and temperature between spring and neap tides in subtropical mangrove forests
AB  - The eddy flux data with field records of tidal water inundation depths of the year 2010 from two mangroves forests in southern China were analyzed to investigate the tidal effect on mangrove carbon cycle. We compared the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and its responses to light and temperature, respectively, between spring tide and neap tide inundation periods. For the most time of the year 2010, higher daytime NEE values were found during spring tides than during neap tides at both study sites. Regression analysis of daytime NEE to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) using the Landsberg model showed increased sensitivity of NEE to PAR with higher maximum photosynthetic rate during spring tides than neap tides. In contrast, the light compensation points acquired from the regression function of the Landsberg model were smaller during spring tides than neap tides in most months. The dependence of nighttime NEE on soil temperature was lower under spring tide than under neap tides. All these results above indicated that ecosystem carbon uptake rates of mangrove forests were strengthened, while ecosystem respirations were inhibited during spring tides in comparison with those during neap tides, which needs to be considered in modeling mangrove ecosystem carbon cycle under future sea level rise scenarios.

TI  - Net carbon dioxide emissions from an eroding Atlantic blanket bog
AB  - The net impact of greenhouse gas emissions from degraded peatland environments on national Inventories and subsequent mitigation of such emissions has only been seriously considered within the last decade. Data on greenhouse gas emissions from special cases of peatland degradation, such as eroding peatlands, are particularly scarce. Here, we report the first eddy covariance-based monitoring of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from an eroding Atlantic blanket bog. The CO2 budget across the period July 2018â€“November 2019 was 147 (Â± 9) g C mâˆ’2. For an annual budget that contained proportionally more of the extreme 2018 drought and heat wave, cumulative CO2 emissions were nearly double (191Â g C mâˆ’2) of that of an annual period without drought (106Â g C mâˆ’2), suggesting that direct CO2 emissions from eroded peatlands are at risk of increasing with projected changes in temperatures and precipitation due to global climate change. The results of this study are consistent with chamber-based and modelling studies that suggest degraded blanket bogs to be a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere, and provide baseline data against which to assess future peatland restoration efforts in this region.

TI  - Gasification investigations of coal and biomass blends for high purity H-2 production with carbon capture potential
AB  - Biomass is carbon-neutral and has the carbon-negative potential if combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS). This study investigated the thermochemical conversion to high-purity hydrogen of a typical lignite (BYH) and seaweed biomass (BS) with carbon capture in a designed fixed-bed reactor at moderate conditions (1 atm, 873 K). High-purity hydrogen of 486.91-801.5 ml/g-blends with suppressed CO2 formation was produced in the alkaline gasification. The alkali can decompose the coal/biomass molecular structures, in-situ capture CO2 and control the gases to high-purity H-2 (80.1\%-93.2\%). The synergistic effect of coal and biomass changes the gas evolution behaviors and impacts the chemical structures of the char. The abundant SiO2 and Al2O3 in the coal can inhibit the catalytic activities of earth alkali metals in the biomass, but not much. These results are significant to the future development of low-carbon renewable energy techniques. (C) 2021 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - New insights on subsurface energy resources in the Southern North Sea Basin area
AB  - The Southern North Sea Basin area, stretching from the UK to the Netherlands, has a rich hydrocarbon exploration and production history. The past, present and expected future hydrocarbon and geothermal exploration trends in this area are discussed for eight key lithostratigraphic intervals, ranging from the Lower Carboniferous to Cenozoic. In the period between 2007 and 2017, a total of 95 new hydrocarbon fields were discovered, particularly in Upper Carboniferous, Rotliegend and Triassic reservoirs. Nineteen geothermal systems were discovered in the Netherlands onshore, mainly targeting aquifers in the Rotliegend and Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous formations. Although the Southern North Sea Basin area is mature in terms of hydrocarbon exploration, it is shown that with existing and new geological insights, additional energy resources are still being proven in new plays such as the basal Upper Rotliegend (Ruby discovery) for natural gas and a new Chalk play for oil. It is predicted that hydrocarbon exploration in the Southern North Sea Basin area will probably experience a slight growth in the coming decade before slowing down, as the energy transition further matures. Geothermal exploration is expected to continue growing in the Netherlands onshore as well as gain more momentum in the UK.

TI  - The abstract subject of the climate migrant: displaced by the rising tides of the green energy economy
AB  - A controversial proposal to build themammoth `Site C' damon the Peace River in northwestern Canada offers an opportunity to explore the intersections of climate and migration issues under debate in international environmental governance circles. Site C threatens to flood traditional fishing spots and traplines of Indigenous peoples in the name of the `green energy' economy. We consider how people displaced by renewable energy projects justified as climate mitigation policies might constitute a different kind of `climate refugee' in that they are `displaced without moving' - the connections between the land and the people are severed to the extent that what is lost is the ability of the people to sustain themselves in a place. We demonstrate that the focus on `security' and `risk' in dominant approaches to the phenomenon of climate migration within the international regimes of human rights and climate governance produces contemporary commitments to `migration management' and a prescription for `planned relocations' that employ an abstract conception of the `climate migrant'. The analysis reveals that the dominant international legal order on climate migration is devoid of meaningful consideration of ongoing, embodied practices of living on the land. Its abstract, universalist conceptions of land, labour and livelihoods deny the possibility of people's meaningful relations with specific places and obscure the actual `loss and damage' that transpires when real, material and ecological relations that ground people's connections with land are severed. We conclude that, without concerted resistance and a focus on re-making the underlying structural relations, a policy emphasis on renewable energy development as `climate mitigation' is likely to continue to produce the same inequitable patterns of benefits and burdens as climate change itself.

AB  - A comprehensive description and evaluation is made of the 440 ft water depth Casablanca diverless subsea completion system offshore Spain with respect to design, installation and operation. The development of the system from initial design to field operating experience is described in detail. Installation vessel requirements and modifications are described as well as the actual installation sequence. The selection of the completion system is discussed with respect to well requirements, environmental conditions and operational flexibility. This system is unique in that it was designed for both early production to a floating production facility and for future long term production to a fixed platform. Results show how a successful subsea completion project is conceived and implemented. It is shown how various production considerations (i.e. high temperature oil and high flowrates) are accommodated by design. Operational flexibility is addressed as a major factor in maintaining on-line availability. Â© 1982 Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Ammonia as alkali for ASP floods - Comparison to sodium carbonate
AB  - Ammonia is logistically preferred over sodium carbonate for alkaline-surfactant-polymer enhanced oil recovery projects (ASP) due to its low molar mass and the possibility for it to be delivered as a liquid. On an offshore platform space and weight savings can be the determining factor in deciding whether an ASP project is feasible. Logistics may also be critical in determining the economic feasibility of projects in remote locations. Ammonia functions as an effective alkali together with a surfactant blend of alkyl propoxy sulfate- internal olefin sulfonate (APS/IOS). Surfactant adsorption is low and oil recovery in core floods is high. Static adsorption tests show that low surfactant adsorption is attained at pH > 9, a condition that ammonia satisfies at low solution concentration. It is expected that ammonia has a performance deficiency relative to sodium carbonate in that it does not precipitate calcium from solution. Calcium accumulation in the ammonia ASP solution will occur due to ion exchange from clays. The high oil recovery for ammonia and the calcium accumulation in ASP and SP core floods with APS-IOS blends shows that this surfactant system is effective and calcium-tolerant. Also, phase behavior and IFT measurements suggest that APS/IOS blends remain effective in the presence of calcium. EO/PO sulfates (such as the employed APS) are well known commercially available, calcium-tolerant surfactants. However, due to hydrolysis sulfate-type surfactants such as APS are suitable for use only in lower temperature reservoirs. Very different behavior was noticed for phase behavior measurements with calcium intolerant surfactants such as alkyl benzene sulfonates (ABS) and internal olefin sulfonates (IOS). In this case calcium addition results in a very high IFT and complete separation of oil and brine. Presumably this will result in low oil recovery. A preferred approach for ASP offshore with divalent ion intolerant surfactants may be the use of a hybrid alkali system combining the attributes of sodium carbonate and ammonia. The concept is to supply the bulk of the alkalinity for an ASP flood by ammonia with all the inherent logistical advantages. A minor quantity of sodium carbonate is added to the formulation to specifically precipitate calcium ions. Copyright 2014, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

TI  - Simulation: A new tool in offshore process control
AB  - This paper describes the design, development and subsequent use of a process control simulator for the Murchison field in the British sector of the North Sea. This $1.3 million system duplicates panels found-offshore in the module control rooms for oil production, oil/gas metering and transport, and gas handling. These panels and the mathematical models that mimic the real process were custom designed and built to train operations staff prior to production start-up. Other benefits expected were as a commissioning aid for the real plant and ultimately as an operations research tool. However, during the acceptance trials of the simulator a fourth use was discovered - as a design checkout tool - that may indeed by itself pay out the total investment. Several design anomalies in the real plant have been discovered early enough to permit changes prior to installation offshore. Detailed training using the simulator has been prepared by senior operating staff. This training in a specially constructed classroom onshore, conducted by senior operating personnel will concentrate on the practice of both normal and abnormal operations prior to start-up of the real facilities in late 1980. Great care has been taken to provide realistic exercises in a real control room environment in order to gain total acceptance by the operating personnel being trained.

TI  - Renewable-powered desalination as an optimisation pathway for renewable energy systems: The case of Australia's Murray-Darling Basin
AB  - The ecology in the Murray-Darling Basin in Australia is threatened by water scarcity due to climate change and the over-extraction and over-use of natural water resources. Ensuring environmental flows and sustainable water resources management is urgently needed. Seawater desalination offers high potential to deliver water in virtually unlimited quantity. However, this technology is energy-intensive. In order to prevent desalination becoming a driver of greenhouse gases, the operation of seawater desalination with renewables is increasingly being considered. Our study examines the optimisation of the operation of a 100% renewable energy grid by integrating seawater desalination plants and pipelines as a variable load. We use a GIS-based renewable energy load-shifting model and show how both technologies create synergy effects. First, we analyse what quantity of water is missing in the basin in the long run. We determine locations for seawater desalination plants and pipelines to distribute the water into existing storages in the Murray-Darling Basin. Second, we design a pipeline system and calculate the electricity needed to pump the water from the plants to the storages. Third, we use the combined renewable energy load-shifting model. We minimise the total cost of the energy system by shifting energy demand for water production to periods of high renewable energy availability. Our calculations show that in such a system, the unused spilt electricity can be reduced by at least 27 TWh. The electricity system's installed capacity and levelised cost of electricity can be reduced by up to 29%, and 43% respectively. This approach can provide an annual net economic benefit of $22.5 bn. The results illustrate that the expansion of seawater desalination capacity for load-shifting is economically beneficial. Â© 2019 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.

There is increasing interest in outsourcing to overseas companies, particularly in countries like Ireland, India, and China [9][10][12], Such "offshoring" is typically motivated by: 1. Reduced cost due to lower hourly wages; overseas IT salaries are as low as $15,000 per year. 2. Flexibility to add and reduce staffing as needed. 3. Access to specialized skills and/or processes (e.g. CMM). 4. "Round-the-clock" development; offshore teams can work while their US counterparts are asleep.

TI  - Detection and quantification of CO2 seepage in seawater using the stoichiometric Cseep method: Results from a recent subsea CO2 release experiment in the North Sea
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a potential significant mitigation strategy to combat climate change and ocean acidification. The technology is well understood but its current implementation must be scaled up nearly by a hundredfold to become an effective tool that helps meet mitigation targets. Regulations require monitoring and verification at storage sites, and reliable monitoring strategies for detection and quantification of seepage of the stored carbon need to be developed. The Cseep method was developed for reliable determination of CO2 seepage signal in seawater by estimating and filtering out natural variations in dissolved inorganic carbon (C). In this work, we analysed data from the first-ever subsea CO2 release experiment performed in the north-western North Sea by the EU STEMM-CCS project. We successfully demonstrated the ability of the Cseep method to (i) predict natural C variations around the Goldeneye site over seasonal to interannual time scales; (ii) establish a process-based baseline C concentration with minimal variability; (iii) determine CO2 seepage detection threshold (DT) to reliably differentiate released- CO2 signal from natural variability and quantify released- CO2 dissolved in the sampled seawater. DT values were around 20 \% of the natural C variations indicating high sensitivity of the method. Moreover, with the availability of DT value, the identification of released- CO2 required no preknowledge of seepage occurrence, but we used additional available information to assess the confidence of the results. Overall, the Cseep method features high sensitivity, automation suitability, and represents a powerful future monitoring tool both for large and confined marine areas.

TI  - The Effect of Hydrogen Addition on the Pollutant Emissions of a Marine Internal Combustion Engine Genset
AB  - Hydrogen, as a maritime fuel, is one of the solutions that will assist the shipping sector in addressing the challenges regarding decarbonization, taking into consideration the targets set for 2030 and 2050. The extensive utilization of hydrogen requires massive production of green hydrogen and the development of proper infrastructure to support a sustainable supply chain. An alternative solution is based on the on-board production of hydrogen, where production units are installed on-board the vessel. Along these lines, the HYMAR project aims to test the utilization of a hydrogen production unit for on-board use. The article deals with the use of hydrogen as a fuel for internal combustion engines, taking into consideration reports from literature and the preliminary results of the HYMAR project, focusing on the environmental impact and the reduction in emissions. Experimental investigation on a marine auxiliary engine for power generation, under the HYMAR project, leads to promising results regarding the environmental footprint of the internal combustion engine when hydrogen is added in the fuel mix with increasing percentages.

TI  - Grounding Strategies for High Voltage Shore Connection of Large Passenger Vessels
AB  - High voltage shore connection of large passenger vessels is an important way to improve energy efficiency and reduce local and global emissions, as well as noise. However, it is shown that the vessels' steel hulls will act as sacrificial anodes for the grounding systems in the ports, hence accelerated corrosion of the hulls may occur. The required protective earth (PE) conductor between the hull and the grounding system on shore could also introduce touch voltages above 30 V in case of a fault, posing a safety hazard. Based on field measurements and analyses, a grounding strategy with galvanic separation in the low resistance PE conductor is recommended. It is further advised to use active and passive cathodic protection, and to reduce the set point of the impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) system to approximately 100 mV versus zinc. These measures will reduce the corrosion rate of the vessels' hulls during power delivery from shore, while avoiding transferred touch voltages. Â© 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Impact of functional microbes on nitrogen removal in artificial tidal wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary: Evidence from molecular and stable isotopic analyses
AB  - After decades of rapid development in the delta, the worsening water quality in the Yangtze River estuary has become a concern in China. To improve the situation, we explored the use of two tidal wetland mesocosms (PA and NP), by evaluating nitrogen removal performance, greenhouse gas emissions and underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results show the mesocosms removed similar to 23.9\% of TN from nitrate-dominated river water (1.20 mg L-1), with PA twice effective as NP, which is consistent with the molecular and stable isotopic data. The emissions of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were low in the soil of both PA and NP, while integrated microbial analyses suggest nitrification was the major contributor of nitrite to anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and also the dominant ammonia removal pathway in the mesocosms, particularly PA. The simultaneous dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), anammox, denitrification and nitrification had mainly contributed to the nitrogen removal and greenhouse gas emission reduction, with rates of 0.86-2.05, 11.94-24.38, 44.95-340.95, and 458.56-1046.91 nmol N-2 g(-1) dry soil d(-1), respectively. This study would expand our understanding of the nitrogen-cycling in tidal wetlands, helping develop a sustainable solution to the water pollution problem in the Yangtze River estuary.

AB  - CO2 recovery from flue gas and its underground storage are important to reduce the amount of CO2 in atmosphere and thus to try to reduce or slow down global warming. A discussion covers selection of aquifers for CO2 storage, including work flow, life cycle assessment, and selection conditions; selection of geological storage place around Tomokomai thermal power plant, including CO2 discharge from thermal power plant, existing underground information, selection results based on comparison of Tomokomai open sea candidacy, Makawa open sea candidacy, and Yufutsu candidacy; preliminary calculation of storage capacity; and technological problems, including controlled directed drilling technology, extended reach drilling, and vibration technique along the land and sea boundary.

TI  - Promotion of ecosystem carbon sequestration by invasive predators
AB  - Despite recent interest in understanding the effects of human-induced global change on carbon (C) storage in terrestrial ecosystems, most studies have overlooked the influence of a major element of global change, namely biological invasions. We quantified ecosystem C storage, both above-and below-ground, on each of 18 islands off the coast of New Zealand. Some islands support high densities of nesting seabirds, while others have been invaded by predatory rats and host few seabirds. Our results show that, by preying upon seabirds, rats have indirectly enhanced C sequestration in live plant biomass by 104%, reduced C sequestration in non-living pools by 26% and increased total ecosystem C storage by 37%. Given the current worldwide distribution of rats and other invasive predatory mammals, and the consequent disappearance of seabird colonies, these predators may be important determinants of ecosystem C sequestration.

TI  - Trinidad's first multilateral well successfully integrates horizontal openhole gravel packs
AB  - The first multilateral well in Trinidad was recently drilled and completed in the 759 area of the northern Soldado Field, offshore Trinidad in approximately 60 feet of water. A multilateral completion was selected over conventional well construction to horizontally access heavy-oil reserves in the Forest 4B and 4C sands, located at true vertical depths of 3850- and 4000-ft respectively. Since the formation parameters included poorly sorted, non-uniform formation characteristics, the completion would have to employ some method of sand control. This well represents several "firsts" for this area. It is not only the first multilateral well in Trinidad but is also the first in the area that integrated sand control with a multilateral technique. This paper will discuss the planning, special considerations, and implementation of the techniques chosen to interface sand control into a multilateral well. After reviewing many possibilities, horizontal openhole gravel-pack technology was selected to provide sand-exclusion. A TAML 4 multilateral well junction was selected because it offered a cemented junction with full casing-drift access across the mainbore/lateral interface. In addition to the planning, special considerations, and implementation of horizontal gravel pack into multilateral technology, the paper will discuss lessons learned and future considerations.

TI  - Processes of elite power and low-carbon pathways: Experimentation, financialisation, and dispossession
AB  - What is a low-carbon pathway? To many, it is a way of mitigating climate change. To others, it is about addressing market failure or capturing the co-benefits attached to low-carbon systems, such as jobs or improved health. To still others, it represents building adaptive capacity and resilience in the face of climate change. However, these interpretations can fail to acknowledge how pathways of low-carbon transitions can also become intertwined with processes and structures of inequality, exclusion and injustice. Using a critical lens that draws from a variety of disciplines, this article explores three ways through which responses to climate change can entrench, exacerbate or reconfigure the power of elites. As society attempts to create a low-carbon society, including for example via coastal protection efforts, disaster recovery, or climate change mitigation and renewable energy, these efforts intersect with at least three processes of elite power: experimentation, financialisation, and dispossession. Experimentation is when elites use the world as a laboratory to test or pilot low-carbon technologies or policy models, transferring risks yet not always sharing benefits. Financialisation refers to the expansion and proliferation of finance, capital, and financial markets in the global economy and many national economies, processes of which have recently extended to renewable energy. Dispossession is when elites use decarbonisation as a process through which to appropriate land, wealth, or other assets (and in the process make society more majoritarian and/or unequal). We explore these three themes using a variety of evidence across illustrative case studies, including hard and soft coastal protection measures (Bangladesh, Netherlands), climate risk insurance (Malawi), and renewable energy auctions and associated mechanisms of finance and investment (South Africa and Mexico).

TI  - Ocean warming, more than acidification, reduces shell strength in a commercial shellfish species during food limitation
AB  - Ocean surface pH levels are predicted to fall by 0.3-0.4 pH units by the end of the century and are likely to coincide with an increase in sea surface temperature of 2-4Â°C. The combined effect of ocean acidification and warming on the functional properties of bivalve shells is largely unknown and of growing concern as the shell provides protection from mechanical and environmental challenges. We examined the effects of near-future pH (ambient pH -0.4 pH units) and warming (ambient temperature +4Â°C) on the shells of the commercially important bivalve, Mytilus edulis when fed for a limited period (4-6 h day-1). After six months exposure, warming, but not acidification, significantly reduced shell strength determined as reductions in the maximum load endured by the shells. However, acidification resulted in a reduction in shell flex before failure. Reductions in shell strength with warming could not be explained by alterations in morphology, or shell composition but were accompanied by reductions in shell surface area, and by a fall in whole-body condition index. It appears that warming has an indirect effect on shell strength by re-allocating energy from shell formation to support temperature-related increases in maintenance costs, especially as food supply was limited and the mussels were probably relying on internal energy reserves. The maintenance of shell strength despite seawater acidification suggests that biomineralisation processes are unaffected by the associated changes in CaCO3 saturation levels. We conclude that under near-future climate change conditions, ocean warming will pose a greater risk to shell integrity in M. edulis than ocean acidification when food availability is limited.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and sedimentation in mangrove swamps influenced by hydrogeomorphic conditions and urbanization in Southwest Florida
AB  - This study compares carbon sequestration rates along two independent tidal mangrovecreeks near Naples Bay in Southwest Florida, USA. One tidal creek is hydrologically disturbeddue to upstream land use changes; the other is an undisturbed reference creek. Soil cores werecollected in basin, fringe, and riverine hydrogeomorphic settings along each of the two tidal creeksand analyzed for bulk density, total organic carbon profiles, and sediment accretion. Radionuclides 137Cs and 210Pb were used to estimate recent sediment accretion and carbon sequestration rates.Carbon sequestration rates (mean Â± standard error) for seven sites in the two tidal creeks on theNaples Bay (98 Â± 12 g-C m-2Â· year-1 (n = 18)) are lower than published global means for mangrovewetlands, but consistent with other estimates from the same region. Mean carbon sequestration ratesin the reference riverine setting were highest (162 Â± 5 g-C m-2Â· year-1), followed by rates in thereference fringe and disturbed riverine settings (127 Â± 6 and 125 Â± 5 g-C m-2Â· year-1, respectively).The disturbed fringe sequestered 73 Â± 10 g-C m-2Â· year-1, while rates within the basin settingswere 50 Â± 4 g-C m-2Â· year-1 and 47 Â± 4 g-C m-2Â· year-1 for the reference and disturbed creeks,respectively. These data support our hypothesis that mangroves along a hydrologically disturbedtidal creek sequestered less carbon than did mangroves along an adjacent undisturbed reference creek.

TI  - San Jacinto-Tizate geothermal power plant - Nicaragua: Case study of current and future expansion
AB  - Through the fall 2009 Merger of Ram Power, Polaris Geothermal and Western GeoPower an opportunity arose to optimize the technical and financial performance of the San Jacinto Geothermal Project. This optimization involved the conversion of the project from three Surplus Marine Turbines to two Fuji Steam Turbines. This paper will present a case study of the San Jacinto Phase I and Phase II Expansion Project. Central to this will be the impact to the financial performance, steam consumption and project schedule as a result of the change in the steam turbine technology. This paper will present a case study of the expansion plans for the San Jacinto-Tizate Geothermal Project. Included in this case study will be an evaluation of the comparison of the application of Fuji Steam Turbines to the originally planned installation of surplus Marine Turbines.

TI  - Nutrient Removal and Biomass Production in an Outdoor Pilot-Scale Phototrophic Biofilm Reactor for Effluent Polishing
AB  - An innovative pilot-scale phototrophic biofilm reactor was evaluated over a 5-month period to determine its capacity to remove nitrogen and phosphorus from Dutch municipal wastewater effluents. The areal biomass production rate ranged between 2.7 and 4.5 g dry weight/m(2)/day. The areal nitrogen and phosphorus removal rates averaged 0.13 g N/m(2)/day and 0.023 g P/m(2)/day, which are low compared to removal rates achieved in laboratory biofilm reactors. Nutrient removal increased during the day, decreased with decreasing light intensity and no removal occurred during the night. Additional carbon dioxide supply was not requisite as the wastewater was comprised of enough inorganic carbon to sustain microalgal growth. The study was not conclusive for the limiting factor that caused the low nutrient removal rate, possibly the process was limited by light and temperature, in combination with pH increases above pH 9 during the daytime. This pilot-scale study demonstrated that the proposed phototrophic biofilm reactor is not a viable post-treatment of municipal wastewater effluents under Dutch climate conditions. However, the reactor performance may be improved when controlling the pH and the temperatures in the morning. With these adaptations, a phototrophic biofilm reactor could be feasible at lower latitudes with higher irradiance levels.

TI  - Drilling fluid impact studies show that worker health and the environment can be protected while improving drilling performance
AB  - GTL (Gas-to-Liquid) drilling base fluids, such as Shell GTL Saralineâ„¢ 185V/NEOFLOâ„¢ 4633, are synthetic hydrocarbons produced via Fischer-Tropsch synthesis from natural gas. GTL Fluids are predominantly comprised of iso- and normal paraffins and contain virtually no aromatics or contaminants such as sulphur and amines. Saraline 185V is a Health, Safety, Security, and Environmental (HSSE)-advantaged base fluid for use in global exploration and production drilling operations onshore and offshore. Extensive terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecotoxicity testing with Saraline 185V and related GTL Fluids confirm a lack of acute or significant chronic toxicity to a wide range of environmentally relevant organisms. Saraline 185V is also readily biodegradable in aerobic freshwater, seawater, soil and sediments and will also degrade under anaerobic conditions. The biodegradability can be exploited to bioremediate drill cuttings, as has been demonstrated in both laboratory and field trials. Furthermore, when used offshore, marine benthic surveys have demonstrated that degradation also occurs and that there is a lack of any significant environmental impact associated with the discharge of Saraline 185V contaminated drill cuttings. Extensive mammalian toxicity testing of GTL Products indicates that Saraline 185V will exert very little, if any, toxicity in mammalian species. Saraline 185V is odourless, and vapour emission tests reveal that it has >7-fold lower gas emissions when compared to conventional diesel, thereby leading to better air quality on drilling locations. A recent study which assessed emission and personal exposure levels to various hydrocarbons at key phases of drilling operations confirmed that significantly lower hydrocarbon exposures occurred for mud systems based on Saraline 185V compared to conventional diesel. The drilling performance of GTL versus diesel based muds has also been assessed in an onshore drilling operations study. To enable a fair comparison all wells were drilled in the same formation (located in the Permian Basin of West Texas) using the same drilling rig, crews, bit, footage, fluid contractor, tools and directional driller. These field trial data indicated an overall drilling improvement for GTL over diesel mud. This paper provides an overview of the exposure, human health, environmental and performance studies conducted on GTL drilling fluids. In combination, these create a value proposition for GTL Fluids showing that better health management combined with reduced environmental footprint and improved drilling and equipment performance leads to lower total well costs.

TI  - Amelioration of marine farming impact on the benthic environment using artificial reefs as biofilters
AB  - An in situ monitoring of the sediment characteristics and macrobenthic communities was undertaken at a marine fish culture site in subtropical waters of Hong Kong before and after the deployment of biofilters which were made of cement concrete artificial reef (AR) structures. According to the distance to the boundary of the fish cages, 6 points were selected as sampling stations: 2 at the fish cages, 2 near the boundary of the fish culture area, and 2 reference sites further away from the culture area. Bimonthly sediment samples were collected for analysis of silt-clay fraction (SCF), moisture content (MC), total organic carbon (TOC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP). The macrobenthos (>0.5 mm) present in the sediment were sorted, identified and enumerated. TOC, TKN and TP levels at the fish cage stations were consistently higher than those at the reference stations over the 1-year pre-AR and 2-year post-AR deployment monitoring period. The diversity of macrofauna was significantly reduced at the fish cage stations relative to the reference sites. The intermediary stations near the fish culture area showed a transitional state of disturbance. Over the 2-year post-AR deployment period, TOC, TKN and TP showed a decreasing trend at the fish cage and intermediary stations. More diverse macrofaunal communities were recorded at the fish cage stations, with species diversity H'increasing from 0-1 at the beginning of the AR deployment to H' > 2 at the end of the study. The present results demonstrated that artificial reefs can improve the benthic abiotic environment and biotic conditions beneath fish rafts which are deteriorated due to farming activities.

TI  - Electrochemical CO2 capture and storage with hydrogen generation
AB  - Electrochemical splitting of calcium carbonate (e.g., as contained in inexpensive and abund ant minerals such as limestone) is proposed as a novel method of forming hydroxide solutions that can absorb, neutralize, and store carbon dioxide from the air or from waste streams. CaCO3 is dissolved in the presence of the highly acidic anolyte of a saline water electrolysis cell, forming Ca(OH)2 and H2CO3 (or H2O and CO2). By maintaining a pH between 6 and 9 in the resulting solution, subsequent hydroxide reactions with CO2 primarily produce dissolved calcium bicarbonate, Ca(HCO3)2. Thus, for each mole of CaCO3 split, there can be a net capture of up to 1 mole of CO2. The resulting dissolved Ca(HCO3)2 can be diluted and stored in the ocean, or in reservoirs on land or underground. Net process cost is estimated to be &lt;$100/tonne CO2 mitigated. Other potential co-benefits of the approach include: i) production of significantly carbon-negative H2 if renewable - or nuclear - derived electricity is used as the power source, ii) the option of locally producing electricity and freshwater via fuel cell oxidation of the H2, iii) direct neutralization of ongoing ocean acidification if the Ca(OH)2 generated is added to seawater, iv) preservation or enhancement of otherwise threatened marine shellfish and coral populations, via CO2 absorption and Ca(HCO3)2 formation in or addition to the marine environment, and v) safe ut ilization of the ocean's vast carbon storage and energy production potentials for CO2 mitigation and "super green" hydrogen generation.

TI  - Bioenergy to save the world - Producing novel energy plants for growth on abandoned land
AB  - Background and Aim. Following to the 2006 climate summit, the European Union formally set the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. But even today, climate change is already affecting people and ecosystems. Examples are melting glaciers and polar ice, reports about thawing permafrost areas, dying coral reefs, rising sea levels, changing ecosystems and fatal heat periods. Within the last 150 years, CO2 levels rose from 280 ppm to currently over 400 ppm. If we continue on our present course, CO2 equivalent levels could approach 600 ppm by 2035. However, if CO2 levels are not stabilized at the 450-550 ppm level, the consequences could be quite severe. Hence, if we do not act now, the opportunity to stabilise at even 550 ppm is likely to slip away. Long-term stabilisation will require that CO2 emissions ultimately be reduced to more than 80\% below current levels. This will require major changes in how we operate. Results. Reducing greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels seems to be the most promising approach to counterbalance the dramatic climate changes we would face in the near future. It is clear since the Kyoto protocol that the availability of fossil carbon resources will not match our future requirements. Furthermore, the distribution of fossil carbon sources around the globe makes them an even less reliable source in the future. We propose to screen crop and non-crop species for high biomass production and good survival on marginal soils as well as to produce mutants from the same species by chemical mutagenesis or related methods. These plants, when grown in adequate crop rotation, will provide local farming communities with biomass for the fermentation in decentralized biogas reactors, and the resulting nitrogen rich manure can be distributed on the fields to improve the soil. Discussion. Such an approach will open new economic perspectives to small farmers, and provide a clever way to self sufficient and sustainable rural development. Together with the present economic reality, where energy and raw material prices have drastically increased over the last decade, they necessitate the development and the establishment of alternative concepts. Conclusions. Biotechnology is available to apply fast breeding to promising energy plant species. It is important that our valuable arable land is preserved for agriculture. The opportunity to switch from low-income agriculture to biogas production may convince small farmers to adhere to their business and by that preserve the identity of rural communities. Perspectives. Overall, biogas is a promising alternative for the future, because its resource base is widely available, and single farms or small local cooperatives might start biogas plant operation.

TI  - The sequestration of PCBs in Lake Hartwell sediment with activated carbon
AB  - Recent laboratory studies with a marine sediment from a tidal mudflat in San Francisco Bay demonstrated that a low dose of activated carbon enhances the sequestration of PCBs and PAHs under well-mixed conditions. Here we compare activated carbon treatment for a freshwater sediment from a rural site, using PCB-contaminated sediment from Lake Hartwell, SC. An activated carbon dose of 2\% of the dry sediment mass lowered total aqueous PCB concentrations by more than 95\% after 1 month of treatment and more than 98\% after 6 months. Aqueous PCB concentrations remained below detection limits following 18 months of sediment-carbon contact in slowly mixed systems. Uptake of PCBs into semipermeable membrane devices was reduced by 78\%, 91\% and 97\% over 1, 6 and 18 months, respectively. These tests show that PCB sequestration with activated carbon improves with contact time and is not diminished by prolonged mixing with sediment. Desorption studies confirmed the sequestration, in which 74\% of the total PCB mass could be desorbed from untreated Lake Hartwell sediment within 30 days as compared to only 7\% after activated carbon treatment for 6 months. We compare these observations with marine sediment from San Francisco Bay and propose a conceptual model to rationalize how sediment properties relate to the reduction in aqueous PCB concentrations during activated carbon treatment.

TI  - Coastal flooding and new nuclear build: Risk, uncertainty and precaution in the strategic siting assessment process
AB  - In light with the UK Government's plan to build new nuclear reactors and related infrastructure, the UK's largest nuclear plant operator, British Energy (BE) released plans to place new nuclear reactors on coastal sites adjacent to existing plants. The plan is still under evaluation by the UK Government's Strategic Siting Assessment (SSA) process. An inquiry is thus proposed to look at whether SSA will be taking a sufficiently precautionary approach in the light of climate change-related flood risk projected for the lifespan of the projects. In addition, the inquiry, supported by Greenpeace, aims to look at flood planning guidance, and call for heightened precaution over uncertainties associated with climate change. The inquiry will take into account relevant flood guidance documents for England and question the extent to which the English planning system is prepared for making decisions on coastal sited nuclear power plant applications.

TI  - Prevention of Potential Hazards Associated with Marine Gas Hydrate Exploitation: A Review
AB  - Marine gas hydrates (MGHs), which have great potential for exploitation and utilization, account for around 99\% of all global natural gas hydrate resources under current prospecting technique. However, there are several potential hazards associated with their production and development. These are classified into four categories by this paper: marine geohazards, greenhouse gas emissions, marine ecological hazards, and marine engineering hazards. In order to prevent these risks from occurring, the concept of lifecycle management of hazards prevention during the development and production from MGHs is proposed and divided into three stages: preparation, production control, and post-production protection. Of these stages, economic evaluation of the resource is the foundation; gas production methods are the key; with monitoring, assessment, and early warning as the guarantee. A production test in the Shenhu area of the South China Sea shows that MGH exploration and development can be planned using the three-steps methodology: commercializing and developing research ideas in the short term, maintaining economic levels of production in the medium term, and forming a global forum to discuss effective MGH development in the long term. When increasing MGH development is combined with the lifecycle management of hazards prevention system, and technological innovations are combined with global cooperation to solve the risks associated with MGH development, then safe access to a new source of clean energy may be obtained.

TI  - Multi-terminal HVDC Grid Topology for large Scale Integration of Offshore Wind on the U.S Atlantic Coast
AB  - Amid rising concerns regarding dearth of fossil fuels and global climate change, different nations across the globe have set forth vigorous targets for renewable integration and corresponding power network development/upgradation. One of the most significant renewable resources is offshore wind (OSW) power that bears the capability to resolve the above discuss challenges, if developed properly. This paper is dedicated towards planned offshore grid development in the U.S. Atlantic Coast to integrate existing/future OSW wind power projects to the onshore grid. It proposes a modular multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) network for large scale integration of OSW power. It addresses the associated challenges and provides a way forward for the realization of the planned offshore grid. This paper could provide an initial guideline for electric utilities, regulators, and government departments to accrue maximum benefit from the enormous OSW resource in the U.S. Â© 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Sea Level-Driven Marsh Migration Results in Rapid Net Loss of Carbon
AB  - Sea level rise alters coastal carbon cycling by driving the rapid migration of coastal ecosystems, salinization of freshwater systems, and replacement of terrestrial forests with tidal wetlands. Wetland soils accumulate carbon (C) at faster rates than terrestrial soils, implying that sea level rise may lead to enhanced carbon accumulation. Here, we show that carbon stored in tree biomass greatly exceeds carbon stored in adjacent marsh soils so that marsh migration reduces total carbon stocks by similar to 50\% in less than 100 years. Continued marsh soil carbon accumulation may eventually offset forest carbon loss, but we estimate that the time for replacement is similar to estimates of marsh survival (i.e., centuries), which suggests that forest C may never be replaced. These findings reveal a critical C source not included in coastal C budgets driven by migrating ecosystems and rapidly shifting allocations between carbon stored in soils and biomass.

TI  - Uncertain response of ocean biological carbon export in a changing world
AB  - The transfer of organic carbon from the upper to the deep ocean by particulate export flux is the starting point for the long-term storage of photosynthetically fixed carbon. This `biological carbon pump' is a critical component of the global carbon cycle, reducing atmospheric CO2 levels by similar to 200 ppm relative to a world without export flux. This carbon flux also fuels the productivity of the mesopelagic zone, including important fisheries. Here we show that, despite its importance for understanding future ocean carbon cycling, Earth system models disagree on the projected response of the global export flux to climate change, with estimates ranging from -41\% to +1.8\%. Fundamental constraints to understanding export flux arise because a myriad of interconnected processes make the biological carbon pump challenging to both observe and model. Our synthesis prioritizes the processes likely to be most important to include in modern-day estimates (particle fragmentation and zooplankton vertical migration) and future projections (phytoplankton and particle size spectra and temperature-dependent remineralization) of export. We also identify the observations required to achieve more robust characterization, and hence improved model parameterization, of export flux and thus reduce uncertainties in current and future estimates in the overall cycling of carbon in the ocean.

TI  - Big data in the digital oilfield requires data transfer standards to perform
AB  - The digital oilfield is evolving with the number of sensors and measuring devices and the frequency of data sampling both increasing dramatically, which is the onset of what is commonly referred to as Big Data. These increases are needed as the motivation for the collection and transmittal of data has moved from the remote observation of operations to the remote operation of increasingly automated systems, as well as the goal of reliable prediction tools that improve efficiency. A lot is written and discussed about how to handle Big Data in the context of data management and analytics. However, the task of transferring the digital information from the field to the back office is critical. This is built on advances in standards for data formats, metadata and transmission protocols that have been published to support the digital oilfield of the future. The first advance has been the larger amount of metadata, providing detailed information on the data source's characteristics, eventual transformations to the data (by who, using what tools, etc.) and prior vetting. The second one is to replace transmission protocols based on polling different servers with streaming processes that do away with inefficient interrogation, handshake and packaging overheads. The implementation of these improved standards allows operators to build solutions that involve different vendors. A test was put in place involving an active North Sea drilling operation, with data being transferred to onshore observers both at the operator's facilities and on the premises of a service provider. Data was streaming on to the screens of both observing parties less than one second after the event took place on the rig. This compares to lag times of 15 to 20 seconds using polling methods. The bandwidth usage was approximately 1/10 compared to previous methods, such that more sensors could be added to the data transmittal. With more immediate access to a much broader and richer set of data both at the operator's facilities and also at the premises of many contractors, service providers in particular could make more educated assessments of developing situations on the rig, which in several cases avoided the need for a team to go to the offshore rig, thus reducing the number helicopter flights to the offshore installations and accounting for fewer people-on-board (POB), which contributed to lower HSE exposure and lower costs.

TI  - Effects of Ocean Acidification on the Ballast of Surface Aggregates Sinking through the Twilight Zone
AB  - The dissolution of CaCO3 is one of the ways ocean acidification can, potentially, greatly affect the ballast of aggregates. A diminution of the ballast could reduce the settling speed of aggregates, resulting in a change in the carbon flux to the deep sea. This would mean lower amounts of more refractory organic matter reaching the ocean floor. This work aimed to determine the effect of ocean acidification on the ballast of sinking surface aggregates. Our hypothesis was that the decrease of pH will increase the dissolution of particulate inorganic carbon ballasting the aggregates, consequently reducing their settling velocity and increasing their residence time in the upper twilight zone. Using a new methodology for simulation of aggregate settling, our results suggest that future pCO2 conditions can significantly change the ballast composition of sinking aggregates. The change in aggregate composition had an effect on the size distribution of the aggregates, with a shift to smaller aggregates. A change also occurred in the settling velocity of the particles, which would lead to a higher residence time in the water column, where they could be continuously degraded. In the environment, such an effect would result in a reduction of the carbon flux to the deep-sea. This reduction would impact those benthic communities, which rely on the vertical flow of carbon as primary source of energy. Â© 2012 de Jesus Mendes, Thomsen.

TI  - The commercial case for hydrogen as a route to market for offshore wind in the North Sea
AB  - The UK was the first major industrialised nation to commit to a Net Zero target by 2050, and Scotland has an even more ambitious target to reach Net Zero by 2045. To realise these targets, hydrogen will play a leading role in the decarbonisation of multiple sectors including industry, transport, heat and power. Offshore wind can be a core component of our future energy infrastructure, and the scale of its potential role in hydrogen production has recently drawn wider attention from policy makers, developers and potential users across a range of sectors. Hydrogen as a route to market for offshore wind therefore presents a transformative opportunity for the North Sea oil and gas sector and the associated UK supply chain. Existing skills and infrastructure in this region can be leveraged to achieve a leading position in this emerging clean fuel source. This opportunity is particularly relevant for sites in the North Sea which are further from shore with good wind resource, where power transmission costs and/or losses would be prohibitive. Additionally, hydrogen offers an interesting route to market for projects unable to obtain firm grid connection, for sites in regions with high grid charges, or where sufficient government revenue support for conventional power generation is not available for all good quality sites.

TI  - Seagrass meadows as a globally significant carbonate reservoir
AB  - There has been growing interest in quantifying the capacity of seagrass ecosystems to act as carbon sinks as a natural way of offsetting anthropogenic carbon emissions to the atmosphere. However, most of the efforts have focused on the particulate organic carbon (POC) stocks and accumulation rates and ignored the particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) fraction, despite important carbonate pools associated with calcifying organisms inhabiting the meadows, such as epiphytes and benthic invertebrates, and despite the relevance that carbonate precipitation and dissolution processes have in the global carbon cycle. This study offers the first assessment of the global PIC stocks in seagrass sediments using a synthesis of published and unpublished data on sediment carbonate concentration from 403 vegetated and 34 adjacent un-vegetated sites. PIC stocks in the top 1 m of sediment ranged between 3 and 1660 Mg PIC ha(-1), with an average of 654 +/- 24 Mg PIC ha(-1), exceeding those of POC reported in previous studies by about a factor of 5. Sedimentary carbonate stocks varied across seagrass communities, with meadows dominated by Halodule, Thalassia or Cymodocea supporting the highest PIC stocks, and tended to decrease polewards at a rate of -8 +/- 2 Mg PIC ha(-1) per degree of latitude (general linear model, GLM; p < 0.0003). Using PIC concentrations and estimates of sediment accretion in seagrass meadows, the mean PIC accumulation rate in seagrass sediments is found to be 126.3 +/- 31.05 g PIC m(-2) yr(-1). Based on the global extent of seagrass meadows (177 000 to 600 000 km(2)), these ecosystems globally store between 11 and 39 Pg of PIC in the top metre of sediment and accumulate between 22 and 75 Tg PIC yr(-1), representing a significant contribution to the carbonate dynamics of coastal areas. Despite the fact that these high rates of carbonate accumulation imply CO2 emissions from precipitation, seagrass meadows are still strong CO2 sinks as demonstrated by the comparison of carbon (PIC and POC) stocks between vegetated and adjacent un-vegetated sediments.

TI  - Successful implementation of through tubing technology (sand control and gas lift) in challenging offshore environment as an integrated development strategy for sustainable development of marginal fields: A case study
AB  - Well AB-5 was drilled & completed in a marginal field in offshore West coast of India. Initially well produced only gas, till the oil bearing sands were perforated & it was being put on commingled oil & gas production. Through tubing sand control was installed in the well in view of continuous sand fill observed post perforation due to unconsolidated sand formation. Over the period of time, formation pressure depleted and the well eventually load up & died in absence of any mode of artificial lift on the unmanned platform. The Challenge was to unload & activate the well using gas lift in a commercially viable manner, avoiding expensive Barge based operation without having the said facility & provisions available. Since no Gas Lift Mandrel was present in the upper completion, a Thru-tubing Gas lift technique using retrievable straddle packers with GLV in between & conveyed on slick line was being adopted. A temporary arrangement of nitrogen tanks, pumps & surface set up for subsequent well unloading was organized. Further, a 20 T modular crane was installed on the platform after a detailed platform structural load analysis for spotting the surface equipment. Detailed NODAL analysis was being carried out for modeling the required nitrogen rates and the well performance at different gas lift parameters. Post GLV installation, nitrogen was pumped thru the annulus via the GLV, installed against circulating SSD, into the tubing. This Paper not only describes the Job design, technique implemented & challenges overcome during successfully activating a theoretically dead well to approx. 1000 BOPD production, thus establishing the viability of Through Tubing Sand Control (TTSC) & Thru-Tubing Gas Lift (TTGL) technologies but also delivers an integrated development strategy for sustainable development of marginal fields. The same technology is now being implemented in other water loaded wells of the field having similar technical and logistical constraints.

TI  - Two decades of ocean CO2 sink and variability
AB  - Atmospheric CO2 has increased at a nearly identical average rate of 3.3 and 3.2 Pg C yr(-1) for the decades of the 1980s and the 1990s, in spite of a large increase in fossil fuel emissions from 5.4 to 6.3 Pg C yr(-1). Thus, the sum of the ocean and land CO2 sinks was 1 Pg C yr(-1) larger in the 1990s than in to the 1980s. Here we quantify the ocean and land sinks for these two decades using recent atmospheric inversions and ocean models. The ocean and land sinks are estimated to be, respectively, 0.3 (0.1 to 0.6) and 0.7 (0.4 to 0.9) Pg C yr(-1) larger in the 1990s than in the 1980s. When variability less than 5 yr is removed, all estimates show a global oceanic sink more or less steadily increasing with time, and a large anomaly in the land sink during 1990-1994. For year-to-year variability, all estimates show 1/3 to 1/2 less variability in the ocean than on land, but the amplitude and phase of the oceanic variability remain poorly determined. A mean oceanic sink of 1.9 Pg C yr(-1) for the 1990s based on O-2 observations corrected for ocean outgassing is supported by these estimates, but an uncertainty on the mean value of the order of +/-0.7 Pg C yr(-1) remains. The difference between the two decades appears to be more robust than the absolute value of either of the two decades.

TI  - Configuration Discussions of the Chemically Recuperated Gas Turbine Powering a Ship
AB  - The chemically recuperated gas turbine (CRGT) is a promising engine on ship because of its high thermal efficiency and low pollutant emission. This paper is aimed at determining an applicable configuration of the CRGT for marine applications. Diesel is the selected fuel, and the minimization of Gibbs free energy method (MGFE) is applied to model the diesel-steam reforming reaction. A chemical regenerator (CR) is designed based on the reforming reaction, and a steam generator (SG) is set on the foundation of thermodynamics. Some feasible configurations of the CRGT are proposed based on a marine gas turbine with two spool shaft and a free power turbine and the best one is determined by performance calculation. The best configuration has a 44.51\% thermal efficiency at rated 25MW output power of the prototype, and good stability in operation. Additionally, the selected configuration has lower combustion temperature at the same output power with the other configurations, and it can yield less NOX emissions. These works form the foundation of the CRGT being applied in the marine propulsion and provide a research thought for the CRGT in other applications.

TI  - Fish energy budget under ocean warming and flame retardant exposure
AB  - Climate change and chemical contamination are global environmental threats of growing concern for the scientific community and regulatory authorities. Yet, the impacts and interactions of both stressors (particularly ocean warming and emerging chemical contaminants) on physiological responses of marine organisms remain unclear and still require further understanding. Within this context, the main goal of this study was to assess, for the first time, the effects of warming (+ 5 Â°C) and accumulation of a polybrominated diphenyl ether congener (BDE-209, brominated flame retardant) through dietary exposure on energy budget of the juvenile white seabream (Diplodus sargus). Specifically, growth (G), routine metabolism (R), excretion (faecal, F and nitrogenous losses, U) and food consumption (C) were calculated to obtain the energy budget. The results demonstrated that the energy proportion spent for G dominated the mode of the energy allocation of juvenile white seabream (56.0â€“67.8%), especially under the combined effect of warming plus BDE-209 exposure. Under all treatments, the energy channelled for R varied around 26% and a much smaller percentage was channelled for excretion (F: 4.3â€“16.0% and U: 2.3â€“3.3%). An opposite trend to G was observed to F, where the highest percentage (16.0 Â± 0.9%) was found under control temperature and BDE-209 exposure via diet. In general, the parameters were significantly affected by increased temperature and flame retardant exposure, where higher levels occurred for: i) wet weight, relative growth rate, protein and ash contents under warming conditions, ii) only for O:N ratio under BDE-209 exposure via diet, and iii) for feed efficiency, ammonia excretion rate, routine metabolic rate and assimilation efficiency under the combination of both stressors. On the other hand, decreased viscerosomatic index was observed under warming and lower fat content was observed under the combined effect of both stressors. Overall, under future warming and chemical contamination conditions, fish energy budget was greatly affected, which may dictate negative cascading impacts at population and community levels. Further research combining other climate change stressors (e.g. acidification and hypoxia) and emerging chemical contaminants are needed to better understand and forecast such biological effects in a changing ocean.

TI  - Hierarchically Coordinated Voltage Control in Seaport Microgrids Considering Optimal Voyage Navigation of All-Electric Ships
AB  - The uncoordinated scheduling and control of all-electric ships (AESs) will impose great challenges on voltage profiles in seaport microgrids. This article proposes a three-stage hierarchically coordinated voltage control strategy in seaport microgrids considering the optimal voyage navigation and scheduling of AES. In stage one, we first propose an arrival time estimation method for AES to reduce the potential voltage violation risk in different seaport microgrids. The optimal power flow (OPF) is then performed in each microgrid to determine the day-ahead dispatch of on-load tap changer (OLTC) and inverter-based renewable energy resources (RESs). In stage two, the optimal route planning is carried out based on the sea states and the Dijkstra algorithm. The voyage and generation scheduling of AES are formulated as optimization problems and solved by CPLEX solvers. In stage three, a real-time local voltage control strategy is performed to mitigate fast voltage violations. To fully exploit the voltage support capability of energy storage systems (ESSs) on berthed-in AES, both constant charging mode and voltage control mode are designed to regulate voltages while ensuring sufficient SOC levels of ESS when leaving the seaport. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method both in saving the generation cost of AES and improving voltage profiles in seaport microgrids.

TI  - Space sunshades and climate change
AB  - The accelerated rate of increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations in recent years and the inability of humankind to move away from carbon-based energy system have led to the revival of the idea of counteracting global warming through geoengineering schemes. Two categories of geoengineering proposals have been suggested: solar radiation management (SRM) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods. SRM schemes would attempt to reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by our planet. Placing reflectors or mirrors in space, injecting aerosols into the stratosphere, and enhancing the albedo of marine clouds are some of the proposed SRM methods. In this section, the various space-based SRM methods which are likely to reduce the incoming solar radiation uniformly across the globe are discussed. In the past decade, the effects of these space sunshades on the climate system have been simulated using climate models by reducing the amount of incoming solar radiation by appropriate amounts (reduced solar constant). Key modeling results on the extent of global and regional climate change mitigation, unintended side effects, and unmitigated effects are briefly discussed.

TI  - â€œSustainable energy for allâ€ approach to SIDS: A case study from Dominica
AB  - The Commonwealth of Dominica, amongst the least populated islands in the Caribbean (70,000 pop.), identified the potential to upgrade and expand its hydropower generating capacity from various sites in the country. One site is located in Newtown, outside of Roseau (Dominicaâ€™s capital city). It offers the possibility of increasing its share of clean energy in the countryâ€™s electricity mix through small-scale hydro developments. Dominica has also considered the development of additional hydropower resources within the Roseau valley, a protected area, though it requires addressing ecosystem-based climate resilience concerns in an integrated manner. This may pose a sustainable energy challenge in the short term; in the long run, Dominica plans to become carbon negative through the addition of geothermal energy to its electricity mix. The Governmentâ€™s commitment to these plans has been internationally declared, as part of the United Nations Secretary-General â€œSustainable Energy for Allâ€ (SE4All) initiative. SE4All provides the country with a chance to contribute to its global objectives, by addressing national electricity demand where 70Â % of the countryâ€™s energy matrix comes from fossil fuels (the remainder coming from hydropower). In response to the request for assistance to reduce its reliance on costly fuel imports, UNDP support to Dominicaâ€™s efforts is following an approach targeting the adoption of green, low-emission and climate-resilient development strategies (GLECRDS). Through the GLECRDS approach, UNDP is helping other developing countries â€“several of them, small island developing states (SIDS)â€”to combine and sequence different sources of finance to address broader sustainable development concerns.

TI  - Ice Algae-Produced Carbon Is Critical for Overwintering of Antarctic Krill Euphausia superba
AB  - Antarctic krill Euphausia superba ({''}krill{''}) constitute a fundamental food source for Antarctic seabirds and mammals, and a globally important fisheries resource. The future resilience of krill to climate change depends critically on the winter survival of young krill. To survive periods of extremely low production by pelagic algae during winter, krill are assumed to rely partly on carbon produced by ice algae. The true dependency on ice algae-produced carbon, however, is so far unquantified. This confounds predictions on the future resilience of krill stocks to sea ice decline. Fatty acid (FA) analysis, bulk stable isotope analysis (BSIA), and compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of diatom- and dinoflagellate-associated marker FAs were applied to quantify the dependency of overwintering larval, juvenile, and adult krill on ice algae-produced carbon (alpha(ice)) during winter 2013 in the Weddell-Scotia Confluence Zone. Our results demonstrate that the majority of the carbon uptake of the overwintering larval and juvenile krill originated from ice algae (up to 88\% of the carbon budget), and that the dependency on ice algal carbon decreased with ontogeny, reaching 56\% of the carbon budget in adults. Spatio-temporal variability in the utilization of ice algal carbon was more pronounced in larvae and juvenile krill than in adults. Differences between uice estimates derived from short- vs. long-term FA-specific isotopic compositions suggested that ice algae-produced carbon gained importance as the winter progressed, and might become critical at the late winter-spring transition, before the phytoplankton bloom commences. Where the sea ice season shortens, reduced availability of ice algae might possibly not be compensated by surplus phytoplankton production during wintertime. Hence, sea ice decline could seriously endanger the winter survival of recruits, and subsequently overall biomass of krill.

TI  - Experimental and Computational study of Thermodynamic hydrate inhibitor mixing and displacement in subsea jumper
AB  - The risk of gas hydrate formation is one of the major concerns for offshore flow assurance. Solutions of methanol (MeOH) and mono-ethylene-glycol (MEG) are most often employed as thermodynamic inhibitors (THI) to prevent the formation of hydrate plugs. This study involves experimental and modeling work to investigate and compare the suitability and effectiveness of methanol and MEG on inhibiting and displacing the water in jumper type configurations during flushing procedures. Numerical analysis aims to investigate the mixing and displacing mechanisms that occur during jumper flushing to optimize key factors such as the position of the injection port and the flowrate of a required chemical inhibitor. This paper presents the experimental results with respect to effect of inhibitor type, injection rate, brine salinity and liquid loading. All experiments were carried out in a 3" jumper system at The University of Tulsa. Simulations using ID transient multiphase flow simulator were conducted to evaluate its capacity to predict the thermodynamic inhibitor dispersion by using the inhibitor tracking module. The 3D computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed with the commercial software to help predict the amount and flowrates of chemicals required, and to serve optimizing the location of injection ports. Comparisons were made between the simulation results and experimental data from full fresh water loading jumper displacement tests with MEG and methanol. From the experiments, several conclusions are drawn. Different dispersion and partitioning mechanisms were observed for methanol and MEG through experiments, especially in the vertical sections and low spots of the jumper. Methanol overriding the water phase at horizontal low spots was captured for the low velocity experimental cases, leaving a large amount of water behind that could result in under-inhibited situations. For the 12% brine tests, less water was displaced for each MEG injection rate, whereas a better mixing of methanol with brine was measured. The 1D and 3D simulations provided reasonable prediction for THI distribution along the jumper after displacement tests, except that neither was able to reproduce methanol overriding the water phase at both low spots. 3D CFD simulations results obtained generally gave better agreement with the results from the experiment. This study provides a better understanding of the displacement and mixing mechanisms of thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors. It helps operators minimize operational risks, reducing the size of the umbilical and decreasing capital costs related to equipment and chemicals. Â© 2018, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Regional resource distribution of onshore carbon geological utilization in China
AB  - CO2 geological utilization (CGU) technologies have a great potential to enable large-scale CO2 storage at reasonable cost and is widely considered to be a strategic technology option to help reduce CO2 emissions. CGU technology can be applied to enhance the recovery of oil (CO2-EOR), natural gas (CO2-EGR), underground water (CO2-EWR), coal-bed methane (CO2-ECBM), shale gas (CO2-ESGR), geothermal energy (CO2-EGS), in situ uranium leaching (CO2-IUL), and others. The first step in evaluating of CGU technologies is to determine the storage resource, technical readiness, and geographical distribution of CO2 storage resources. This paper presents preliminary evaluation results on storage resource, technology readiness level and geographic distribution of onshore CGU in China; the results were obtained by performing a resource evaluation methodology, technology readiness level (TRL) method, and geographic information system tool. Results indicate a significant resource for onshore CGU technologies and good proximity in some parts of China. However, CO2 storage resources with high TRLs and low cost are located in the northeast, northwest, and southeast regions and not in the south and coastal areas of China, where most CO2 emission sources locate. Therefore, the timeframes and options for CGU deployment in different regions vary. This situation indicates that different regions have to perform CO2 mitigation by employing different CGU technologies at different timeframes. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Lateral response of trenched pipelines to large deformations in clay
AB  - Subsea pipelines are usually buried in shallow waters for physical protection. Buried pipelines may experience large lateral displacement in different occasions such as ice gouging, ground movement, significant thermal gradients, and dragging by anchors, fish traps, etc. Backfilling materials are often heavily remoulded under functional and environmental loads and are considerably softer than trenched native ground. This, in turn, affects the failure mechanisms in the surrounding soil and the lateral loaddisplacement response of the pipeline, consequently. These important considerations are covered less often in the design codes and standards. In this study, the lateral pipeline-backfill-trench interaction was studied through centrifuge testing of sixteen distinct pipe-soil configurations under drained and partially drained conditions. A transparent observation window combined with digital cameras were used for Particle Image Velocimetry (PI V) analysis. A range of instruments was installed on the pipeline, backfill, and the trench to obtain the key data and the lateral p-y response of the buried pipe. The influence of several key parameters on the lateral pipeline response was also investigated including backfilling properties, trench geometry, interaction rate effect, and burial depth. The results showed that the failure mechanisms, affected by various pipeline-backfill-trench interaction parameters, have a significant impact on the lateral p-y response and the ultimate soil resistance. The study program provided an in-depth insight into this challenging area and prepared the ground for proposing new models and methodologies for incorporating more realistic conditions for pipeline design subjected to large lateral displacements.

TI  - Hydrolysis hydrogen generation medium regulated by alkali metal cations for Mg-based alloy-Green seawater modification strategy
AB  - To optimize the hydrolysis hydrogen generation process of Mg-based alloy and solve the problem of energies shortage without environmental risk, a green and reasonable regulation strategy of hydrolysis medium is proposed to ensure the conversion from grey hydrogen to green hydrogen. In this work, green modification hydrolysis medium strategy employed neutral alkali metal cations instead of acidized/alkalized ions is proposed to utilize for hydrolysis of (Mg10Ni)10Ce alloy. The green regulation of seawater by introducing the low cost neutral alkali metal cations is tried. The results are as follows: The as-cast (Mg10Ni)10Ce alloy hydrolysis induction period is the shortest and the H2 yield is the highest with 173.38 mL g-1 in KCl solution within 20 min at 25 degrees C. The hydrolysis hydrogen generation yield of modified seawater by the neutral alkali metal cations are first higher and then lower than that in the seawater. The hydrolysis process of (Mg10Ni)10Ce in alkali metal cations medium confirms that the type and content of ions has significant effects on the diffusion and transmission process of the medium. It is expected to lay a solid foundation for the development of green portable hydrogen generators and the widespread of clean hydrogen energy and emission reduction.

TI  - Carbon remineralization in the Amazon-Guianas tropical mobile mudbelt: A sedimentary incinerator
AB  - The Amazon River spawns a vast mobile mudbelt extending similar to 1600 km from the equator to the Orinoco delta. Deposits along the Amazon-Guianas coastline are characterized by some of the highest C-org remineralization rates reported for estuarine, deltaic, or shelf deposits, however, paradoxically, except where stabilized by mangroves or intertidal algal mats, they are usually suboxic and nonsulfidic. A combination of tides, wind-driven waves, and coastal currents forms massive fluid muds and mobile surface sediment layers similar to 0.5-2m, thick which are dynamically refluxed and frequently reoxidized. Overall, the seabed functions as a periodically mixed batch reactor, efficiently remineralizing organic matter in a gigantic sedimentary incinerator of global importance. Amazon River material entering the head of this dynamic dispersal system carries an initial terrestrial sedimentary Corg loading of similar to 0.7 mg Cm-2 particle surface area. Total C-org loading is lowered to similar to 0.2 mg Cm-2 in the proximal delta topset, similar to 60-70\% of which remains of terrestrial origin. Loading decreases further to 0.12-0.14 mg Cm-2 (similar to 60\% terrestrial) in mudbanks similar to 600 km downdrift along French Guiana, values comparable to those found in the oligotrophic deepsea. DOC/Sigma CO2 ratios in pore waters of French Guiana mudbanks indicate that > 90\% of metabolized organic substrates are completely oxidized. Within the Amazon delta topset at the head of the dispersal system, both terrestrial and marine organic matter contribute substantially to early diagenetic remineralization, although reactive marine substrate dominates (similar to 60-70\%). The conditional rate constant for terrestrial C-org in the delta topset is similar to 0.2 a(-1). As sedimentary C-org is depleted during transit, marine sources become virtually the exclusive substrate for remineralization except very near the mangrove shoreline. The delta C-13 and Delta C-14 values of pore water Sigma CO2 in mudbanks demonstrate that the primary source of remineralized organic matter within similar to 1 km of shore is a small quantity of bomb signature marine plankton (+ 80 parts per thousand). Thus, fresh marine organic material is constantly entrained into mobile deposits and increasingly drives early diagenetic reactions along the transit path. Relatively refractory terrestrial C-org is lost more slowly but steadily during sedimentary refluxing and suboxic diagenesis. Amazon Fan deposits formed during low sea level stand largely bypassed this suboxic sedimentary incinerator and stored material with up to similar to 3X the modern high stand inner shelf C-org load (Keil et al., 1997b. Proceedings of the Ocean Drilling Program, Scientific Results. Vol. 155. pp. 531-537). Sedimentary dynamics, including frequency and magnitude of remobilization, and the nature of dispersal systems are clearly key controls on diagenetic processes, biogeochemical cycling, and global C storage along the continental margins.

TI  - Environmental resilience and sustainability through green technologies: A case evidence from rural coastal India
AB  - Rural coastal regions in developing countries are generally neglected with respect to environmental issues. The present study examined the feasibility of green technologies such as rainwater harvesting (RWH), sand filtration (SF), and composting (in-vessel and pit) to recover from the environmental issues in the coastal rural regions using survey and geographic information systems considering a rural Indian case study. According to the results, RWH yielded 0.140 million litres per 100 m2 rooftop in the area, while a maximum total dissolved solids removal of 52\% was achieved using the SF alleviating the water concerns. Meanwhile, with a solid waste generation of 0.207 kg d-1 capita-1 comprising 79.81\% organic fraction, composting becomes the best waste resource recovery option in the area. Pilot-scale studies of composting transformed organic wastes into compost manure rich in nutrients improving the soil quality. Further analysis using a multi-criteria decision-making approach revealed that the public interest in applying these technologies depends on investment costs, additional resources requirements, and governmental policies. With the scope of improved lifestyle and quality, the study proposes more future research over green technologies and their implementation and is also directed towards developing decentralized site-specific rural governmental policies to achieve sustainability goals.

TI  - Depth control modelling and analysis of a subsea shuttle tanker
AB  - A novel subsea shuttle tanker (SST) concept was recently proposed as a cost-effective alternative to subsea pipelines and tanker ships for liquid CO2 transportation between a source facility and a subsea well. It is envisioned that the SST will be deployed to transport CO2 to marginal subsea fields with an annual CO2 storage capacity less than 1 million metric tons; volumes that do not justify a full subsea field development. The SST is designed to be a fully autonomous underwater vessel with a cargo capacity of over 17,000 metric tons. It is 155 m long and it has a 17 m diameter hull. The vessel may operate at a water depth of between 50 to 200 m in a weather-independent environment. Furthermore, it travels at a slow speed for minimal energy consumption and maximal range. During the offloading process, the SST will approach the subsea well and land on the seabed just outside the safety radius of the well. After that, a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) will mate the offloading flowline to the SST, and the offloading process will start. The landing sequence is technically challenging for various reasons and warrants detailed analysis. First, the SST would have limited manoeuvrability due to the large inertia of the vessel and low effectiveness of the hydroplanes to provide steering at low speeds. Second, during the final phase before the SST lands, seabed boundary effects will intensify and lead to increased non-uniform, time-varying and drag-dominated load-effects. Third, the impact forces during landing should be minimised to allow for the lowest design load. Solving these technical challenges is crucial to meet SST's design goals of having the least possible control appendices for maximum efficiency/range, and minimal structural weight for the largest cargo capacity. This paper will describe the development of a fully coupled 2D planar model that considers the most relevant load-effects. This model is developed with the feasibility to implement any control schemes and has the potential to plug observers or control modules in future study. This paper performs open loop test and applies simple control cases to explore the depth control in landing sequence. A feed-forward heading control method that achieves the fastest control response and best path following ability is then proposed based on the results obtained. Copyright Â© 2021 by ASME

TI  - Technology development journey of deepwater technologies portfolio
AB  - In order to meet the challenges of today's evolving oil and gas industry, it is imperative to develop new technologies that can support harsher operational environments such as producing in deepwater safely & reliably. Additionally, the current product price environment adds more complexity and cost challenges to successfully developing new technologies. One of Chevron's key strategies is to differentiate performance through technology. Technology development is performed to reduce uncertainty as well as the risk associated with new technologies. By analysing the system into subsystems and/or components, the risk associated with each new component can be determined and evaluated. Emphasis is placed on subsystems and components with the highest degree of uncertainty because this offers the greatest opportunity for risk reduction. Technology development activities support the company's worldwide operations and major capital projects by developing and deploying technology solutions that drive business growth and efficiency. Chevron's Deepwater business unit is utilizing a portfolio development approach for maturing technologies for a range of Deepwater projects while maintaining enough flexibility to cater to specific project technology requirements. Using a portfolio approach enables better understanding of technology needs and timing, assessment of its current state, and development strategies. The focus of this paper is to describe a process to cost effectively advance a portfolio of technologies for use in offshore deepwater applications. This paper will provide some limited examples to demonstrate the fit-for-purpose technology development approach and tools (i.e. technology gap brainstorm workshop) for technology management in a major capital project environment. In addition, development strategies and lessons learned while managing one of the largest and diverse Deepwater technology portfolios (topsides, subsea and subsurface technologies) will be discussed.

TI  - Osmoregulation, bioenergetics and oxidative stress in coastal marine invertebrates: raising the questions for future research
AB  - Osmoregulation is by no means an energetically cheap process, and its costs have been extensively quantified in terms of respiration and aerobic metabolism. Common products of mitochondrial activity are reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which may cause oxidative stress by degrading key cell components, while playing essential roles in cell homeostasis. Given the delicate equilibrium between pro- and antioxidants in fueling acclimation responses, the need for a thorough understanding of the relationship between salinity-induced oxidative stress and osmoregulation arises as an important issue, especially in the context of global changes and anthropogenic impacts on coastal habitats. This is especially urgent for intertidal/estuarine organisms, which may be subject to drastic salinity and habitat changes, leading to redox imbalance. How do osmoregulation strategies determine energy expenditure, and how do these processes affect organisms in terms of oxidative stress? What mechanisms are used to cope with salinity-induced oxidative stress? This Commentary aims to highlight the main gaps in our knowledge, covering all levels of organization. From an energy-redox perspective, we discuss the link between environmental salinity changes and physiological responses at different levels of biological organization. Future studies should seek to provide a detailed understanding of the relationship between osmoregulatory strategies and redox metabolism, thereby informing conservation physiologists and allowing them to tackle the new challenges imposed by global climate change.

TI  - The role of autonomous underwater vehicles in deepwater life of field integrity management
AB  - Integrity Management of deepwater fields requires routine general visual inspections of critical infrastructure. To date the only means of conducting general visual inspection is through the use of ROVs. Deepwater ROV spreads are large and heavy requiring large support vessels with dynamic positioning capability and a significant number of personnel at sea. The capabilities of unmanned underwater vehicles have been enhanced through developments in Autonomous technology progressing to the point that autonomous underwater vehicles can now routinely conduct general visual inspection of subsea facilities. Benefits of Autonomous inspection include: â€¢ Reduced cost of operations â€¢ Faster inspection â€¢ Automatic Change Detection â€¢ Georegistered inspection data â€¢ Simultaneous operations from a single support vessel â€¢ Large standoff distances from the facility being inspected â€¢ Increased safety of operations â€¢ Reduced environmental impact â€¢ Reduced specification requirements on support vessel â—‹ Smaller footprint â—‹ Dynamic Positioning not required â—‹ Fewer personnel at sea â—‹ Reduced Mobilization Costs â—‹ Faster response to emergency inspections Lockheed Martin's Marlinâ„¢ Autonomous Underwater Vehicle recently completed a series of tests in the US Gulf of Mexico demonstrating autonomous change detection of a fixed offshore platform. Examples of the Marlin's capabilities from these tests are illustrated. Deepwater Field Owners now have a new tool that can bring significant operational and financial benefits to Life of Field Integrity Management. Copyright 2011, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Operation control of photovoltaic/diesel hybrid generating system considering fluctuation of solar radiation
AB  - The exhaust gas emission from marine diesel engines is one of the major environmental issues. The authors have been studying the use of photovoltaic energy for the electric power system on ships. This paper proposes an operation control of a photovoltaic/diesel hybrid generating system for a small ship in consideration of the fluctuating photovoltaic power due to solar radiation. The aim of the control is to minimize the fuel consumption and storage capacity of the battery. The validity of the proposed control method is shown by the numerical simulation based on the experimental data of a photovoltaic system. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Efficient preservation of young terrestrial organic carbon in sandy turbidity-current deposits
AB  - Burial of terrestrial biospheric particulate organic carbon in marine sediments removes CO2 from the atmosphere, regulating climate over geologic time scales. Rivers deliver terrestrial organic carbon to the sea, while turbidity currents transport river sediment further offshore. Previous studies have suggested that most organic carbon resides in muddy marine sediment. However, turbidity currents can carry a significant component of coarser sediment, which is commonly assumed to be organic carbon poor. Here, using data from a Canadian fjord, we show that young woody debris can be rapidly buried in sandy layers of turbidity current deposits (turbidites). These layers have organic carbon contents 10x higher than the overlying mud layer, and overall, woody debris makes up >70\% of the organic carbon preserved in the deposits. Burial of woody debris in sands overlain by mud caps reduces their exposure to oxygen, increasing organic carbon burial efficiency. Sandy turbidity current channels are common in fjords and the deep sea; hence we suggest that previous global organic carbon burial budgets may have been underestimated.

TI  - Incentives to revitalize mature fields in an environmentally safe manner
AB  - California has long been a pioneer in establishing a balance between oil and gas operations and protection of the environment. The State was a major catalyst in the development of modern environmental laws and is continuing that role in its attention to green house gas emissions. These laws have had a profound effect on the management of offshore resources. Oil and gas operators, who serve as stewards of these resources, are finding new ways of utilizing conventional reservoir technologies and demonstrating that successful development can be achieved with limited environmental impacts. Some of these methods include using contractual incentives, government sponsorship, and innovative applications of conventional technologies to promote development in an environmentally safe manner. These methods are not exclusive to California, but may provide opportunities worldwide. This paper will demonstrate how economic incentives such as government contractual agreements and sponsorship provide stimulus for operators to apply off-the-shelf advanced technologies to revitalize mature oil field production. Application of these technologies will be shown in several case studies from California fields such as Wilmington, South Ellwood, and Belmont offshore. These will include: re-alignment of a complex waterflood, identification of bypassed intervals; use of horizontal drilling; reinterpretation of 3D seismic; use of new production logging tools; extended reach drilling from existing offshore infrastructure into a previously abandoned field. Many of the ideas presented in these case studies can be very successfully applied in other parts of the world and provide financial incentives to revitalize mature fields.

TI  - Optimal Configuration and Sizing of Seaport Microgrids including Renewable Energy and Cold Ironingâ€”The Port of Aalborg Case Study
AB  - Microgrids are among the promising green transition technologies that will provide enor-mous benefits to the seaports to manage major concerns over energy crises, environmental challenges, and economic issues. However, creating a good design for the seaport microgrid is a challenging task, considering different objectives, constraints, and uncertainties involved. To ensure the optimal operation of the system, determining the right microgrid configuration and component size at minimum cost is a vital decision at the design stage. This paper aims to design a hybrid system for a seaport microgrid with optimally sized components. The selected case study is the Port of Aalborg, Denmark. The proposed grid-connected structure consists of renewable energy sources (photovoltaic system and wind turbines), an energy storage system, and cold ironing facilities. The seaport architecture is then optimized by utilizing HOMER to meet the maximum load demand by considering important parameters such as solar global horizontal irradiance, temperature, and wind resources. Finally, the best configuration is analyzed in terms of economic feasibility, energy reliability, and environmental impacts. Â© 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Development of a PDC-tricone hybrid technology to solve drilling problems of surface holes in North Africa
AB  - A major oil company started a drilling campaign onshore South Tunisia, where wells call for long, 16-in. diameter surface holes to be drilled through a variety of lithologies that presented several drilling challenges. The challenges in this section start with mud losses which usually require controlled rate of penetration (ROP) to manage the volume of cuttings. The second drilling challenge comes while drilling through clays, which can cause balling of the bit and stabilisers. The third and most difficult drilling challenge is presented when Pyrite and sometimes Chert nodules are encountered. To overcome these challenges, a novel PDC-Tricone hybrid bit technology was designed and tested as a potential solution. Because of its combined cutting structure, it can drill with the efficiency and aggressiveness of a PDC bit, while handling hard nodular formation like a Tricone bit, without suffering any damage. It enabled the operator to drill the entire section in a single run and saved more than 55,000 USD on the first well. Following this run, the bit was modified to increase its aggressiveness and durability, and was run in more wells, confirming the initial success. As the operator and the service company became more confident that the hybrid bit could drill the entire section without suffering damage, the operating parameters were raised to gain higher ROP. Additional improvements were made to adapt to the more demanding conditions, and the PDC-Tricone hybrid bit matched the performance of conventional PDC bits, while generating financial gains for the operator. Based on the success of this campaign, the same bit type was proposed to other operators, drilling offshore Morocco, with the ambitious objective of drilling a long chert-bearing section in one run. This paper describes the development of the PDC-Tricone hybrid bit design, the results of lab testing conducted during this development, design iterations, and the results of its application in North Africa. Detailed performance compared to conventional PDC bits and cost savings are also presented. Copyright 2014, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Oceans as bioenergy pools for methane production using activated methanogens in waste sewage sludge
AB  - The dissolved CO2 that causes ocean acidification has great potential for bioenergy production. In this study, we demonstrate that activated methanogens in waste sewage sludge (WSS) are useful for converting bicarbonate in seawater into methane. These activated methanogens were adapted in different seawater sources for methane production through repeated batch experiments that resulted in an increase of 300-400 fold in the methane yield. During these repeated batch experiments, the microbial communities in WSS adapted to the high salinity of seawater to generate more methane. Microbial community analysis showed the dominance of Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Serrati sp. and methanogens including Methanobacterium sp., Methanosarcina sp., and Methanosaeta concillii. Using a C-13-labeled isotope, we demonstrate that 81\% of the methane is derived from microbial conversion of (NaHCO2)-C-13 in artificial seawater. Therefore, this study shows that oceans, with the largest surface area on Earth, have a potential as a substrate for methane energy production via an acclimated consortium approach.

TI  - Hydrogen for Maritime Application-Quality of Hydrogen Generated Onboard Ship by Electrolysis of Purified Seawater
AB  - Maritime transport is investigating several options to reduce its greenhouse gases and air pollutant emissions. An experimental ship, Energy Observer, is using excess renewable energy to generate onboard hydrogen by electrolysis of purified seawater. As a promising option for storing energy, it can provide on-demand energy to the ship through a hydrogen fuel cell (FC). As hydrogen FCs lifetime and performance are correlated to hydrogen quality, the hydrogen produced onboard needs to be monitored. This study assesses the probability of contaminants presence for this electrolyser, using purified seawater and supports the results with a hydrogen fuel quality analysis from the Energy Observer ship. It demonstrates that an electrolyser using onboard purified seawater can generate hydrogen of a quality compliant with ISO 14687:2019. Additional contaminants (i.e., ions, heavy metal) were also measured. The study highlights the potential contaminants to be monitored and future research on new contaminants from seawater to further develop hydrogen fuel for maritime applications.

TI  - Real time cloud-based automation for formation evaluation optimization, risk mitigation and decarbonization
AB  - Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled upstream exploration and production companies to make better, faster and accurate decisions at any stage of well construction, while reducing operational expenditure and risk, increasing logistic efficiencies. The achieved optimization through digitization at the wellsite will significantly reduce the carbon emissions per well drilled when fully embraced by the industry. In addition, an industry pushed to drill in more challenging environments, they must embrace safer and more practical methods. An increase in prediction techniques, to generate synthetic formation evaluation wellbore logs, has unlocked the ability to implement a combination of predictive and prescriptive analytics with petrophysical and geochemical workflows in real time. The foundation of the real time automation is based on advanced machine learning (ML) techniques that are deployed via cloud connectivity. Three levels of logging precision are defined in the automated workflow based on the data inputs and machine learning models. The first level is the forecasting ahead of the bit that implements advanced machine learning using historical data, aiding proactive operational decisions. The second level has improved precision by incorporating real time drilling measurements and providing a credible contingency to for wellbore logging program. The last level incorporates petrophysical workflows and geochemical measurements to achieve the highest precision for logging prediction in the industry. Supervised and unsupervised machine learning models are presented to demonstrate the path for automation. Precision above 95% in the real time automated workflows was achieved with a combination of physics and advanced machine learning models. The automation of the workflow has assisted with optimization of logging programs utilizing technology with costly lost in hole charges and high rate of tool failures in offshore operations. The optimization has reduced the requirement for logistics associated with logging and eliminated the need for radioactive sources and lithium batteries. Highest precision in logging prediction has been achieved through an automated workflow for real time operations. In addition, the workflow can also be deployed with robotics technology to automate sample collection, leading to increased efficiencies. Â© 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers

TI  - Increased CO2 Relevant to Future Ocean Acidification Alleviates the Sensitivity of a Red Macroalgae to Solar Ultraviolet Irradiance by Modulating the Synergy Between Photosystems II and I
AB  - While intertidal macroalgae are exposed to drastic changes in solar photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) during a diel cycle, and to ocean acidification (OA) associated with increasing CO2 levels, little is known about their photosynthetic performance under the combined influences of these drivers. In this work, we examined the photoprotective strategies controlling electron flow through photosystems II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) in response to solar radiation with or without UVR and an elevated CO2 concentration in the intertidal, commercially important, red macroalgae Pyropia (previously Porphyra) yezoensis. By using chlorophyll fluorescence techniques, we found that high levels of PAR alone induced photoinhibition of the inter-photosystem electron transport carriers, as evidenced by the increase of chlorophyll fluorescence in both the J- and I-steps of Kautsky curves. In the presence of UVR, photoinduced inhibition was mainly identified in the O-2-evolving complex (OEC) and PSII, as evidenced by a significant increase in the variable fluorescence at the K-step (F-k) of Kautsky curves relative to the amplitude of F-J-F-o (W-k) and a decrease of the maximum quantum yield of PSII (F-v/F-m). Such inhibition appeared to ameliorate the function of downstream electron acceptors, protecting PSI from over-reduction. In turn, the stable PSI activity increased the efficiency of cyclic electron transport (CET) around PSI, dissipating excess energy and supplying ATP for CO2 assimilation. When the algal thalli were grown under increased CO2 and OA conditions, the CET activity became further enhanced, which maintained the OEC stability and thus markedly alleviating the UVR-induced photoinhibition. In conclusion, the well-established coordination between PSII and PSI endows P. yezoensis with a highly efficient photochemical performance in response to UVR, especially under the scenario of future increased CO2 levels and OA.

TI  - Low blue carbon storage in eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows on the Pacific Coast of Canada
AB  - Seagrass habitats provide important ecosystem services, including their ability to take up and store substantial amounts of organic carbon, known as 'blue carbon.' However, the paucity of geospatial and carbon storage information along the Pacific Coast of Canada hinders the inclusion of blue carbon storage data in conservation planning and policy development in coastal habitats. We assessed the carbon storage and accumulation rates in three eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows in southern Clayoquot Sound on the Pacific Coast of British Columbia. The intertidal and subtidal portions of each meadow were mapped and sampled to estimate eelgrass density, biomass, and carbon, and sediment cores were analyzed to estimate sediment carbon storage and accumulation rates. Aboveground biomass measurements were consistent with estimates for Z. marina in other regions, with average aboveground carbon biomass estimates of 16.78 g C m-2 and 16.25 g C m-2 in the intertidal and subtidal areas, respectively. However, the estimated aboveground to belowground biomass ratio was an order of magnitude higher than for seagrass species in temperate/tropical areas, largely because belowground biomass was up to 10 times lower than for other Z. marina meadows, averaging 6.17 g C m-2 and 5.03 g C m-2 in the intertidal and subtidal zones, respectively. Sediment carbon concentrations did not exceed 1.30%Corg, and carbon accumulation rates ranged from 2.90-39.61 g Corg m-2 yr-1, decreasing with depth and averaging 10.8Â±5.2 g Corg m-2 yr-1. While sediment carbon stocks were generally higher in the eelgrass meadows relative to non-vegetated reference sites, carbons stocks averaged 1343Â±482 g Corg m-2, substantially less than global averages. These carbon results confirm that eelgrass does contribute to carbon storage in Clayoquot Sound but at lower rates than identified for more tropical seagrasses. By improving the quantification of site-specific carbon dynamics, eelgrass' role in climate change mitigation and conservation planning can be assessed. Â© 2018 Postlethwaite et al.

TI  - A sensor network for long-term monitoring of sediment transport in the coastal region
AB  - We introduce a sensor network suitable for measuring pressure and light transmission in coastal seas over time periods of several months. The purpose is to use the collected data for the investigation of sediment transport processes in the tidal flats of the North Sea in particular during extreme events like storm surges and high tides. The main development objectives were to conceive a modular system that is mobile and can be easily relocated in order to be able to respond quickly to emerging scientific demands. The system design builds up a controller system with CAN bus, which proved to be robust and reliable. Design considerations have been spent on what type of cable could be used under the expected adverse conditions and alternative designs using single buoy deployments have been evaluated as well. The electronic is designed to accommodate a variety of interfaces to be able to integrate the type of sensors that are important for the process study. To that end CAN bus is offering commercially available adapters that facilitate the interfacing process significantly. Special care has been taken to exclude a malfunction of the network if only one sensor fails. The pressure sensor has been selected based on considerations in regard to cost/performance ratio. Minimum requirements exist because of the needed fast and precise resolution in pressure to resolve wave heights. With the selected pressure sensor a prototype underwater device has been constructed and lab and field tests were carried out. A newly developed hyperspectral transmissometer allows deriving data on suspended matter concentration and size distribution. The sensor casing has been specifically designed to protect against biofouling. The capsulated sensors get only in contact with seawater on demand, e. g. prior to a storm surge. The sensor system will result in a better understanding of the dynamics of sediment transport and changes of seafloor morphology which cannot be observed with conventional methods during storm events. First results from deployments and algorithms for data processing algorithms are presented.

TI  - A proteomic analysis of the effect of ocean acidification on the haemocyte proteome of the South African abalone Haliotis midae
AB  - As a result of increasing CO2 emissions and the prevalence of global climate change, ocean acidification (OA) is becoming more pervasive, affecting many trophic levels, particularly those that rely on succinctly balanced ocean chemistry. This ultimately threatens community structures, as well as the future sustainability of the fishing/aquaculture industry. Understanding the molecular stress response of key organisms will aid in predicting their future survivability under changing environmental conditions. This study sought to elucidate the molecular stress response of the South African abalone, Haliotis midae, an understudied organism with high economic value, utilising a high throughput iTRAQ-based proteomics methodology. Adult abalone were exposed to control (pH 7.9) and experimental (pH 7.5) conditions for 12, 72 and 168 h, following which protein was isolated from sampled haemocytes and subsequently processed. iTRAQ-labelled peptides were analysed using mass spectrometry, while an array of bioinformatics tools was utilised for analysing the proteomic data. COG analysis identified â€œCytoskeletonâ€, â€œTranslation, ribosomal structure and biogenesisâ€, â€œPost-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperonesâ€, and â€œIntracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transportâ€ to be the most enriched functional classes, while statistical analysis identified a total of 33 up-regulated and 23 down-regulated effectors of OA stress in abalone. Several of the up-regulated proteins that were identified function in central metabolism (ENO1, PGK, DUOX1, GPD2), the stress/immune response (CAMKI, HSPA5/GRP78, MAPKI), and cytoskeleton, protein sorting and signal transduction (IQGAP1, MYO9B, TLN1, RDX, TCP-1/CCT, SNX6, CHMP1a, VPS13a). Protein-protein interactions were predicted using STRING DB, Cytoscape and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, providing a model of the effects of OA on the H. midae haemocyte proteome. The data indicated that H. midae underwent a metabolic shift under OA conditions to utilize more energy-efficient mechanisms of ATP generation, while attempts at restoring haemocyte stabilisation and homeostasis were reflected by up-regulation of oxidative stress and cytoskeletal proteins. Our results support other molluscan studies that report a complex array of overlapping functions of both the stress and immune response systems. This interplay of the mounted stress and immune response is maintained and observed through the up-regulation of proteins involved in protein synthesis and turnover, as well as intracellular signalling and transport. The data presented in this study highlight the value of employing sensitive and robust -omics technologies for assessing the effects of changing environmental conditions on marine organisms.

This oceanic uptake of CO2 leads to a change in marine carbonate chemistry resulting in a decrease of seawater pH and carbonate ion concentration, a process commonly called "Ocean Acidification". Salinity data are key for assessing the marine carbonate system, and new space-based salinity measurements will enable the development of novel space-based ocean acidification assessment. Recent studies have highlighted the need to develop new in situ technology for monitoring ocean acidification, but the potential capabilities of space-based measurements remain largely untapped. Routine measurements from space can provide quasi-synoptic, reproducible data for investigating processes on global scales; they may also be the most efficient way to monitor the ocean surface. As the carbon cycle is dominantly controlled by the balance between the biological and solubility carbon pumps, innovative ethods to exploit existing satellite sea surface temperature and ocean color, and new satellite sea surface salinity measurements, are needed and will enable frequent assessment of ocean acidification parameters over large spatial scales.

TI  - The Contribution of Subtidal Seagrass Meadows to the Total Carbon Stocks of Gazi Bay, Kenya
AB  - Seagrass beds occur globally in both intertidal and subtidal zones within shallow marine environments, such as bays and estuaries. These important ecosystems support fisheries production, attenuate strong wave energies, support human livelihoods and sequester large amounts of CO2 that may help mitigate the effects of climate change. At present, there is increased global interest in understanding how these ecosystems could help alleviate the challenges likely to face humanity and the environment into the future. Unlike other blue carbon ecosystems, i.e., mangroves and saltmarshes, seagrasses are less understood, especially regarding their contribution to the carbon dynamics. This is particularly true in regions with less attention and limited resources. Paucity of information is even more relevant for the subtidal meadows that are less accessible. In Kenya, much of the available information on seagrasses comes from Gazi Bay, where the focus has been on the extensive intertidal meadows. As is the case with other regions, there remains a paucity of information on subtidal meadows. This limits our understanding of the overall contribution of seagrasses in carbon capture and storage. This study provides the first assessment of the species composition and variation in carbon storage capacity of subtidal seagrass meadows within Gazi Bay. Nine seagrass species, comprising of Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodocea serrulata, Enhalus acoroides, Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis, Halophila stipulacea, Syringodium isoetifolium, Thalassia hemprichii, and Thalassodendron ciliatum, were found. Organic carbon stocks varied between species and pools, with the mean below ground vegetation carbon (bgc) stocks (5.1 +/- 0.7 Mg C ha(-1)) being more than three times greater than above ground carbon (agc) stocks (0.5 +/- 0.1 Mg C ha(-1)). Mean sediment organic carbon stock (sed C-org) of the subtidal seagrass beds was 113 +/- 8 Mg C ha(-1). Combining this new knowledge with existing data from the intertidal and mangrove fringed areas, we estimate the total seagrass ecosystem organic carbon stocks in the bay to be 196,721 Mg C, with the intertidal seagrasses storing about 119,790 Mg C (61\%), followed by the subtidal seagrasses 55,742 Mg C (28\%) and seagrasses in the mangrove fringed creeks storing 21,189 Mg C (11\%). These findings are important in highlighting the need to protect subtidal seagrass meadows and for building a national and global data base on seagrass contribution to global carbon dynamics.

TI  - Carbon Sink Estimation of Mangrove Vegetation Using Remote Sensing in Segara Anakan, Cilacap
AB  - Worldwide global warming occurs because of increasing carbon dioxide (CO2 ) in the atmosphere. Segara Anakan, the largest mangrove forest in Java Island, has the highest potential as a carbon sink in the tropics. This study aimed to quantify the area and density of mangrove forests in Segara Anakan and to estimate their potentials as carbon sink based on Sentinel-2A imagery. In this study, data from Sentinel 2A satellite imagery was processed and validated with field survey results. The results showed that Segara Anakan had mangrove forests covering an area of 5,481.64 ha in 2019 with the sparse density covered 706.92 ha, medium density covered of 2,526.80 ha, and high density covered 2,848.60 ha. The results of mangrove density were validated using Table Confusion Matrix and using correlation coefficient value (r) by comparing field measurement and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) algorithm. The accuracy for mangrove density was 86.92% with r-value 0.85. Mangrove in Segara Anakan has the ability to absorb 8.56 Mega gram of carbon per hectare. Segara Anakan mangroves have the potential to absorb high level of carbon, so we should maintain their sustainability. Â© 2022 Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Universitas Airlangga.

TI  - The marine gas turbine regenerator material and fabrication considerations
AB  - Gas turbine heat exchangers of the stationary and rotary types are used to increase power-plant thermal efficiency. Economic justification for the use of regenerative equipment depends on the criteria of initial cost and component life. Materials selection and fabricating techniques must be in accord with cost and life objectives. In this regard, the U. S. Navy Ship Systems Command has sponsored a program to investigate the particular problems associated with marine gas turbine heat exchangers. This paper presents the results of the investigation to date. Â© 1967 by ASME.

TI  - Seasonal air-sea CO2 fluxes in the southern California Current off the Baja California Peninsula (Mexico)
AB  - Seasonal climatology of air-sea CO2 exchange was estimated from in situ sea surface CO2 partial pressure, temperature, salinity, and satellite wind data obtained from 2004 to 2011 in the southern region of the California Current, off the Baja California Peninsula (Mexico). The average annual CO2 flux indicates that the study area is a source of CO2 to the atmosphere (0.65 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). It changes from being a source in summer (2.33 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and autumn (0.92 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) to acting as a sink in winter (-0.26 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and spring (-0.37 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). The area to the north of latitud 28 degrees N (off Punta Eugenia) is a CO2 sink (-0.42 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), whereas the area to the south of this latitude is a source of CO2 to the atmosphere (1.80 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), mostly due to thermodynamic effects. The northern coastal zone is a permanent CO2 sink (-1.29 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). During the 2004 El Nino event the whole area contributed 2.00 mmol m(-2) d(-1) of CO2 to the atmosphere, but during the 2011 La Nina the ocean absorbed 5.30 mmol m(-2) d(-1) as a result of physical and biological dynamics. The seasonal cycle is dominated by temperature rather than biological effects, except in the northern coastal area. It is necessary to continue with in situ measurements of the CO2 system to have solid foundations to estimate the effect of the long-term increase in dissolved inorganic carbon on marine organisms.

TI  - Evolution of blue carbon trading of China's marine ranching under the blue carbon special subsidy mechanism
AB  - The carbon sequestration function of marine ranching (MR) is an important part of the carbon cycle. China carrying out blue carbon trading (BCT) of MR will improve the carbon trading mechanism, protect the blue carbon ecosystem, and promote the realization of carbon neutrality. We construct an evolutionary game model comprising three players interacting under a mixed carbon policy, namely the Chinese local government, MR, and firms that demand blue carbon. We analyze four possible stable points and numerically simulate the main parameters such as the subsidy intensity, blue carbon price, and carbon tax standard, and discuss the evolution path of each player under the blue carbon special subsidy mechanism. We find that the local government providing special subsidies for BCT is essential for building a blue carbon market. Differentiated subsidies and taxes can be implemented for different types of MR to strengthen the carbon sequestration enthusiasm of MR. In the initial stage of BCT, the subsidized blue carbon price should be lower than the carbon tax standard; after building the blue carbon market, the subsidized blue carbon price can be adjusted to be the same as the carbon tax standard. Moreover, it is necessary to research and develop supporting management and monitoring facilities for MR to maintain the blue carbon ecosystem's stability and avoid the positive feedback effect of the carbon cycle.

TI  - Effects of CO2 on marine fish: Larvae and adults
AB  - CO2-enriched seawater was far more toxic to eggs and larvae of a marine fish, silver seabream, Pagrus major, than HCl-acidified seawater when tested at the same seawater pH. Data on the effects of acidified seawater can therefore not be used to estimate the toxicity of CO2, as has been done in earlier studies. Ontogenetic changes in CO2 tolerance of two marine bony fishes (Pag. major and Japanese sillago, Sillago japonica) showed a similar, characteristic pattern: the cleavage and juvenile stages were most susceptible, whereas the preflexion and flexion stages were much more tolerant to CO2. Adult Japanese amberjack, Seriola quinqueradiata, and bastard halibut,Paralichthys olivaceus, died within 8 and 48 h, respectively, during exposure to seawater equilibrated with 5% CO2. Only 20% of a cartilaginous fish, starspotted smooth-hound, Mustelus manazo died at 7% CO2 within 72 h. Arterial pH initially decreased but completely recovered within 1-24 h for Ser. quinqueradiata and Par. olivaceus at 1 and 3% CO2, but the recovery was slower and complete only at 1% for M. manazo. During exposure to 5% CO2, Par. olivaceus died after arterial pH had been completely restored. Exposure to 5% CO2 rapidly depressed the cardiac output of Ser. quinqueradiata, while 1% CO2 had no effect. Both levels of ambient CO2 had no effect on blood O2 levels. We tentatively conclude that cardiac failure is important in the mechanisms by which CO2 kills fish. High CO2 levels near injection points during CO2 ocean sequestration are likely to have acute deleterious effects on both larvae and adults of marine fishes.

TI  - Effect of Agricultural Feedstock to Energy Conversion Rate on Bioenergy and GHG Emissions
AB  - Taiwan is eager to develop renewable energy because it is vulnerable to energy price distortion and ocean level rise. Previous studies show bioenergy technologies can be applied mutually, but pay little attention on feedstocks to energy conversion rate, which has potential influences on policy making in renewable energy and environment. This study employs a price endogenous mathematical programming model to simultaneously simulate the market operations under various feedstocks to energy conversion rates, energy prices, and greenhouse gas (GHG) prices. The result shows pyrolysis-based electricity can reach up to 2.75 billion kWh annually, but it will be driven out at low conversion rate and high GHG price. Pyrolysis plus biochar application will be the optimal option in terms of carbon sequestration. Market valuation on potential threats of extreme weather could have substantial influences on ethanol and renewable electricity generation. To achieve aimed GHG emission reduction and/or bioenergy production, government intervention may be involved to align the market operation with Taiwan's environmental policy.

TI  - Mangrove blue carbon strategies for climate change mitigation are most effective at the national scale
AB  - Carbon fixed by vegetated coastal ecosystems (blue carbon) can mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions, though its effectiveness differs with the spatial scale of interest. A literature review compiling carbon sequestration rates within key ecosystems confirms that blue carbon ecosystems are the most efficient natural carbon sinks at the plot scale, though some overlooked biogeochemical processes may lead to overestimation. Moreover, the limited spatial extent of coastal habitats minimizes their potential at the global scale, only buffering 0.42% of the global fossil fuel carbon emissions in 2014. Still, blue carbon plays a role for countries with moderate fossil fuel emissions and extensive coastlines. In 2014, mangroves mitigated greater than 1% of national fossil fuel emissions for countries such as Bangladesh, Colombia and Nigeria. Considering that the Paris Agreement is based on nationally determined contributions, we propose that mangrove blue carbon may contribute to climate change mitigation at this scale in some instances alongside other blue carbon ecosystems.

TI  - Challenges for offshore transport of anthropogenic carbon dioxide
AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is recognised as having a significant role to play in reducing carbon dioxide emissions and tackling climate change. In CCS schemes, carbon dioxide is captured from anthropogenic sources and transported to suitable sites either for EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) or storage. Globally, the largest source Of CO2 is from power generation, therefore the initial projects proposed for CCS in the UK are from power plant. There are various technologies for capturing CO2 from power stations, however the captured CO2 can contain significant amounts of impurities. The presence of the impurities in the CO2 stream has an effect on the requirements for pipeline transportation and can change such factors as the flow properties, the decompression characteristics and the solubility of water in the mixture. Although transport Of CO2 by pipeline is not new technology, and has been implemented in the USA for over 30 years, the effect of these impurities is not fully understood. The UK is in the advantageous position of having natural sinks for CO2 available offshore in the North and Irish Sea, which can be used for either EOR or storage. Therefore CCS implementation in the UK will involve transport of anthropogenic carbon dioxide from power stations to offshore sinks. All of the current experience with CO2 pipeline transport has been onshore, predominantly from near pure natural sources and therefore this is also a new challenge. This state-of the-art review paper will: discuss the key technical factors presented by the transport Of CO2 from power plant, including the effects of impurities on the design and operation of pipelines, compare and contrast the current experience of transporting CO2 onshore with the proposed transport onshore and offshore in the UK and identify the technical and regulatory challenges, present the results of initial modelling work to demonstrate the effects of the key variables on the development of a CO2 transport system in the UK.

TI  - Quantifying the effect of CO2-fertilized vegetation on future global climate and carbon dynamics
AB  - Climate and the global carbon cycle are a tightly coupled system where changes in climate affect exchange of atmospheric CO2 with the land biosphere and the ocean, and vice-versa. In particular, the response of the land biosphere to the ongoing increase in atmospheric CO2 is not well understood. To evaluate the approximate upper and lower limits of land carbon uptake, we perform simulations using a comprehensive climate-carbon model. In one case the land biosphere is vigorously fertilized by added CO2 and sequesters carbon throughout the 21st century. In a second case, CO2 fertilization saturates in year 2000; here the land becomes an additional source of CO2 by 2050. The predicted atmospheric CO2 concentration at year 2100 differs by 40% between the two cases. We show that current uncertainties preclude determination of whether the land biosphere will amplify or damp atmospheric CO2 increases by the end of the century.

TI  - Robust technology implementation process applied to a first deepwater electrical heating ready system
AB  - The development and implementation of new technology within the execution schedule and finance model of a deepwater subsea project requires attention to design detail, and a culture of meticulous qualification and verification practice. Challenges faced by project leadership and project teams occur in the merging of new technology product(s) into the timeline allocated for delivering the more conventional parts of a subsea system in the deepwater environment. The achievement of project delivery and production start-up on time and on budget coupled with a unified and demonstrable success rating for using such technology are of increasing importance for venture teams, partners, and shareholders. This paper addresses one process methodology adopted by Shell EP Projects to support guaranteed delivery of technology products to customers, namely Shell Exploration and Production Company (SEPCo) and BP Exploration &amp; Production Inc. (BP) for the Nakika Project. Novel subsea technology has been applied strategically as an enabler to develop aspects of the Na Kika Project in the Gulf of Mexico in water depths between 5800 ft to 7000 ft. See Figure 1 showing the Na Kika North area subsea architecture. This process is applied to the Nakika Electrical Heating Ready System, comprising principally of the Electrical Heating Pipe-in-Pipe (EHPIP) system and the ready-to-deploy modular Electrical Heating Ready Intervention System (EHRIS)1. The Shell EP Projects Subsea and Pipelines Group comprise a broad matrix of systems; products; pipelines; and well completion engineers, and a project leadership skill base. This engineering and project execution workforce are dedicated to regional and international deepwater and ultra deep water ventures using existing and new technology. The work is completed in close collaboration with technical skills in the Shell EP Projects Civil and Marine Group and Shell Global Solutions. The strength of technology product ownership and interaction across the Group collectively delivers robust solutions. The foundation of this collaborative effort and the process adopted serves to encourage continued technology implementation by customers in deepwater and ultra deep projects. Figure 2 outlines the broad division of work. In reviewing the application of this process, the paper describes the components of the Electrical Heating Ready System to evidence the success with which a systemic qualification and verification culture have contributed to project delivery.

TI  - Intercomparison of shipboard and moored CARIOCA buoy seawater fCO2 measurements in the Sargasso Sea
AB  - The ocean is an important sink for carbon and heat, yet high-resolution measurements of biogeochemical properties relevant to global climate change are being made only sporadically in the ocean at present. There is a growing need for automated, real-time, long-term measurements of CO2 in the ocean using a network of sensors, strategically placed on ships, moorings, free-drifting buoys and autonomous remotely operated vehicles. The ground-truthing of new sensor technologies is a vital component of present and future efforts to monitor changes in the ocean carbon cycle and air-sea exchange of CO2. A comparison of a moored Carbon Interface Ocean Atmosphere (CARIOCA) buoy and shipboard fugacity of CO2 (fCO2) measurements was conducted in the western North Atlantic during two extended periods (&gt; 1 month) in 1997. The CARIOCA buoy was deployed on the Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM), which is located 5 km north of the site of the US Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS). The high frequency of sampling revealed that temperature and fCO2 responded to physical forcing by the atmosphere on timescales from diurnal to 4-8 days. Concurrent with the deployments of the CARIOCA buoy, frequent measurements of surface fCO2 were made from the R/V Weatherbird II during opportunistic visits to the BTM and BATS sites, providing a direct calibration of the CARIOCA buoy fCO2 data. Although, the in situ ground-truthing of the CARIOCA buoy was complicated by diurnal processes, sub-mesoscale and fine-scale variability, the CARIOCA buoy fCO2 data was accurate within 3 Â± 6 Î¼atm of shipboard fCO2 data for periods up to 50 days. Longer-term assessments were not possible due to the CARIOCA buoy breaking free of the BTM and drifting into waters with different fCO2-temperature properties. Strategies are put forward for future calibration of other in situ sensors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Flow fluctuation behaviors of single-phase forced circulation under rolling conditions
AB  - Marine reactors are received increasing attention recently in the field of ocean engineering. The effect of platform motion on the coolant flow of an offshore nuclear power plants is very complicated, which is required further analysis. In this paper, effects of rolling motion on single-phase flow fluctuation with different loops were investigated experimentally. And a mathematical model was also developed to study the mechanism of the influence of rolling motion on flow fluctuation with different pressure head, rolling parameters and layouts of flow loops. For the closed loop, the flow rate was adjusted by two ways, i.e. regulating the pump rotation speed and changing the state of regulating valve. While for the opened loop, the pressure head was always supplied by elevated water tank. The Reynolds number ranged from 300 to 8000, and ranges of the rolling period and amplitude were 8-20 s and 10-30, respectively. The results show that increase of the loop resistance and pressure head results in smaller flow fluctuation amplitudes. Effects of rolling motion on single-phase flow fluctuation weaken as the oscillatory pressure drop decreases or the pressure head increases. If the pressure head is high enough, the effect of rolling motion on flow fluctuation could be neglected. Rolling motions influence the flow fluctuation behaviors in different ways for the opened loop and the closed loop, due to the inequable oscillatory pressure drop. The flow fluctuation model shows a good agreement with the experiments and the analyzing method is expected to other oscillating flow system. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Patch-based piezoelectric energy harvesting on a marine boat exposed to wave-induced loads
AB  - According to recent research studies, global fuel energy consumption will keep on increasing and will result in increase in carbon emission and significant decrease of fuel reserve at a higher rate. Therefore, carbon-neutral energy sources and energy harvesting technologies have been attracted more attention of researchers. One of the promising energy harvesting technologies is vibration-based energy harvesting from wave energy with the use of piezoelectric materials. Piezoelectric transducers are used extensively to obtain energy from vibration sources with their inherent capability of electromechanical coupling and high power density. Cantilever piezoelectric beams are commonly used in the field of piezoelectric energy harvesting. However, cantilever harvesters require clamping as well as proof mass and are not practical to be implemented in complex structures such as marine platforms. In this study, an embedded patch-based energy harvesting on a marine composite boat was proposed and the performance of the harvester exposed to wave-induced loads was investigated. Piezoceramics (PZT) and ZnO were regarded for the patch material. An electromechanical model of the Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) boat integrated with the piezoelectric patches was developed, the patches were placed on the port bow side of the boat, below and above the waterline, hence, the efficiency of the patches according to their location was investigated and electrical power was obtained by optimizing the load resistances from a variety of load resistance values. Thus, a comparative study of the effectiveness of both piezoelectric materials was carried out. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Advances, opportunities, and challenges of hydrogen and oxygen production from seawater electrolysis: An electrocatalysis perspective
AB  - With increasing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the importance of developing renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels has become a vital global task. Hydrogen produced via water electrolysis powered by renewable energy systems at a large scale is an essential measure to reduce greenhouse gas and particulate emissions. Electrolysers use a substantial amount of water (mainly freshwater) to produce hydrogen and oxygen at the cathode, and anode, respectively. However, seawater is preferred because it is the most abundant water resource. Although many R&D efforts on seawater electrolysis have been carried out since the 1970s, the barriers are the undesired chlorine gas evolution reaction at the anode, and corrosion induced by chloride ions. Unlike the available data for electrocatalyst materials based upon platinum group metals in pure solutions, limited data is available for electrocatalysts in seawater. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new electrocatalysts for seawater electrolysis. Â© 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Systems engineering project: Zero population growth by 2020
AB  - The scientific conclusion as to the primary cause of global warming is human beings. Human use of fossil fuels causes carbon dioxide emissions and the resultant green house effect. To avoid the fast approaching point of global melt down will require halting the population growth. No amount of technological advances to clean emissions will preclude the accumulation of gases in our atmosphere without stabilizing the population causing these emissions. The United Nations (UN) estimate for world population by 2050 is 10.5 billion, a prediction of doom. The current world population is 6.7 billion, if growth slows down to 7.5 billion by 2050 global warming may stabilize. The consequences of global warming are evident today, such as melting of the polar caps, resultant floods and rising coastal waters. To stabilize the situation and avoid disaster something must be done. Imagine you are the Systems Engineer selected to propose the 'Zero Population Growth by 2020' project.

As wells have become more complex, particularly in the deepwater environment then the actual on bottom drilling time has reduced to less than 15% of total rig time (Blacklaw: SPE GCS Annual Drilling Symposium. April, 2016). The casing and liner running, cementing and completion installation related activities have, however, not had those same benfits. They instead have had to rely on surface measurements and modeling. As wells have become more complex and windows of operations tighter there are multiple case histories where these models and surface measurements are significantly diverging from what is actually happening downhole.

TI  - Experimental Investigation of the Hydraulic Performance of Breakwater Structures with Geotextile Armor Units
AB  - Geotextile sand containers (GSCs) gained popularity recently as a modern age coastal protection measure. Its usability as an ecofriendly alternative for traditional breakwaters overcomes issues such as scarcity and quarrying prohibition of natural rocks. The current work involves a 1:30 scaled physical experimentation on the hydraulic performance of an emerged, nonovertopping breakwater model with GSCs. Four configurations of GSC structures are analyzed for their runup, rundown, and reflection characteristics confining to wave parameters of Mangaluru. The study revealed that the reflection coefficient (K-r) for GSC structures could range from 0.26 to 0.69. In addition, reducing GSC fill percentage from 100 to 80 is found to be more effective (up to 64\%) in reducing reflection, runup, and rundown rates, than altering GSC size. These results can serve as a practical guideline for designing GSC breakwaters.

TI  - Integrated motion, stability, and variable load design of the trendsetter class semisubmersible "zane barnes"
AB  - The "Zone Barnes" project began as an effort to incorporate the most desirable features of new and existing technology into a deep water application. The effort to modify the proven designs of the third generation of semis that have operated in water depths up to 3000' was unsuccessful due to their inherent limitations of strength, variable load capacity, and seakeeping. Variable load requirements such as riser and tubular storage, power plant size, and diving and production facilities, to name but a few, dictate space requirements. Deck area is probably the most critical element in the design spiral, as it affects vessel size (displacement), structural limitations, motions, and environmental loads. The basic vessel features that stood out as uncompromised requirements were: 1. Water depth capability to 5000' 2. High variable deck load in all operating conditions. 3. Motions equal to or better than the best existing semisubmersibles. 4. "ASEMOS" type mooring system with thruster assist. 5. Compliance of major features to all existing and proposed major regulatory body requirements. Â© 1988 Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Design through simulation: Finite element capabilities for ocean engineering
AB  - Design optimization and testing of marine technology and offshore structures, such as risers, moorings, or manned and unmanned submersibles is a challenge. This is due to many factors including weather, costly ship time, and the need for experienced off-shore personnel. Nevertheless, early stage design optimization is critical to a project's success. There is a need for simulation facilities that can capture the complexity and the non-linear dynamics of large mechanical and structural systems, and provide accurate assessment of design variations. This article outlines the development of a nonlinear simulation tool for modeling mechanical systems and structures in the ocean. The framework design and simulation set-up procedures are discussed. The main components of the simulator, a nonlinear finite element cable model and a rigid body model, are discussed. Next, this paper shows how these fundamental models are used to simulate risers, remotely operated vehicle (ROV) umbilicals, and mooring lines. In addition, a module that produces the effects of vortex induced vibration (VIV) based on recent developments on the wake oscillator model is presented. Payin and payout simulations of a ROV tether are also presented to demonstrate the use of the variable-length capabilities of the cable model. Lastly, this paper discusses how ROV instrumentation can be simulated, permitting the design and refinement of instrumentation processing algorithms, such as a Kalman filter, or controllers.

TI  - Design and setup of a hybrid solar seawater desalination system: The AQUASOL Project
AB  - Despite the energy efficiency advances reached during the last decade, seawater desalination continues to be an intensive fossil energy consumer. In the current global framework, with growing oil price instability and the environmental requirements derived from compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, the sustainability of this technological solution inevitably passes through continued improvement of energy efficiency of the physical processes involved, as well as the use of renewable energy resources, such as for example, solar energy. In 2002, the R&D European Project AQUASOL was initiated at the Plataforma Solar de AlmerÃ­a for the purpose of improving the existing solar thermal seawater desalination technology based on the multi-effect distillation process. After the conclusion of the research phase, a completely new desalination system has been designed and its implementation has been initiated for testing during the demonstration phase. This paper describes the final design of the overall system, and all the erection work performed.

TI  - A synthesis of modern organic carbon accumulation rates in coastal and aquatic inland ecosystems
AB  - Organic carbon accumulation in the sediments of inland aquatic and coastal ecosystems is an important process in the global carbon budget that is subject to intense human modification. To date, research has focused on quantifying accumulation rates in individual or groups of aquatic ecosystems to quantify the aquatic carbon sinks. However, there hasn't been a synthesis of rates across aquatic ecosystem to address the variability in rates within and among ecosystems types. Doing so would identify gaps in our understanding of accumulation rates and potentially reveal carbon sinks vulnerable to change. We synthesized accumulation rates from the literature, compiling 464 rate measurements from 103 studies of carbon accumulated in the modern period (ca. 200 years). Accumulation rates from the literature spanned four orders of magnitude varying substantially within and among ecosystem categories, with mean estimates for ecosystem categories ranging from 15.6 to 73.2 g C m(-2) y(-1) within ecosystem categories. With the exception of lakes, mean accumulation rates were poorly constrained due to high variability and paucity of data. Despite the high uncertainty, the estimates of modern accumulation rate compiled here are an important step for constructing carbon budgets and predicting future change.

TI  - Improving offshore Helicopter operability & safety
AB  - Helicopter services have been used by the offshore industry for decades. Traditionally offshore production platforms were fixed. For drilling, installation and work-over, large and stable semi submersibles were deployed. Nowadays helicopters have to operate on FPSO's, drillships and relative small well intervention and installation vessels. In countries around the North Sea, Civil Aviation Authorities (CAA) and helicopter operators are operating under a strict regime; for "small" vessels helicopters are only allowed to land and remain on deck if pitch and roll angles are less than 2Â° and the average heave rate of the largest wave is less than 1 m/s for the last 20 minutes. MARIN technicians noted the sensitivity of offshore operations to these restrictions when they had to remain on standby at a Norwegian heliport for a week awaiting favourable landing conditions before flying to the destination vessel. The week wait sparked the incentive to investigate helicopter workability on ships and possibilities to extend that. A workability analysis for an 80 m light well intervention vessel operating offshore Norway, showed that the downtime for helicopter operations in winter time assuming good visibility may drop to 70 and 90% depending on the relative wave direction[1]. Helicopter availability is essential for an economic operation of these vessels as the alternative is to leave station and return to shore which can take days depending on the working area. The Helicopter Operations for Offshore Ships (HELIOS) project aims on decreasing the 'downtime' for offshore helicopter operations while at least maintaining the present safety standards. This is achieved by at first finding options to improve and optimize operations inside the existing standards and secondly by researching available "new technology" to increase safety and operability. Important conclusions are that; 1) Helicopter operability is dominated by "stability on deck" considerations. 2) Recent incidents suggest safety will be improved mostly by improving the pilot's situational awareness during approach and landing. 3) Many technical solutions are available to improve safety and operability of the isolated stages in a helicopter operation. 4) A formal regulatory framework for helicopter ship operations is missing, so introduction of dedicated new technology can be done as it can be in the regular aviation world. 5) Actual introduction of technology requires technology pull from offshore oil companies in order to start certification procedures, enter trial and acceptation procedures with pilots and adopt new technology in the standing procedures. This paper highlights how safety could improve directly by increasing situational awareness during approach and landing and how operability could improve by raising on deck stability with deck lock systems and easing landing limits to the actual touch down limitations.

TI  - PM and PAHs emissions of ship auxiliary engine fuelled with waste cooking oil biodiesel and marine gas oil
AB  - Clean fuels are recommended for ships at berth to reduce air pollutant emissions. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel application on board with regard to particle matter (PM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions. An experiment was conducted on a marine auxiliary engine for three different fuels: WCO biodiesel, formulation blends with marine gas oil (MGO) and neat MGO. Results revealed that WCO biodiesel could reduce PM and PAHs emissions. WCO exhaust also exhibited differences in PAH profile and phase distribution as compared to MGO, depending on the operation modes and the proportion of biodiesel in the formulation blends. Consequently, WCO biodiesel could dramatically reduce the total carcinogenic potencies related to PAHs of exhausts. Moreover, PAH source recognition pair ratios of tested fuels were observed to deviate from the widely accepted values. This study highlights that WCO biodiesel is a cleaner fuel for operating ship auxiliary engines with respect to PM and PAHs emissions and has the potential to moderate the severe effects of PM and PAHs on an air of coastal areas.

This would help ecological restoration and aesthetic improvement in many cases, and also increase productivity in the case of marine culture ponds. For these reasons, a device designed to promote seawater renewal in coastal water bodies is presented. This apparatus is powered by wave energy, and was developed and patented by the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The device has the following features: a simple design, the absence of submerged moving parts, a deliver of about 0.5 m"SUP 3" /s of seawater, a reduced operational cost, and low maintenance.

TI  - ICL-based mid-infrared carbon dioxide sensor system for deep-sea natural gas hydrate exploration
AB  - For deep-sea natural gas hydrate exploration, highly sensitive detection of the dissolved gas in seawater near the seabed is significant because it requires the sensor system to be small in size, low in power consumption, and high in sensitivity. A mid-infrared sensor system was developed to detect dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) in sea-water, while employing a 4319 nm continuous-wave interband cascade laser (ICL) and a multi-pass gas cell (MPGC) with a 29.8 m optical path length. A compact rectilinear optical structure was proposed by using the free-space-emitting ICL and tunable laser absorption spectroscopy (TLAS). This leads to a minimized sensor size and a simple optical alignment for deep-sea operation A strong CO2 absorption line, located at 2315.19 cm(-1) and a weak 2315.28 cm(-1) line and at a low pressure of 40 Ton, was targeted for low- and high-concentration CO2 detection within a concentration range of 0-1000 pans per billion by volume (ppbv) and 0-40 parts per million by volume (ppmv), respectively. The limit of detection (LoD) was assessed to be 0.72 ppbv at an averaging time of 2 s, and the response time was measured to be similar to 30 s at a flow rate of similar to 180 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm). Deployment of the CO2 sensor combined with a gas-liquid separator was carried out for the CO2 detection in the gas extracted from water, which validated the reported sensor system's potential application for deep-sea natural gas hydrate exploration.

TI  - The relationship between a â€˜polluter paysâ€™ approach to carbon capture, regional policy and â€˜just transitionâ€™ employment agendas
AB  - Policy makers in a number of nations are currently developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) as an industrial decarbonisation solution, linking capture potential in industry clusters to domestic or overseas offshore storage capacity. However, the design, focus and timeframe for policy support are proving challenging in countries like the UK, where industry actors are concerned about the competitiveness implications of additional operational capital costs, while government aims to offer only transitory policy support. Policy-facing research is required to understand the drivers, nature and extent of potential competitiveness loss from adopting carbon capture in specific industry and country contexts, along with the impacts of policy decisions in other countries and of possible future technology improvements. We consider the case of the UK chemicals industry, using an economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. This highlights how macroeconomic and sectoral impacts of concern under regional, industry and climate policy agendas depend on domestic and export demand responses to changing industry prices. A crucial question is whether capture costs are similarly reflected in international prices. We identify a risk of policy commitment to â€˜polluter paysâ€™ having sustained negative outcomes for capture firms, along with offshoring/leakage of jobs and GDP, and associated emissions, as demand shifts to lower cost overseas production. However, such costs could be reduced, and some capture industry gains realised, if competitors in other nations ultimately follow in bearing similar costs and particularly if â€˜early moverâ€™ action enables firms to make efficiency gains and build comparative advantage in operational carbon capture. Key policy insights A â€˜polluter paysâ€™ approach to industrial carbon capture risks triggering potential â€˜offshoringâ€™ of manufacturing activity in all timeframes where increased operational costs reduce the relative competitiveness of capture firms. A border tax risks worse industry and wider economy outcomes, where domestic production is intensive in imports of the commodity in question. Transitory policy support should focus on enabling capture firms to build efficiency in using carbon capture equipment while sustaining competitiveness and jobs within regional industry clusters. Opportunities should be explored to develop comparative advantage where policy activity involves â€˜early moverâ€™ action on carbon capture. Â© 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Review of incumbent and emerging LNG Regasification technologies part 1 of 2: Onshore terminals
AB  - Today's energy landscape is changing. Natural gas has become the fuel of choice for power generation due to its relatively clean combustion and ease of transportation. The selection of an LNG regasification technology depends on a host of factors including plant site location, climatic conditions and desired throughput capacities to name a few. LNG terminal operators are placing more emphasis on higher energy efficiency and minimal environmental footprint. This paper examines the applicability and suitability of different types of LNG regasification technologies that are currently available and new regasification designs proposed for future terminals. The paper is divided into two parts. Part 1 covers the LNG regasification technologies used in conventional onshore receiving terminal while Part 2 covers the LNG regasification technologies used in offshore receiving terminal.

TI  - Cost assessments of ship main propulsion and service power options
AB  - With the increase of greenhouse-gas regulation in marine vessels, more attention has been paid to the energy saving and carbon reduction problems. Main propulsion and service power systems that cause emissions and result in significant fuel oil costs are among the major energy saving and carbon reduction problems. Better fuel efficiency and cleaner emissions alternatives for main propulsion and ship service power, that provide different improvement levels, can be used to match individual owner's special needs. Cost effective analysis is essential and important when considering the economic competitiveness of these alternatives. In order to provide accurate cost analysis results, a set of cost analysis model for ship main propulsion and service generator systems is proposed in this paper. A present value method is used to consider capital cost and operational & maintenance costs in the economic life of equipment in the analysis. Several possible propulsion and electrical power generation options are studied by using ship practical data. To reduce effects of uncertain parameters on analysis result and determine critical parameters, sensitive analyses are also performed. The model developed can assist owners in establishing a business case for currently available or further ship powering and electrical generator systems.

TI  - Carbon sequestration: Key features and issues
AB  - In order to reduce CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, the geological storage by capturing from major stationary sources and injecting it into suitable deep rock formations provides a powerful way. The technologies concerning the sequestration of CO2 are relatively mature, even if some problems - related to environment, health, security, legal aspects and public acceptance â€“ are still open. The sequestration, confinement and trapping of acid gas, share a large set of materials, both natural and engineered, and complex phenomena. For performance and safety purposes, the persistence of initial sealing function as to be ensured over time, as the cap rock (usually clay materials) and foreigner anthropogenic materials will undergo physicochemical interactions and may lead to irreversible transformations. The storage behaviour is an issue to be evaluated versus time ahead (100 - 1000 years), and the long-term reliability of confinement has to be anticipated with sufficient accuracy.

TI  - Ocean Acidification as a Risk to Food Derived From the Marine Ecosystem: In Search of International Legal Responses
AB  - Acting as carbon sinks along with forests, the oceans absorb approximately 30% of global CO2 emissions. However, said function has consequences, as the oceans are becoming more acidic due to a chemical interaction between water molecules (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which produces carbonic acid (H2CO3). Said carbonic acid reduces the amount of carbonate ions in the water, which, in turn, leads to a series of negative knock-on effects on many marine organisms and thus on the living resources of the ocean from which we obtain food. At present, there is no international legal instrument that specifically addresses ocean acidification or its effects on the marine environment. Given that acidification is currently having negative effects on global food security, as will be described throughout this paper, it is convenient and useful to locate, in the framework of international legal instruments, those norms that contribute to mitigating said phenomenon. Precisely, this work focuses on studying, at a universal level, those legal instruments that can be used in the fight against ocean acidification. We therefore exclude the analysis of regional regulations or the study of soft law instruments. Given the fact that the protection of food security derived from marine living resources is threatened by this phenomenon, the identification of norms and obligations to reduce and mitigate ocean acidification is hence justified as part of the present book on food security.

TI  - More smaller sources in marine seismic acquisition
AB  - Fontana and Zickerman (2010) pose a very relevant question â€œwhat level of sound is actually required to meet the geophysical objective of a particular survey?â€. They suggest that â€œbigger is always betterâ€ to achieve the best seismic image possible is an outdated philosophy. This suggestion is supported by the recent rapid uptake for more smaller sources to optimize spatial sampling and/or reduce survey duration. Two field tests comparing three to two sub-array sources have been published, one offshore Norway (Langhammer and Bennion 2015) and another offshore Brazil (Rocke et al 2018). In this paper two further field studies, this time evaluating single sub-array sources, will be outlined. Â© 2021 EAGE.

AB  - This study was based on the remote sensing images of the south bank of Hangzhou Bay. We used ENVI and ArcGIS for spatial correction and processing of these images and obtained the coastal wetland datasets. InVEST model was performed to analyze the change of blue carbon of intertidal wetland and its evaluation during the past 15 years on the south bank of Hangzhou Bay. The results showed that (1) From 2003 to 2017, there were escalating trends for total carbon storage and maximum carbon storage per unit area, the total carbon storage increased from 22 million tons to 76 million tons, and the net carbon storage increased by 54.3 million tons. The maximum carbon storage per unit area increased from 451.27t/hm2 to 1775.42t/hm2. As a whole, the potential of wetland carbon sink was increased on the south bank of Hangzhou Bay. (2) From 2003 to 2017, there was no carbon lass, and the overall performance was carbon accumulation on the south bank of Hangzhou Bay. The total amount of blue carbon was 54 million tons, and the maximum net carbon fixation per unit area was 1324.12t/hm2. (3) From 2003 to 2017, the total value of blue carbon was 476.13 billion yuan on the south bank of Hangzhou Bay, and the maximum value of blue carbon per unit area was 1.488 million yuan, which was a considerable ecological value. (4) As the storage of blue carbon in the intertidal is closely related to the vegetation type, Phragmites australis plays the most prominent role in improving the carbon sequestration capacity because itâ€™s the dominant species on the south bank of Hangzhou Bay. (5) Under the preset scenario of returning aquaculture ponds to wetlands, it is predicted that the carbon sequestration and blue carbon value will significantly increase on the south bank of Hangzhou Bay by 2030.

TI  - Deepwater drilling challenges demonstrate learning curve with new connection technology
AB  - Located in the ultra-deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), Chevron's Saint Malo (St. Malo), Lewis, Turtle Lake, and Northwood wells represent drilling projects that demand careful planning, precise execution, and advanced technology. Challenging the current offshore drilling depths, these wells are completed up to, and sometimes exceeding 33,000 ft, and the execution of these projects have benefited from a new 3rd Generation Double-Shoulder Connection (3rd Gen. DSC). A key objective for the development of the 3rd Gen. DSC was to improve connection make-up / break-out speeds relative to Second Generation Double-Shoulder Connection (2nd Gen. DSC). The new connection incorporates a double-start thread that reduces the number of revolutions to assemble and disassemble the connection by half. Physical laboratory comparison testing shows an approximate 11 second time savings in stab to shoulder for 57/8-in. 3rd Gen DSC compared to 2nd Gen DSC. Also, the 3rd Gen. DSC provides increased mechanical performance, larger inside diameters, and enhanced fatigue performance. The first 3rd Gen. DSC drillstring used by Chevron was 57/8-in. 26.30 lb/ft S-135 in the St. Malo well. The rig crew experienced an adjustment period during make-up of approximately the first 10 connections. Make-up speed of the new connection was realized, and analysis of well data demonstrated improved efficiency and cost savings. Chevron's second use on the Lewis well resulted in similar time savings; however, neither well realized the full approximate 11 sec time savings observed in laboratory testing. One possible explanation for the make-up variance is that the rig crew took special care to run the pipe slowly to minimize damage observed with prior generation connections. In response to the field performance feedback of these first two wells, a program was initiated to monitor and improve the value of the connection on future wells. The manufacturer's personnel were dispatched to the field to evaluate make-up procedures and rig equipment, and the subsequent implementation of improved maintenance procedures and equipment modifications improved running times. A key benefit observed throughout the project was reduced connection damage, and Chevron realized over 80 percent reduction in repair rates and costs compared to similar wells using 2nd Gen. DSC. This paper describes the planning, well design, drilling challenges, and lessons learned on the four Chevron deepwater projects utilizing 3rd Gen. DSC. It provides comparison data between four similar projects that used 2 nd Gen. DSC with the four projects drilled with the 3rd Gen. DSC, and comparisons include running and tripping speed analysis and repair cost considerations related to connection handling damage. The paper summarizes drilling efficiency results achieved on the four projects and it provides recommendations to maximize the effectiveness of the new connection technology on future projects.

TI  - Life cycle assessment of integrated seawater agriculture in the Arabian (Persian) Gulf as a potential food and aviation biofuel resource
AB  - Purpose: Prospective evaluation of the lifecycle impacts of aviation biofuel production in Abu Dhabi, UAE based on a production system that integrates aquaculture, saltwater agriculture, and mangrove silviculture, termed an Integrated Seawater Energy Agriculture System (ISEAS) in order to investigate its energetic and environmental potential compared to conventional fuels. Methods: We compare the hydroprocessed renewable jet fuel (HRJ) produced from ISEAS against fossil jet fuel using a life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Based on a detailed description of the production process, we use data from a wide-ranging literature review and experimental results from the specific location to make informed assumptions for the range of the process inputs and yields. We then analyze several process configuration scenarios with different ranges. Results and discussion: ISEAS can produce aviation biofuels, electricity, and food while afforesting coastal desert land, acting as a long-term sink for carbon, minimizing freshwater consumption, and having beneficial land use impacts when compared to fossil jet fuel production. Based on a sensitivity analysis, we show that ISEAS HRJ emits 38 to 68% less greenhouse gases than fossil jet fuel and yields an overall positive net energy balance under all scenarios except one with an extensive use of desalinated water. Conclusions: ISEAS offers a promising pathway for integrating aquaculture and seawater agriculture in arid regions. It is essentially a process to sustainably augment aquaculture-based products by using its waste as a biofuel resource. Achieving positive emissions results depend critically on minimizing freshwater use, maximizing biomass yield and to a lesser extent the performance of biomass gasification.

TI  - Interactive well test technology for offshore exploration wells [æµ·ä¸ŠæŽ¢äº•æµ‹è¯•äº¤äº’å¼è¯•äº•æŠ€æœ¯]
AB  - During the process of storage type well testing, the working state of the pressure gauge in borehole cannot be recognized, and the applicability of data stored to geological interpretation cannot be diagnosed, but these aspects can only be confirmed by data playback when the testing string is tripped out. This process affects the test cost, progress and efficiency. The interactive downhole wireless transmission well test system connects the downhole signal transmitter directly with the testing valve and it is run in hole with the testing string. The direct-reading tool string with the receiver is landed via cable to the fixed position in hole. The data acquired by the pressure gauge below the valve is sent wirelessly through the transmitter to the receiver which then transits the data to the surface through the cable. In this way, the data recorded by the pressure gauge downhole under the condition of shut-in can be read on surface. Since 2013, the interactive well test system has been applied in 31 layers of offshore exploration wells. While real-time pressure monitoring under the condition of shut-in, the system has facilitated the timeliness of data acquisition and reservoir interpretation and evaluation, and helped reduce the operating expenses up to RMB 46.898 million cumulatively. This technology is of great significance to deciding the test system for offshore exploration wells and reducing the test cost. Â© 2019, The Editorial Department of Well Testing. All right reserved.

At Glasgow, Dr Kamenos will study how ocean acidification will affect maerl, a very slow-growing marine plant that can live for thousands of years and, like corals, provides a habitat for many other marine species. Work has already begun to set up a new aquaria to keep maerl and corals alive at Glasgow University and Heriot-Watt Universities. The research will take three years and will involve intense periods of fieldwork on maerl beds and cold-water coral reefs.

TI  - Attenuation capacity of a coastal aquifer under managed recharge by reclaimed wastewater
AB  - Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is becoming an increasingly attractive water management option, especially in semi-arid areas. Nevertheless, field studies on the fate and transport of priority substances, heavy metals and pharmaceutical products within the recharged aquifer are rare. Based on the above, the objective of this project is to study the hydrological conditions of the coastal aquifer of Ezousa (Cyprus) and its ability to attenuate pollutants. The Ezousa riverbed is a locally important aquifer used for a MAR project where treated effluent from the Paphos Waste Water Treatment Plant is recharged into the aquifer through a number of artificial ponds along the riverbed. Additionally, groundwater is pumped for irrigation purposes from wells located nearby. The hydrological conditions of the area are unique due to the construction of the Kannaviou dam in 2005 that reduced natural recharge of the Ezousa aquifer significantly, inducing the saltwater intrusion phenomenon. A three-dimensional finite element model of the area was constructed using the FEFLOW software to simulate the groundwater flow conditions and transport of Phosphorous and cooper in the subsurface from the recharge process. The model was calibrated using hydraulic head and chemical data for the time period of 2002-2011. The groundwater model was coupled with a geochemical model PHREEQC attempting to evaluate nitrate and Copper processes. Inverse modeling calculation was used to determine sets of moles transfers of phases that are attributed to the water composition change in groundwater between the mixture of natural groundwater and reclaimed wastewater and the final water composition.

TI  - LNG COLD ENERGY POTENTIAL FOR CONTAINER SHIP AND FERRY
AB  - WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤â€™s patented cold energy recovery system has demonstrated operational savings on the LNG-fuelled ferry Viking Grace by reducing the amount of electricity consumed in HVAC system cooling compressors. To further improve, a new study from Denmark looks beyond that to the potential of LNG cold energy for vessels with dual-fuel engines. Main engine exhaust gases, jacket cooling water, seawater and an intermediate glycol-water system for HVAC cooling were considered as heat sources for the ORC unit. The maximum power output was obtained using butane as the working fluid for the seawater and glycolwater configurations, iso-pentane for jacket water and n-pentane for engine exhaust gases. The savings attainable when using the LNG cold energy to further cool engine scavenge air (to increase engine efficiency and reduce NOx emissions) were highly dependent on relative air humidity. High humidity meant that up to 39% of the heat was used to condense the water vapor rather than to cool the air in tropical conditions. The estimated fuel savings under ISO conditions (ambient temperature of 25Â°C and relative humidity of 30%) ranged from 0.41% to 0.44%. The system combines thermal energy storage with a waste heat recovery system based on ORC technology, and it was evaluated for a hypothetical ferry requiring 1MW of auxiliary power. The results suggest that the proposed system could reduce CO2 emissions by 8% and could be economically competitive with the installation of battery systems to supply power during port stays, especially for newbuilds.

TI  - AASTA Hansteen hull-topsides dry transport and dual barge mating operations
AB  - The Aasta Hansteen Field development in 1300m water depth is the deepest field on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) and is developed using a Truss Spar FPSO. The platform was made ready with platform mooring chains after which Topsides were installed by float-over method in a fjord before the complete platform was being towed to the field vertically in summer of 2018. The Topsides of 25,300 t and the hull of 46,000 t were both constructed by Hyundai Heavy Industries in Korea and transported to Norway on Boskalis heavy transport vessels. Due to its size and weight, the Truss Spar FPSO had to be transported by the largest heavy transport vessel in the world, BOKA Vanguard. Topsides mating onto the Spar hull was carried out by Boskalis in a Norwegian fjord by a dual barge float-over operation. The Topsides was first transferred from HTV White Marlin to two S-class vessels, then from the two S-Class vessels to the Spar hull. Load transfer was obtained by simultaneous ballasting of the dual barge hulls and de-ballasting of the Spar hull. The paper will focus on the engineering and design process of the dual barge float-over operation and the subsequent translation to a real time simulation model followed by the actual dual barge float-over and mating operation. The information and discussion provided in the paper can be used for planning and design of other large floater applications. There were several firsts in the execution of this scope ranging from transporting the world's largest Spar platform on the world's largest heavy transport vessel to executing a dual barge float-over and mating operation using two heavy transport vessels. The use of real time simulation as validation and training tool has been a highlight of this scope. Copyright Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Fuel cell demonstration at the U.S. coast guard air station cape cod

Beginning in 1998, the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) and the U.S. Army Corps of engineers' Construction engineering Research Laboratory (CERL) provided technical assistance in the form of project economics, analysis, and site selection. The 250-kW fuel cell combined heat and power plant is located at the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod in Bourne, Massachusetts. The prime contractor, PPL Corporation, was responsible for all engineering and design work. FuelCell Energy of Danbury, Connecticut, was responsible for the manufacture, delivery, and installation of the fuel cell. Fuel cells produce electricity through an electrochemical reaction rather than combustion. While currently more expensive to purchase than conventional power-generating equipment, fuel cells provide efficient, reliable power with minimal emissions.

TI  - Symposium review: Effective nutritional strategies to mitigate enteric methane in dairy cattle
AB  - Intensive research in the past decade has resulted in a better understanding of factors driving enteric methane (CH4) emissions in ruminants. Meta-analyses of large databases, developed through the GLOBAL NETWORK project, have identified successful strategies for mitigation of CH4 emissions. Methane inhibitors, alternative electron sinks, vegetable oils and oilseeds, and tanniferous forages are among the recommended strategies for mitigating CH4 emissions from dairy and beef cattle and small ruminants. These strategies were also effective in decreasing CH4 emissions yield and intensity. However, a higher inclusion rate of oils may negatively affect feed intake, rumen function, and animal performance, specifically milk components in dairy cows. In the case of nitrates (electron sinks), concerns with animal health may be impeding their adoption in practice, and potential emission trade-offs have to be considered. Tannins and tanniferous forages may have a negative effect on nutrient digestibility, and more research is needed to confirm their effects on overall animal performance in long-term experiments with high-producing animals. A meta-analysis of studies with dairy cows fed the CH4 inhibitor 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) at the Pennsylvania State University showed (1) a consistent 28 to 32\% decrease in daily CH4 emissions or emissions yield and intensity; (2) no effect on dry matter intake, milk production, body weight, or body weight change, and a slight increase in milk fat concentration and yield (0.19 percentage units and 90 g/d, respectively); 3-NOP also appears to increase milk urea nitrogen concentration; (3) an exponential decrease in the mitigation effect of the inhibitor with increasing its dose (from 40 to 200 mg/kg of feed dry matter, corresponding to 3-NOP intake of 1 to 4.8 g/ cow per day); and (4) a potential decrease in the efficacy of 3-NOP over time, which needs to be further investigated in long-term, full-lactation or multiple-lactation studies. The red macroalga Asparagopsis taxiformis has a strong CH4 mitigation effect, but studies are needed to determine its feasibility, long-term efficacy, and effects on animal production and health. We concluded that widespread adoption of mitigation strategies with proven effectiveness by the livestock industries will depend on cost, government policies and incentives, and willingness of consumers to pay a higher price for animal products with decreased carbon footprint.

TI  - The effect of submarine CO2 vents on seawater: Implications for detection of subsea carbon sequestration leakage
AB  - The effect of submarine carbon dioxide (CO2) vents on seawater carbonate chemistry have been determined using hydrographical and marine carbonate data obtained from two submarine hydrothermal vent fields, as well as a reference station, all near the Jan Mayen Island in the Norwegian-Greenland Sea. We have shown that one can successfully determine the excess carbon that enters the seawater from the vents by applying a modified version of a back-calculation technique, which is traditionally used to study the invasion of excess atmospheric CO2 in the surface ocean. As a result of this excess carbon, total dissolved inorganic carbon (C-T) in the seawater surrounding the vents was on average 12 mol kg(-1) (1-30 mol kg(-1)) higher compared to samples obtained from a reference station outside the venting areas. The observed excess C-T was most significant between 100 m and 200 m but was noticeable in all depths with the exception of the upper 10-20 m. The absence of a venting CO2 signal in the surface water and the realism of the results are discussed. We believe the present method is promising for monitoring (detection and quantification) of CO2 leakage into the water column due to its high sensitivity and readiness for automation.

TI  - Potential of the middle cambrian aquifer for carbon dioxide storage in the baltic states
AB  - The importance of CO2 removal from the atmosphere has long been an essential topic due to climate change. In this paper, the authors aim to demonstrate the suitability of the underground reservoirs for CO2 storage based on their geological characteristics. The research addressed the potential of geological formations for fossil CO2 storage in the Baltic States to support the goal of achieving carbon neutrality in the region. The geological, technical, and economic feasibility for CO2 storage has been assessed in terms of carbon sequestration in geological structures and the legal framework for safe geological storage of fossil CO2. Results indicate that prospective structural traps in the Baltic States, with reasonable capacity for CO2 storage, occur only in Southwestern Latvia (onshore) and in the Baltic Sea (offshore), whilst other regions in the Baltics either do not meet basic geological requirements, or have no economically feasible capacity for CO2 storage. Based on the examination of geological characteristics, the most fitting is the middle Cambrian reservoir in the Baltic sedimentary basin, and one of the most prospective structural traps is the geological structure of Dobele, with an estimated storage capacity of 150 Mt CO2. This study revealed that the storage capacity of the middle Cambrian reservoir (up to 1000 Mt CO2) within the borders of Southwestern Latvia is sufficient for carbon capture and safe storage for the whole Baltic region, and that geological structures in Latvia have the capacity to store all fossil CO2 emissions produced by stationary sources in the Baltic States for several decades.

TI  - A logistic model for assessment of wind power combined with electrolytic hydrogen production in weak grids
AB  - In this paper, electrolytic hydrogen (H2) production is proposed as a control method for wind power in weak grids, allowing for a high penetration of wind power without violating network constraints. A logistical simulation model for performance evaluation of such wind-H2 systems has been described in the paper. The simulation model utilizes results from power flow calculations, in order to take into account thermal limits and restrictions on slow voltage variations in the network. The model has been tested on an example study of a Norwegian island where H2 is proposed to be used as a fuel for a local ferry. The analysis showed that both voltage constraints and thermal limits of the power lines influence the ability of using electrolysis for load management. With the chosen component sizing and control strategy, the required H2 storage capacity was equivalent to 19 days of H2 consumption in the ferry, while about 80% of the H2 was produced from wind power. The results obtained here indicate that there are large benefits of using the grid as backup for H2 production in periods with low wind speed, regarding the H2 storage sizing and the electrolyzer operating conditions.

TI  - Exploring possible energy futures for the UK: Evolving power generation
AB  - In response to the predictions of climate change models the EU has imposed very strong reductions in carbon emissions for the member nations. As a result the UK is signed up to reduce carbon emissions to 20% of their 1990 value by 2050. This will require a complete change in power generation over the next 40 years. But the system involved is clearly immensely complex, with multiple agents, levels of description, new technologies and new policies and actions. As part of the CASCADE research programme we propose to split the problem into two parts: a long term overarching model about the evolution of the generating capacity available, and a short term, detailed model of the wholesale and retail energy markets that links supply and demand. We describe the first of these, a relatively simple spatial, dynamic model that represents possible spatial patterns of electrical generation capacity from 2010 until 2050 aimed at tripling production and reducing CO2 emissions by 80%. Investment will be made into new low carbon generating capacity: wind farms, nuclear plants, bio-fuels, waste conversion and pyrolysis, tidal and wave marine plants and possibly clean coal or gas plants where the CO2 is sequestered. It allows the exploration of possible pathways to 2050, in which different choices and spatial patterns of investment are run. It provides an annual input scenario for a much more detailed, short time scale, agent based model of the UK wholesale and retail energy markets (Rylatt et al., 2013). Of course, over time the two models will provide feedback that will change the models and their parameters, as new technologies, costs and opportunities emerge.

TI  - Upwelling-induced trace gas dynamics in the Baltic Sea inferred from 8 years of autonomous measurements on a ship of opportunity
AB  - Autonomous measurements aboard ships of opportunity (SOOP) provide in situ data sets with high spatial and temporal coverage. In this study, we use 8 years of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) observations from SOOP Finnmaid to study the influence of upwelling on trace gas dynamics in the Baltic Sea. Between spring and autumn, coastal upwelling transports water masses enriched with CO2 and CH4 to the surface of the Baltic Sea. We study the seasonality, regional distribution, relaxation, and interannual variability in this process. We use reanalysed wind and modelled sea surface temperature (SST) data in a newly established statistical upwelling detection method to identify major upwelling areas and time periods. Large upwelling-induced SST decrease and trace gas concentration increase are most frequently detected around August after a long period of thermal stratification, i.e. limited exchange between surface and underlying waters. We found that these upwelling events with large SST excursions shape local trace gas dynamics and often lead to near-linear relationships between increasing trace gas levels and decreasing temperature. Upwelling relaxation is mainly driven by mixing, modulated by air-sea gas exchange, and possibly primary production. Subsequent warming through air-sea heat exchange has the potential to enhance trace gas saturation. In 2015, quasi-continuous upwelling over several months led to weak summer stratification, which directly impacted the observed trace gas and SST dynamics in several upwelling-prone areas. Trend analysis is still prevented by the observed high variability, uncertainties from data coverage, and long water residence times of 10-30 years. We introduce an extrapolation method based on trace gas-SST relationships that allows us to estimate upwelling-induced trace gas fluxes in upwelling-affected regions. In general, the surface water reverses from CO2 sink to source, and CH4 outgassing is intensified as a consequence of upwelling. We conclude that SOOP data, especially when combined with other data sets, enable flux quantification and process studies addressing the process of upwelling on large spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - Study of macro algae for marine biotechnology material from large scale offshore cultivation from multiple mooring system of large aquaculture ocean floating structure
AB  - Macro-algae farming have become one of the natural resources which are economically important. Macro alage are used as food in many Asian countries, and extracts for use as food additives (gelling agent, preservative etc.) and in other industries (textiles, pharmaceuticals, biomass energy etc.). The existing cultivation systems for macro-algae are not environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. Lack of suitable platform for large scale cultivation and potential coastline disturbance necessitates the need to develop novel deployment technology for deep and opens water cultivation. Macro-algae are useful biomaterial for food, food supplement, gels, solar cell, clean animal feeds, biomass energy, pharmaceutical, fracking product. To avoid mooring system failure, selecting an appropriate breaking strength and limit state for mooring lines is necessary, this paper describe multiple interacting mooring system design that account for forces and environmental loadings on the system. The paper describe evaluation of optimum mooring performance in wave, wind induced current loadings on mooring components, analysis of anchor, buoy, riser elements and compensator sinker that are involved in the multiple mooring system dynamics are presented. The paper also discuss establishment of appropriate safety factors and coefficient for the design of very large offshore aquaculture floating structure.

TI  - Surface mooring network in the Kuroshio extension
AB  - As a contribution to the Global Earth Observation System of Systems, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is developing surface moorings that carry a suite of field-proven and cost-effective sensors to monitor air-sea heat, moisture, and momentum fluxes, carbon dioxide uptake, and upper ocean temperature, salinity, and currents. In June 2004, an NOAA surface mooring, referred to as the Kuroshio Extension Observatory (KEO), was deployed in the Kuroshio Extension's (KE) southern recirculation gyre, approximately 300 nautical miles east of Japan. In 2006, a partnership between NOAA and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology was formed that deployed a second mooring (referred to as JKEO) north of the KE jet in February 2007. KE is a region of strong currents, typhoons, and winter storms. Designing and maintaining moorings in the KE is a challenging engineering task. All data are publicly available. A subset of the data are telemetered and made available in near real time through the Global Telecommunications System and web-based data distribution systems. Data from these time-series reference sites serve a wide research and operational community and are being used for assessing numerical weather prediction analyses and reanalyses and for quantifying the air-sea interaction in this dynamic region.

TI  - Air-ice carbon pathways inferred from a sea ice tank experiment
AB  - Given rapid sea ice changes in the Arctic Ocean in the context of climate warming, better constraints on the role of sea ice in CO2 cycling are needed to assess the capacity of polar oceans to buffer the rise of atmospheric CO2 concentration. Air-ice CO2 fluxes were measured continuously using automated chambers from the initial freezing of a sea ice cover until its decay during the INTERICE V experiment at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin. Cooling seawater prior to sea ice formation acted as a sink for atmospheric CO2, but as soon as the first ice crystals started to form, sea ice turned to a source of CO2, which lasted throughout the whole ice growth phase. Once ice decay was initiated by warming the atmosphere, the sea ice shifted back again to a sink of CO2. Direct measurements of outward ice-atmosphere CO2 fluxes were consistent with the depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon in the upper half of sea ice. Combining measured air-ice CO2 fluxes with the partial pressure of CO2 in sea ice, we determined strongly different gas transfer coefficients of CO2 at the air-ice interface between the growth and the decay phases (from 2.5 to 0.4 mol m(-2) d(-1) atm(-1)). A 1D sea ice carbon cycle model including gas physics and carbon biogeochemistry was used in various configurations in order to interpret the observations. All model simulations correctly predicted the sign of the air-ice flux. By contrast, the amplitude of the flux was much more variable between the different simulations. In none of the simulations was the dissolved gas pathway strong enough to explain the large fluxes during ice growth. This pathway weakness is due to an intrinsic limitation of ice-air fluxes of dissolved CO2 by the slow transport of dissolved inorganic carbon in the ice. The best means we found to explain the high air-ice carbon fluxes during ice growth is an intense yet uncertain gas bubble efflux, requiring sufficient bubble nucleation and upwards rise. We therefore call for further investigation of gas bubble nucleation and transport in sea ice.

TI  - A comparison of soil carbon pools across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the southern African warm-temperate range limit
AB  - Mangroves and salt marshes are globally recognized for their ability to efficiently sequester and store carbon in biomass and soil carbon pools. An increase in soil carbon has been found at range limits where mangroves are expanding along ecotones into salt marsh, as mangroves store more carbon per unit area. However, the magnitude of this trend is variable at different mangrove range limits depending on the rates of expansion and the local climatic and geomorphological factors that influence current mangrove distribution. This study presents the first account of soil carbon storage across a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone at the Nahoon Estuary, a warm-temperate range limit for the east coast of the African continent. Soil carbon (to 50 cm depth) was compared between mangrove, salt marsh, and a transitional ecotone habitat. We found that soil carbon was highest at 30-50 cm below the surface across all habitats. The average soil carbon in the upper 50 cm was similar in mangrove (110.14 MgC.ha(-1)), ecotone (114.50 MgC.ha(-1)), and salt marsh habitats (109.62 MgC. ha(-1)). These results show that although mangroves have expanded at the Nahoon Estuary over the past 50 years, the soil carbon content is still similar across the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. This is in contrast to other studies from southern hemisphere mangrove range limits in Australia. However, these trends have been reported at northern hemisphere range limits in the USA. Further studies in this region are needed to identify environmental factors influencing soil carbon variability. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Offshore air pollution and technological fixes: A Norway - UK comparison of achievement
AB  - This study focuses upon the offshore sectors of the two important oil countries Norway and the United Kingdom (UK), and particularly whether and how policy instruments have provided incentives for the development, adoption and diffusion of environmentally benign technologies and hence reduction in emissions of the air pollutants NOx and VOCs. The assessment is that Norway is a bit more 'advanced' than the UK in terms of technological change in this issue area. In order to understand this difference, it is important to keep in mind that fundamental problem characteristics differ considerably between the two countries. For instance, in Norway, offshore emissions play an important role in the total emission picture. This is particularly the case for VOCs, where offshore emissions account for 60% of the total emissions. This is very different in the UK, where offshore NOx and VOCs emissions only account for around 4-5%. The upshot of this is that the sheer governmental need to develop and apply effective technology in order to attain domestic and international emissions reduction goals is clearly much greater in Norway than in the UK.

TI  - Voyage performance of ship fitted with Flettner rotor
AB  - In order to tackle global warming, the maritime sector is trying alternative power sources to reduce the carbon emissions from ships. Wind assist technologies are considered as renewable alterative power sources and ships designed with such technologies may provide the important step toward decarburization. Among many effective measures, Flettner rotor, as one of the wind assist technologies, is increasingly becoming a topic of interest within the shipping industry. However, the performance of a ship fitted with Flettner Rotor is very much dependent on the wind magnitude and direction, which are random by nature. This paper aims to make an in-depth discussion on the benefits from Flettner rotor in terms of energy efficiency. Firstly, a ship weather routing system is briefly introduced which is very helpful to assess the true performance of ships fitted with Flettner rotor. Next, many case studies are carried out based on a generic ship with and without rotors. Different combinations of several traditional routes including both outward and return directions, different departure time throughout the whole operation year and average slow, medium and fast ship speeds are taken into account as shipping conditions for comparison. Finally, the benefit obtained through Flettner rotor technology - in various shipping routes, departure times and ship speeds-is presented and a framework for assessing the performance of wind assist technology is proposed.

TI  - Towards low carbon global supply chains: A multi-trade analysis of CO2 emission reductions in container shipping
AB  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has agreed in 2018 on a reduction of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping, which should lower the total annual CO2 emissions by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008. Although extensive studies exist on the impact of international shipping at a global scale, few tools and empirical papers are available to assess the progress made so far in the shift towards carbon clean maritime supply chains. The paper identifies the key factors affecting CO2 emissions by container ships based on extant literature and business insights and measures how much has been already achieved in the past decade by offering multi-trade comparisons of the situations in 2007 and 2016. The paper concludes to a general decrease in annual CO2 emissions estimated at 33% since 2007. Two factors explain this decrease: first, the CO2 fuel efficiency in grams per TEU-km (âˆ’53%) due to the general decrease in speed and change in technology, and second, the decrease from changes in network design leading to less distance travelled (âˆ’21%). One factor counterbalances these positive effects, i.e. the increase in the total deployed fleet capacity, partly due to an increase in the number and average size of vessels (+81%). Finally, the paper discusses how these findings could be used by shippers and logistics service providers when designing cargo routing solutions in a supply chain setting based on their carbon efficiency.

TI  - Understanding unconventional gas reservoir damages
AB  - It is estimated that there are large reserves of unconventional gas located throughout the world, including coalbed methane, shale gas and tight gas sands. Due to their specific characteristics - particularly low permeability in the microdarcy range, microfractures and high capillary pressures - unconventional gas reservoirs are vulnerable to irreversible damage during exploitation. This paper focuses on studies of damage evaluation in unconventional gas reservoirs around the world. We aim to provide a set of guidelines to avoid, minimize and/or remediate this damage. In Brazil, the Petrobras Strategic Plan for 2020 predicts 200% growth in gas production until 2020, as compared to 2010 gas production. Expected growth in international gas production will be 30% until 2020, as compared to 2010 world gas production. The main natural gas production projects of Petrobras between 2010 and 2014 are MexilhÃ£o, UruguÃ¡ and TambaÃº Cidade de Santos, totaling 35,000 BOE per day. Demand for natural gas is expected to increase from 46 million m3/day (2009) to 130 million m3/day until 2014, envisaging use in electrical power, industrial, fertilizer and other applications. The fundamental processes causing formation damage include but are not limited to physicochemical, chemical, hydrodynamic, mechanical, thermal and biological. Formation damage is not necessarily reversible, and therefore it should be avoided. Laboratory tests are designed to determine, understand and quantify the governing processes, their dependency on the in-situ and operational conditions, and their effect on formation damage. It should be emphasized that on one hand, high capillary pressure favors the spontaneous imbibition phenomenon and, consequently, mainly water-blocking damage. On the other hand this same effect has been investigated by several researchers to change the reservoir wettability by optimizing rock-fluid interactions using specific surfactant-brine systems during exploitation. It has been concluded that, beyond formation evaluation, phenomenological observations and the optimization of rock-fluid interactions are likely to promote gas production from minimally damaged unconventional reservoirs.

TI  - Hybrid energy systems for off-grid remote telecom tower in Odisha, India
AB  - Hybrid energy systems are increasingly being applied in areas where grid extension is considered uneconomical. Their costs can be minimised through proper equipment sizing and load matching. This paper reports the results of optimisation of solarâ€“wind hybrid energy system for remote telecom site which is located at the coastal island (20.33Â°N latitude and 86.73Â°E longitude) in Kendrapara district of Odisha, India. The present power supply system has been optimised using HOMER (Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables) software (2.68 version) package developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Colorado, USA. From the load demand and different equipment sizing, the net present cost, costs of energy and operating costs were determined and compared with only diesel generator system.

TI  - GIS database applications to evaluation of marine geohazards: New Los Angeles County Ocean outfall project
AB  - Marine infrastructure projects are becoming larger and more complex as technology improves. Existing and proposed structures are often located in areas subject to marine geohazards that may include active faulting, submarine landslides, shallow gas, turbidity currents, and complex subsurface stratigraphy. Large amounts of data must be acquired, stored, analyzed, interpreted, and presented to evaluate these geohazards during all stages of project work from feasibility to construction. Utilizing a GIS database is the most efficient way to complete these tasks. The Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County (LACSD) are evaluating the feasibility of a new tunnel and ocean outfall offshore the Port of Los Angeles, California. This project serves as a case study on the essential role of the GIS database in storing and analyzing various types of data, allowing integrated marine geohazard evaluation of potential tunnel alignments and diffuser locations. A GIS database containing data from previous work in the area served as the starting point for the project GIS database as the feasibility phase began in 2006. Geological, geophysical, and geotechnical data were added to the project GIS database during this feasibility phase. The project area lies in a region characterized by complex geology due to interaction between the Pacific and North American Tectonic Plates. Seismicity and geologic structure, as well as fault data for the Palos Verdes and Cabrillo faults which traverse the project area were incorporated into the GIS database. Geophysical data in the project GIS database included multibeam bathymetry and seismic reflection data with interpreted geologic contacts. Geotechnical GIS data consisted of logs from borings, Cone Penetrometer Tests and vibracores performed in various portions of the project area. These data were integrated using GIS to evaluate marine geohazards in the project area. Geologic contacts interpreted in the seismic data were ground truthed with the geotechnical data, exported to GIS, gridded and contoured. Areas characterized by faulting, shallow gas, hard rock, possible gas vent craters, potentially unstable slopes, and sediments possibly prone to liquefaction were mapped by integrating the GIS data. This mapped information was provided to the LACSD to assist in tunnel alignment/diffuser evaluation, cost/risk analysis, preliminary diffuser and tunnel design, tunneling equipment selection, and assessing construction methods and risks. As the project moves toward design in later phases, new data will be obtained and added to the project GIS database. Therefore, this GIS database will continue its role as an essential tool in helping to determine the final tunnel alignment and diffuser locations for this critical infrastructure project.

TI  - Thermal aging effect on the tensile and fatigue properties of the narrow-gap TIG welded joints in offshore floating nuclear power plants
AB  - In offshore floating nuclear power plants, the narrow-gap tungsten-inert gas (TIG) welding method is commonly applied to connect various geometries of pipes due to its high efficiency welding under the low heat input of the welding process. However, the narrow-gap TIG welds have a duplex structure and are sensitive to thermal aging mechanism. In this paper, the narrow-gap TIG joints were subjected to a series of accelerated thermal aging tests at 400 degrees C for 0, 2000, 5000, 13,000 and 30,000 h, respectively, to investigate the tensile and fatigue properties at different locations. The test results indicated that the yield strength and the ultimate tensile strength of the narrow-gap TIG welded joints increased with the increasing thermal aging time. Fatigue life increased along with the thermal aging duration. A modified life prediction model was proposed.

TI  - Plug and abandonment using reverse cement placement technique in deepwater gulf of Mexico
AB  - Four deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico were identified for permanent abandonment in accordance with local regulations. The abandonment plan called for multiple cement plugs to isolate the production zones from seabed in each well. The most challenging cement plugs in each well were the ones directly above the production packer isolating the casing-tubing annulus and the production tubing. To avoid cement left in the Christmas tree at seabed and potential plugging off any valves in the manifold, cement plugs could not be placed the direct way, pumping down the production tubing. An unconventional approach was proposed to address the challenge. It involved reverse placement of cement plugs, which is not common in deepwater even in these days. Using this technique, cement was pumped down the casing-production tubing annulus and, through perforations, back up the production tubing. Risk analysis indicated very low likelihood of plugging off any valves in the tree. However, this configuration did not allow use of mechanical separators between fluids to prevent intermixing. Additional challenges in placing the plug were the high deviation of the section and the completion brine in the wellbore. Simulation of reverse placement is not possible with existing software. Therefore, the jobs were designed using experimental software, which enabled the design engineer to accurately reconstruct field conditions. Additional attention was given to the job procedure to minimize contamination with the brine and optimize cement placement. Viscous spacer was pumped ahead and behind the slurry to displace the brine. The slurry was designed with low fluid loss to be squeezed through perforations in the production tubing without plugging them off. A total of seven plugs were placed using the reverse placement technique. Specific requirements with regards to the top of cement and plug integrity had to be met before any of the cement plugs could be accepted by the operator. All plugs were tagged and pressure tested successfully in the annulus as well as inside the production tubing on the first attempt. As a result of the campaign, the four wells were abandoned as per schedule and within budget. Copyright 2014, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Chain failure by bending on deepwater mooring systems
AB  - The premature rupture of mooring chains of the Girassol buoy after only a half-year of service was caused by bending fatigue of the first free chain link inside the chain hawse (fairlead). Although the mooring system had been designed according to offshore industry standards, it failed because of this bending-fatigue mode. A study of this bending phenomenon led to a redesign of both the top chain segment size and the hawse connection, which now includes a new chain-connecting arm (CCA). A new method was developed to estimate the fatigue damage in the chain subjected to bending, which was used to design a new CCA for the Girassol buoy. Copyright 2005 Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Life cycle flaring emissions mitigation potential of a novel Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid microreactor technology for synthetic crude oil production
AB  - This paper compares the environmental impacts of the operation of a novel Gas-to-Liquid (GtL) process for synthetic crude oil production with conventional crude oil production. This process uses novel microreactor technology (NetMIX) applied in Steam Methane Reforming and Fischer-Tropsch (FT-SMR) for the conversion of associated gas originated on offshore Oil and Gas exploration. Data from literature for Oil and Gas extraction together with data obtained from Aspen Plus Â® simulations was used to build the life cycle inventory. An attributional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed to compare the FT-SMR pathway to conventional crude oil production, using 1 MJ LHV as the functional unit. An additional assessment was also conducted by reporting the impact to 1 barrel. This is done to assess the effect that the add-on technology may have on the impact of current crude production. Converting associated gas using the FT-SMR pathway produces a synthetic crude with negative net GWP impacts. This is because the amount of avoided emissions is larger than the emissions due to the operation of the pathway. The remaining impact categories increase since the FT-SMR has additional intermediary steps, with added fuel energy needs, and additional process emissions. Moreover, the amount of natural gas required to produce 1 MJ of synthetic crude oil (abbreviated in the text as syncrude) results in larger impacts in the extraction phase, than those associated with the extraction of 1 MJ of conventional crude. The obtained syncrude has a GWP impact of âˆ’0.34 [âˆ’0.62, âˆ’0.14] kg CO2 eq/MJ, in comparison to 0.012 [0.009, 0.017] kg CO2 eq/MJ of conventional crude. A reduction of 8% to the impacts per daily barrel of crude (70.3 kg CO2 eq/barrel and 64.6 kg CO2 eq/barrel before and after using the FT-SMR pathway) was observed for a reduction of 34% of the total flared gas mass.

TI  - Changing the energy profile of the GCC states: A review
AB  - The six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) States have an excellent geographical location as a point that link between East and West in addition to the vast wealth resulting from the extraction and export of oil and natural gas. Life has got up in the cities of the region that evolved dramatically. However, this progress accompanied with some drawbacks. The lavish increase in energy consumption caused an increasing in environmental pollution of the area, which became obvious fact affect the human, water, and marine animals. This study focused on a general review of what GCC countries environmentally suffer from, and the practical steps taken by these countries collectively and individually to get rid of those problems. The studies about the region countries have shown its trend towards the use of renewable energies to heal a large part of the environmental damage resulting from years of development and consumption of fossil energy sources. As it turns out from the study, the GCC countries are still lagging behind establishing renewable energies power stations except the UAE that carried out the initiative Masdar City and Oman initiatives in solar energy. All countries in the region are making plans for the future and build and produce renewable energies, which seemed its star rises, especially with the understanding and awareness of decision-makers in the region to its importance.

TI  - Impact of environmental hypercapnia on fertilization success rate and the early embryonic development of the clam Limecola balthica (Bivalvia, Tellinidae) from the southern Baltic Sea â€“ A potential CO2 leakage case study
AB  - Carbon capture and storage technology was developed as a tool to mitigate the increased emissions of carbon dioxide by capture, transportation, injection and storage of CO2 into subterranean reservoirs. There is, however, a risk of future CO2 leakage from sub-seabed storage sites to the sea-floor sediments and overlying water, causing a pH decrease. The aim of this study was to assess effects of CO2-induced seawater acidification on fertilization success and early embryonic development of the sediment-burrowing bivalve Limecola balthica L. from the Baltic Sea. Laboratory experiments using a CO2 enrichment system involved three different pH variants (pH 7.7 as control, pH 7.0 and pH 6.3, both representing environmental hypercapnia). The results showed significant fertilization success reduction under pH 7.0 and 6.3 and development delays at 4 and 9 h post gamete encounter. Several morphological aberrations (cell breakage, cytoplasm leakages, blastomere deformations) in the early embryos at different cleavage stages were observed. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - A novel approach to green, safe and economic subsea hydrotesting
AB  - The King West single well deepwater development is a 2.5 miles, 6â€ flowline tieback to the existing King system western flowline in water depth of 5,500 ft. The King West Project Team was faced with high costs and complex methods for hydrotesting and tying this into the King subsea system. The conventional BP GoM Projects subsea flowline hydrotest method is to pump seawater or fresh water, pressurize it, and test for any possible leaks. Upon completion, the water is discharged subsea or displaced using nitrogen. For deepwater flowlines, residual water from the hydrotest must be inhibited to prevent hydrate formation during initial well startup. However, the bathymetry of the King West flowline indicated that inhibition by methanol displacement alone could not achieve this and complex nitrogen de-watering would be needed. The Project Team suggested investigating the possibility of using natural hydrate inhibition properties of high salinity inhibited completion brine instead of fresh water for flowline hydrotesting. This novel approach has major benefits. It reduced environmental impact and personnel exposure, procedure complexity, risks in dewatering operations; process upsets and allows the hydrotest fluid to flow back with well fluids through the host facility process then safely discharged. Moreover, the well startup time was reduced by approximately two days. In order to fully understand the hydrate inhibition properties of calcium chloride (CaCl2) brine, several tests were conducted at local labs. These test results showed that using a CaCl2 brine with a concentration of 11.2 ppg (33.9 wt%) would be best for King West hydrotesting. Eight different hydrate prediction softwares were compared with experimental hydrate formation data for high salinity brine-hydrocarbon systems. Comparisons showed only one prediction software matches the experimental data within a close range. The other key finding observed from the experimental data is that CaCl2 depression of hydrate formation temperature does not reach a maximum at increased concentrations, instead the hydrate inhibition capability continue to increase with further increase in CaCl2 concentration. The pressurized crystallization point (PCT) for 11.2 ppg CaCl2 brine at 15,000 psi was measured as 15 oF, which is well below the seabed temperature for King West flowline. The King West subsea system was successfully hydrotested on May 29-30, 2003 by using 11.2 ppg CaCl2 brine inhibited with corrosion inhibitor and oxygen scavenger. Production was started with no associated facility upsets, hydrate formation or well downtime. Â© 2005, Offshore Technology Conference.

TI  - Offshore Aquaculture: I Know It When I See It
AB  - Offshore aquaculture is increasingly viewed as a mechanism to meet growing protein demand for seafood, while minimizing adverse consequences on the environment and other uses in the oceans. However, despite growing interest in offshore aquaculture, there appears to be no consensus as to what measures commonly define an offshore site or how effects of offshore aquaculture relative to more nearshore practices-are assessed. This lack of agreement on what constitutes offshore aquaculture has the potential to convolute communication, create uncertainty in regulatory processes, and impede understanding of the ecological implications of offshore farming. To begin addressing these issues, we reviewed and analyzed biologically-focused primary and gray literature (Ntotai = 70) that categorize and quantify characteristics of offshore aquaculture from around the world. We found that many ``offshore{''} descriptions are relatively close to shore (<3 nm) and significantly shallower (minimum depth <= 30 m) than may be assumed. We also uncovered an overall lack of consistent reporting of even the most common location-focused metrics (distance from shore, depth, current), a dearth of impact related studies (n = 17), and narrow scope of the studies themselves (i.e., 82\% nutrient pollution). Of the finite subset of articles that investigated negative ecological impacts of offshore aquaculture, we found the probability of any measurable impact from an offshore farm appears to significantly decrease with distance from the farm (probability of measurable response at 90 m +/- SE = 0.01 +/- 0.03). Such general, but informative points of reference could be more robustly quantified with better systematic and standardized reporting of physical farm characteristics and a broader scope of ecological investigation into the effects of marine aquaculture. With offshore aquaculture still in its infancy, consistent metrics are needed for a comparable framework to guide sustainable offshore aquaculture research and development globally.

AB  - In the process of drilling offshore gas hydrate formations, the invasion of drilling fluid into formations may lead to hydrate decomposition, which will result in borehole instability. In order to solve these issues, the decomposition law of methane hydrate under different decomposition modes was investigated. The Peng-Robinson equation was introduced to calculate the change of methane gas mole number, and the experimental method for evaluating the inhibition of hydrate decomposition by drilling fluid was optimized. The effects of the kinetic inhibitor DY-1 and modified lecithin on the decomposition characteristics of hydrate were experimentally analyzed using this method, and the water-based drilling fluid suitable for gas hydrate formations was further optimized. The best way to evaluate the inhibition of drilling fluid on hydrate decomposition was to inject cold solution without relieving the pressure. The DY-1 and modified lecithin retarded hydrate decomposition by adsorbing in hydrate surface to inhibit heat and mass transfer, so they could be used as hydrate decomposition inhibitors of drilling fluid. The optimized drilling fluid system had good low-temperature rheological properties and shale inhibition and lubricity and could inhibit the formation and the decomposition of hydrates, meeting the basic requirements of drilling fluid technology for offshore gas hydrate formations.

TI  - A dynamic control system model for global temperature change and sea level rise in response to CO2 emissions
AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources are frequently cited as the dominant cause of global warming. One adverse effect of global warming caused by these emissions is sea level rise, which poses a significant threat to the sustainable development of coastal regions around the world. In this study we use concepts from dynamic systems control theory to develop a systems model that may be used to predict global temperature change and sea level rise. The model uses the radiative forcing function as an external input to represent the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the dynamic system. The dynamic system is calibrated using historical data on global temperature and sea level. An independent emission scenario, which results in a 2 C increase of temperature by 2100, is used to validate the model. The numerical results show that the model proposed is effective in predicting future global temperature change and future sea level rise. We then apply the proposed model to the 6 CO2 emission scenarios generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The projections indicate that global temperature will increase between 1.6 and 5.0 degrees C by 2100 and that sea level will rise between 60.3 and 98.4 cm relative to the 1990 level. These results are consistent with projections made by the IPCC and with results of other recent studies that used semi-empirical approaches.

TI  - Solar Sea Power: Over a century of invention
AB  - Solar Sea Power is one of the unusual technologies in history, in that it did not progress in capability much since its first invention by Jacques d'Arsonval in 1881. It has been reinvented several times since then (at least 14 instances, probably more), which is not unusual by itself, as explained in the paper, however, the lack of progress in technological sophistication is unusual, unless the design is dominated by an established, older, paradigm. Some of these repeated inventions were need-based, such as Claude's, intended for French colonial Africa; few or none matched periods of increased interest in solar power. Even though individual inventors developed Solar Sea Power (SSP), governments were considered likely to advance the technology and apply it for the first 90 years or so of its existence. Recently, this task has been abandoned by deep-pocket governments and left to small, specialized companies such as Anderson's. Examples of the former are the plant design intended for a lake in northern Italy and the mega-plant with identical technology designed under the Energy Research and Development Agency (ERDA) sponsorship by TRW, a government contractor since sold to an aerospace firm. SSP plants do not produce much electricity, but since a portion of the output is used for operation, it is free to operate, and constantly renewable. It is even more reliable than wind power, in that the temperature differences in suitable water are always there, but wind, a product of many factors, is not blowing at all times.

TI  - Optimization of hydrogen-producing sustainable island microgrids
AB  - Hydrogen-based microgrids are receiving attention as critical pathways are being charted for the decarbonization of our thermal, transport, and power grids. In this article, clean, cost-effective, and reliable hybrid microgrid designs are developed to satisfy hydrogen and electricity loads in three energy-stressed islands of Eastern Canada, namely Pelee, Wolfe, and Saint Pierre. The design iterations incorporate elements of solar, wind, fuel cells, Hydrogen, and electricity storage. Real-time field irradiation, wind speed, ambient temperature, and load data over 8760 h have been used to drive the designs. Although the anticipated inflation rate in Newfoundland is higher than in Ontario, the lowest net present cost (NPC) of the hybrid solution is found in Saint Pierre Island. The hydrogen cost, in this case, is \$7.5/kgH(2) and \$15.8/kgH(2) lower than that of Pelee and Wolfe islands, respectively. The maximum H-2 tank capacity (>= 680 kgH(2)) on Pelee Island is 3000 h/yr and 1000 h/yr lower than optimal cases in Saint Pierre and Wolf Islands, respectively. LCOE is more sensitive to market changes in fuel cell costs than other components. The highest LCOE reduction (similar to 63\%) is observed when the optimal case in Pelee Island increases its lifetime. Analyzing the volatility in resource assessment indicates that predicting the energy cost over a short-term project is challenging. The salvage share in the long-term project is more than that of the short-term, indicating that the long-term project can be more cost-effective taken overall.

TI  - A review on damage identification and structural health monitoring for offshore platform
AB  - Structural health monitoring (SHM) based on vibration measurements in large/complex structures were shown to be promising by researchers. The authors believe that the SHM problem is fundamentally one of statistical pattern recognition. Therefore, the damage detection studies reviewed herein are summarized in the context of a statistical pattern recognition paradigm[1]. This paradigm can be described as a three-part process: (1) Data acquisition and cleansing, (2) Modal parameter identification, (3) Damage identification methods . However, offshore platform structures are very complex, and not easy to excite artificially and they are often suffered from ambient loads that cannot be controlled easily. The thesis focuses on three key issues for structural health monitoring via vibration in real offshore platform structures[2]. In the first part of review, the offshore platform structure health monitoring system basic principle and the composition are discussed. In the second portion, three important processes of structure health monitoring are summarized (Data acquisition and cleansing, modal parameter identification, damage identification methods), and each method good and bad points is pointed out. Next, Application of damage identification and structural health monitoring to offshore platform are in detail produced, the methods are described in general terms including difficulties associated with their implementation. Finally, current and future-planned applications of this technology to offshore platform are summarized. The paper concludes with a discussion of critical issues for future research on damage identification and structural health monitoring for offshore platform. Copyright Â© 2016 by ASME.

TI  - Sediment Accretion and Total Organic Carbon Accumulation Among Different Mangrove Vegetation Communities in the Kamora Estuary of Mimika Regency, Papua, Indonesia
AB  - A sediment accretion and carbon accumulation study was carried out in Kamora Estuary, Mimika Regency, Papua Province, Indonesia, to determine the accretion rate and total organic carbon loading in the area as well their correlation with geographical setting and mangrove aerial root type. The sediment stake method was used to measure the elevation changes, whereas the sediment trap method was used to determine sediment accretion and total organic carbon accumulation. Three locations were selected, namely at upstream, middle and downstream the mangrove communities, with each location installed up to 500 m perpendicular to the riverbank. The elevation changes based on sediment stakes were 8.4â€“12.3 mm year-1. Sediment accretion based on sediment traps was 18.5â€“25.4 mm year-1 or 1.88â€“2.98 g cm-2 year-1, while the mean total organic carbon accumulation was 736.8 Â±169 g m-2 year-1. The results are higher than those of similar studies in other regions, but they are consistent with other studies in Papua New Guinea. This study found that higher sediment accretion occurred at the riverbank compared with the interior area, while the elevation changes were greater in the upstream area. Higher relative density and higher basal area had a negative correlation with sediment accretion, but the number of roots had a positive correlation with sedimentation. The high sedimentation in the Kamora Estuary is resulting in the expansion of the mangrove forest at a rate of 3% year-1. Assisted mangrove colonization can be applied to expand the mangrove forest, especially considering the use of Rhizophora species, which this study found to be more effective at trapping sediment Â© 2021, Journal of Ecological Engineering.

TI  - OCEAN THERMAL-ENERGY CONVERSION (OTEC) SYSTEM AS A COUNTERMEASURE FOR CO2 PROBLEM - ENERGY-BALANCE AND CO2 REDUCTION POTENTIAL
AB  - We evaluated the energy balance of an ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) system that is one of the substitute energy sources. It was found that a 100 MW OTEC system reduces the amount of CO2 emission by 140,000 t-C/year, as compared with a 100 MW coal fired power plant. Its energy pay back time was calculated to be 0.46 year. In addition, the synergistic CO2 uptake effect by the compulsory circulation of the ocean was calculated to be 7,800 t-C/year for a 100 MW OTEC system on the basis of the difference between the present and pre-industrial CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere.

TI  - Estimating carbon emission and baseline for blue carbon ecosystems in indonesia
AB  - There is a good chance for Indonesia, the largest archipelagic state in the world, to contribute to climate change mitigation effort by optimizing the 'regulating and maintenance' ecosystem service in the form of 'blue carbon' function provided by mangrove and seagrass. These so called 'blue carbon' ecosystems have 3-5 times capacity of storing and sequestering carbon compared to terrestrial vegetation. This paper attempts to provide the estimation of baseline or Business as Usual (BAU) scenario for blue carbon ecosystems which would be required if formal emission inventory of 'blue carbon' ecosystems is to be implemented. The result shows mangrove degradation occurs both during base years of 2000 - 2016 and during the projected emission period of 2017 - 2030. Mangrove conversion to aquaculture pond is the main cause of degradation, contributing up to 72.50 % of the total carbon emission. Blue carbon climate change mitigation by mangrove rehabilitation can only reduce up to 6 % of carbon emission from baseline in 2030. Significant emission reduction of 73,38% from BAU emission in 2030 can only be achieved through integration of mangrove rehabilitation, silvofishery practice and the prevention of mangrove conversion to other land-uses.

TI  - Solar irradiance reduction via climate engineering: Impact of different techniques on the energy balance and the hydrological cycle
AB  - Different techniques of solar radiation management (SRM) have been suggested to counteract global warming, among them the injection of sulfur into the stratosphere, mirrors in space, and marine cloud brightening through artificial emissions of sea salt. This study focuses on to what extent climate impacts of these three methods would be different. We present results from simulations with an Earth system model where the forcing from the increase of greenhouse gases in a transient scenario (RCP4.5) was balanced over 50 years by SRM. While global mean temperature increases slightly due to the inertia of the climate system and evolves similar with time for the different SRM methods, responses of global mean precipitation differ considerably among the methods. The hydrological sensitivity is decreased by SRM, most prominently for aerosol-based techniques, sea salt emissions, and injection of sulfate into the stratosphere. Reasons for these differences are discussed through an analysis of the surface energy budget. Furthermore, effects on large-scale tropical dynamics and on regional climate are discussed.

TI  - Changing Biogeochemistry of the Southern Ocean and Its Ecosystem Implications
AB  - The Southern Ocean plays a critical role in regulating global climate as a major sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and in global ocean biogeochemistry by supplying nutrients to the global thermocline, thereby influencing global primary production and carbon export. Biogeochemical processes within the Southern Ocean regulate regional primary production and biological carbon uptake, primarily through iron supply, and support ecosystem functioning over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Here, we assimilate existing knowledge and present new data to examine the biogeochemical cycles of iron, carbon and major nutrients, their key drivers and their responses to, and roles in, contemporary climate and environmental change. Projected increases in iron supply, coupled with increases in light availability to phytoplankton through increased near-surface stratification and longer ice-free periods, are very likely to increase primary production and carbon export around Antarctica. Biological carbon uptake is likely to increase for the Southern Ocean as a whole, whilst there is greater uncertainty around projections of primary production in the Sub-Antarctic and basin-wide changes in phytoplankton species composition, as well as their biogeochemical consequences. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, higher trophic level organisms and microbial communities are strongly influenced by Southern Ocean biogeochemistry, in particular through nutrient supply and ocean acidification. In turn, these organisms exert important controls on biogeochemistry through carbon storage and export, nutrient recycling and redistribution, and benthic-pelagic coupling. The key processes described in this paper are summarised in the Graphical Abstract. Climate-mediated changes in Southern Ocean biogeochemistry over the coming decades are very likely to impact primary production, sea-air CO2 exchange and ecosystem functioning within and beyond this vast and critically important ocean region.

TI  - A Deepwater Dry-Tree GoM Solution: The FourStar TLP
AB  - SBM Atlantia have developed a Dry-Tree FourStar TLP with full drilling capability for GoM applications. This presentation focuses on the unique features of the Dry-Tree FourStar by considering a typical design example. Dry-Tree FourStar TLP considered is a 100,000 ton displacement structure with a payload of approximately 40,000 tons, designed for 4300 ft water depth. Like its wet-tree predecessor, the hull geometry follows the battered column form, which leads to increased stability for quayside integration, wet tow of the integrated system, and self-supported installation. Furthermore, the large keel footprint of the hull maximizes the efficiency of the tendon system. In order to enable quayside integration of the 22,000 ton topsides onto the FourStar hull, the deck is designed as three separate interconnecting modules. The Dry-Tree FourStar hull is structurally optimized for effective load transfer through the outer-shell of the structure, resulting in significantly lower hull steel densities when compared to industry standards. The design was confirmed through a comprehensive wave basin model test campaign performed at the Offshore Technology Research Center at Texas A\&M University. The model tests were performed at 1:50 scale, and utilized the latest GoM MetOcean criteria. The top-tensioned risers were included in the physical model in order to provide more realistic estimates of the hydrodynamic behavior of the TLP. The model tests confirmed the performance of the GoM Dry-Tree FourStar as a stable drilling and production platform. This paper presents the development of this TLP with emphasis on the hydrodynamic and structural aspects that are unique to the concept. It discusses the observations from the wave basin model tests, including the results of a comparison with a theoretical global performance analysis.

TI  - Protein recovery from underutilised marine bioresources for product development with nutraceutical and pharmaceutical bioactivities
AB  - The global demand for dietary proteins and protein-derived products are projected to dramatically increase which cannot be met using traditional protein sources. Seafood processing by-products (SPBs) and microalgae are promising resources that can fill the demand gap for proteins and protein derivatives. Globally, 32 million tonnes of SPBs are estimated to be produced annually which represents an inexpensive resource for protein recovery while technical advantages in microalgal biomass production would yield secure protein supplies with minimal competition for arable land and freshwater resources. Moreover, these biomaterials are a rich source of proteins with high nutritional quality while protein hydrolysates and biopeptides derived from these marine proteins possess several useful bioactivities for commercial applications in multiple industries. Efficient utilisation of these marine biomaterials for protein recovery would not only supplement global demand and save natural bioresources but would also successfully address the financial and environmental burdens of biowaste, paving the way for greener production and a circular economy. This comprehensive review analyses the potential of using SPBs and microalgae for protein recovery and production critically assessing the feasibility of current and emerging technologies used for the process development. Nutritional quality, functionalities, and bioactivities of the extracted proteins and derived products together with their potential applications for commercial product development are also systematically summarised and discussed.

TI  - A method to reproduce pH and Eh environmental changes due to sediment resuspension
AB  - During the last decades, metals have been released into coastal areas increasing the environmental and human health risks, however, resuspension events of trace metals polluted sediment could represent even more severe risks. Anoxic condition in the sediment is capable to stabilize the trace metals, due to the bonding with reduced anions. Although, the sediment resuspension can alter the potential redox and pH characteristics resulting in metals released from the water column. The climate change advance would impact directly on ocean chemistry, is expected the spatial increase of anoxic sites, mainly in coastal areas. Furthermore, it is mandatory and urgent to expand the knowledge over the process of sediment metals releasing in order to develop prediction and remediation tools for possible environmental impacts. This is a simple method of manipulating and simulating physicochemical alterations. The creation of microcosmos without oxygen allows the formation of a very reducible environment, common in coastal areas with low energy and high organic matter input. And further oxidation allows the assessment of the trace metals released to the water column and/or the new arrangement of these metals in different geochemical fractions. â€¢ The experimental procedure to assess trace metals mobility to potential redox and pH changes in sediment and water. â€¢ A method is suitable for a wild range of sediment characteristics.

TI  - Simulating a shape memory alloy buoyancy heat engine for undersea gliders
AB  - Undersea gliders are autonomous undersea vehicles (AUVs) that travel the world's oceans in a sawtooth climb-dive pattern. These gliders are driven by buoyancy engines that typically use electrically powered pumps to displace water with an oil bladder and thus enable a buoyancy change. Battery capacity limits the endurance of these types of engines and vehicles. The Argo project uses similar electrical buoyancy engines to help monitor climate change [1]. Increasing the endurance of buoyancy engines could have an impact on sensors deployed in the world's oceans by decreasing the maintenance cost of sensing missions and allowing for studies to be conducted over a longer period of time. Buoyancy heat engines driven by the naturally occurring thermocline that exists over a large expanse of the world's oceans can drastically improve endurance. These engines harness environmental energy as opposed to consuming electrical energy to change vehicle buoyancy. Buoyancy engines have been developed that employ the volume change produced during the phase change of wax [2], but it may also be possible to use the oceanic thermocline to drive a buoyancy heat engine based on shape memory alloys (SMA's) (Fig. 1). Shape memory alloys can recover a large amount of applied strain, up to approximately 10% [3], when heated due to a solid state phase transformation in the alloy. The high strain energy of shape memory alloys can be leveraged to create a lighter and more efficient buoyancy heat engine, but the performance and capability of a solid state SMA based engine is unknown. Previous work has discussed the analysis, design, and testing of such an engine, called the shape memory alloy buoyancy heat engine (SMA-BHE) [4]. This paper will examine the dynamics of the SMABHE by coupling a lumped system heat transfer model and the Brinson model for one-dimensional SMA constitutive behavior to the kinematics of a notional undersea glider in an ocean environment. Including the Brinson model and other known SMA relations in the kinematic simulation of a notional glider led to a model that predicted successful AUV operation with a SMA-BHE at depths past 700 m.

TI  - Jacksonville District hydrocyclone experience
AB  - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, continues to pursue hydrocyclone technology in expanding its capabilities and improving efficiencies in its multi-tasked dredging missions. Recent favorable bench-top hydrocyclone/maximum density separation technology testing has been conducted on contaminated Miami River sediments. These bench-top tests and follow-on flocculation processing have added to the knowledge base and demonstrated the technological capability of providing desired splits of sand, silt, and contaminates. Available up-to-date processing results are presented. Five, 30 gallon, Miami River contaminated sediment samples were processed through a six-inch maximum density separator obtaining a non-toxic sand split suitable for construction use and a toxic silty cohesive slurry. Flocculation processing of the resulting slurry was found to favorably increase settling rates by a factor of about 60, from 1-2 hours to about 1-2 minutes. The resulting overlying water was found to be clear, free of contaminants, and suitable for direct discharge back into the estuarine system. The reduced volume of settled finer-grained contaminated material would require reduced acreage in a confined upland disposal site. Positive bench-top test results clearly demonstrate the capabilities of this new coastal dredging technology for use in varied Corps of Engineers dredging missions'. Questions related to additional potential dewatering, site/land requirements for application processing and upland disposal, and resulting production rates remain unanswered. A pilot demonstration project is recommended to thoroughly address these and other cost effectiveness questions. Hydrocyclone technology has potential use in beach nourishment activities by removing the finer- grained particles in maintenance dredged materials, thereby increasing the amount of available beach quality sand.

TI  - Taking the third generation multiphase meter subsea - Challenges and design choices
AB  - This paper presents an overview of the processes, design and technology choices behind taking the latest multiphase meter (with new measurement, visualization and tomographic techniques) subsea. The paper will look at applications for the new meter and the benefits of designing a subsea version. With Asian operators' increased focus on EOR and flow assurance, harsher offshore environments and production over a wider range of process conditions, the new meter will have significant applications for accurately measuring flow rates under varied conditions. The paper will describe the development process behind the new subsea meter. It will examine how a new flow computer was developed to enhance communications, the extended GVF range, and improved salinity measurements to allow more accurate measurements of flow in high water liquid ratio (WLR) and when GVF is high. The paper will look at the design challenges in adapting what was previously a topside meter for HP/HT environments subsea and the challenges of developing a more compact version without technology compromises. This compactness is crucial, with many subsea manifolds in Asian fields already crowded with instrumentation. The paper will provide an important technical contribution towards the goal of increasing flow assurance in Asia's offshore fields and will demonstrate how the new design concept and technology will be crucial for more complex condition monitoring and intelligent metering in the future.

TI  - An assessment of tree biodiversity and carbon stocks in mangrove forests, Langsa City, Aceh, Indonesia
AB  - Mangrove forests are a unique coastal ecosystem with trees adapted to a constantly fluctuating and sometimes extreme physical environment. Mangrove forests provide important ecosystem services that benefit local people and all of us in terms of climate regulation through the storage of greenhouse gasses in biomass. This research reports carbon stock, wood volume, tree density, and biodiversity indices for two mangrove forest areas in Langsa City Regency, Aceh Province, Indonesia. The two sites represent and inland area and an ocean-exposed area within a large mangrove forest ecosystem complex. The results of the analysis show that these two tracts are quite similar in terms of carbon stock and biodiversity even though they occupy different locations within the larger tract of mangrove habitat. The study confirms these are healthy forest areas with relatively high carbon stocks. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Methane Production from Gas Hydrate Deposits through Injection of Supercritical CO2
AB  - The recovery of natural gas from CH4-hydrate deposits in sub-marine and sub-permafrost environments through injection of CO2 is considered a suitable strategy towards emission-neutral energy production. This study shows that the injection of hot, supercritical CO2 is particularly promising. The addition of heat triggers the dissociation of CH4-hydrate while the CO2, once thermally equilibrated, reacts with the pore water and is retained in the reservoir as immobile CO2-hydrate. Furthermore, optimal reservoir conditions of pressure and temperature are constrained. Experiments were conducted in a high-pressure flow-through reactor at different sediment temperatures (2 degrees C, 8 degrees C, 10 degrees C) and hydrostatic pressures (8 MPa, 13 MPa). The efficiency of both, CH4 production and CO2 retention is best at 8 degrees C, 13 MPa. Here, both CO2- and CH4-hydrate as well as mixed hydrates can form. At 2 degrees C, the production process was less effective due to congestion of transport pathways through the sediment by rapidly forming CO2-hydrate. In contrast, at 10 degrees C CH4 production suffered from local increases in permeability and fast breakthrough of the injection fluid, thereby confining the accessibility to the CH4 pool to only the most prominent fluid channels. Mass and volume balancing of the collected gas and fluid stream identified gas mobilization as equally important process parameter in addition to the rates of methane hydrate dissociation and hydrate conversion. Thus, the combination of heat supply and CO2 injection in one supercritical phase helps to overcome the mass transfer limitations usually observed in experiments with cold liquid or gaseous CO2.

TI  - Making time-lapse seismic work in a complex desert environment for CO2 EOR monitoring-Design and acquisition
AB  - Onshore seismic monitoring for CO2 injection in carbonate reservoirs in the Middle East is a major challenge for many reasons. The 4D signal is generally much smaller than that of clastic or chalk reservoirs due to the high bulk moduli of the rocks and the relatively small fluid effect. In addition, seismic data are characterized by low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) due to poor signal penetration below high-contrast near-surface layers, poorly consolidated materials at the surface, conversion of source energy into surface waves and trapped modes, and scattering from near-surface complexities. Seasonal variations in surface conditions combined with low S/N make acquisition and processing of 4D seismic data some of the greatest challenges in geophysics today. We show results from feasibility and field pilot seismic programs for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) monitoring that resulted in successful imaging of CO2 injection in such a challenging onshore environment and achieved 4D metrics comparable with offshore seismic monitoring. The final acquisition choice included a hybrid surface source/buried receiver system with point sensors and sources based on cost and effectiveness of the various technologies tested. Acquisition included continuous monitoring with a full 3D survey acquired once every four weeks for a period of several years. Burying sparser receivers with dense source coverage minimized 4D noise to acceptable levels (&lt; 5% normalized root mean square) and allowed fluid saturation changes from CO2 EOR to be observed.

TI  - Sustainability and structural resilience of building integrated photovoltaics subjected to typhoon strength winds
AB  - The Western Pacific sees more tropical typhoons and storms annually as compared to other ocean basins. The destructive typhoons caused economic and infrastructure damage and have left many devastated communities. The use of solar photovoltaic power is also increasing, and in the event of extended power cuts, it can provide power to the affected communities, particularly during the response and recovery periods. However, solar installations are also vulnerable to typhoon-force winds and can suffer extensive damages. Currently, limited work has been conducted on approaches that optimise solar panels installation in low-rise residential buildings in terms of structural and energy performance. A solution that can reduce solar installation damage and frequency is necessary, especially for developing countries. A framework based on fluidâ€“structure interaction (FSI) modelling and building energy simulation (BES) was proposed to evaluate roof-mounted solar panels' structural and energy performance. The FSI simulation was carried out for a typical low-rise building design with solar panels subjected to typhoon-strength approach winds. Different configurations were simulated in BES to predict the building energy demand and optimise the solar photovoltaic energy generation. Based on the evaluated configurations and conditions, it was observed that the panels failed on the roof's leeward side, and maximum destruction occurs at 45Â° wind direction. A balance between structural resilience and energy generation was observed for the building with a roof pitch of 37Â°, sustaining the occupant's energy requirements even in the face of typhoons and other extreme storms. The framework proposed in this study can support decision-makers and stakeholders in planning and designing typhoon resilient solar PV rooftop installations. Â© 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Formation and development of seabed trenching from subsea inspection data of deepwater gulf of Guinea moorings
AB  - It is now recognized that seabed trenching in taut deep water moorings can reach the suction anchor and the chain padeye depth, with the safety of the mooring system becoming a concern. However, the actual formation of such trenches and their development with time are still largely unknown, as well as the relation with the characteristics and dynamics of the mooring systems. The analysis of a database of subsea inspection data from deep water Gulf of Guinea mooring systems is presented. The trench data, from in-service subsea inspections of mooring systems for five FPSO vessels and off-loading terminal buoys, comprise the measurement of trenches width and depth and of anchor-to-trench distances. Because similar metocean and soil conditions apply to the ten mooring systems, the study offers a unique database for better understanding the formation and evolution of this seabed trenching. The subsea inspections were carried out between 2014 and 2017 but the study covers a much larger time span of moorings performance as the FPSOs and off-loading buoys were installed between 17 years and 5 years ago. The trench development is studied in relation with the moorings characteristics and dynamics and is illustrated with typical features and trench geometries for the two types of floaters. The results obtained represent a key improvement for understanding this seabed trenching phenomenon and are most probably applicable to all deep water moorings of the Gulf of Guinea area. Preliminary recommendations about design aspects and possible mitigations that can be considered for limiting the seabed trenching are also addressed in the paper.

TI  - Comparison of organic Rankine cycle concepts for recovering waste heat in a hybrid powertrain on a fast passenger ferry
AB  - The possibilities of recovering waste heat from the exhaust gas and other waste heat sources from a 900 kW fast passenger ferry Diesel engine by means of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) were investigated. The recovered energy is to be used in a parallel hybrid powertrain, which would allow for electric propulsion and thus low emissions near stopovers while electricity generated by the ORC when the engine is running at cruising speed is stored in a battery. The benefit of such a solution is that there would be no extra load on the engine and increased fuel consumption while the local emissions around the stopovers could be reduced, which is especially desirable in urban environments. Simple organic Rankine-cycles with and without internal energy regeneration and an organic Rankine cycle with two different heat sources have been modelled. Different working fluid candidates have been compared by means of a simple optimization routine with respect to the maximum recoverable amount of work from the cyclesâ€™ expander. The method is applied to a vessel serving a typical short fast passenger ferry route between the harbour of the Western Norwegian city of Bergen and the neighbouring AskÃ¸y municipality.

TI  - Learnings from the high temperature water based mud application in offshore sarawak
AB  - A total of 5 production wells were planned in a gas field development project located in offshore Sarawak, Malaysia. The reservoir section of the field is comprised of two massive pinnacle carbonate structures, characterized by heterogeneous porosity and permeability, with high occurrence of vugs and faults. Severe to total loss circulation was expected while drilling this reservoir coupled with high temperature environment with prognosed bottomhole temperature (BHT) of 370Â°F. Considering the high risk of loss circulation, the drilling fluids strategy involved designing and testing of a high temperature tolerant Water Based Mud (WBM) system as a base case plan to drill the reservoir in the scenario of sustainable losses. The HT WBM system was designed using HT polymers for filtration control and viscosity. The fluid was stressed at 370Â°F and prepared at a density of 14.5 lb/gal (1.74 SG). The high density mud system prompted the requirement to control the rheology for improved ECD management while drilling the reservoir section. Other criterias for the fluids design were the ability to demonstrate low barite sagging tendencies at extended static aging time as well as improved HTHP filtration control. The final formulation was also subjected to a formation damage testing to evaluate the fluids impact towards reservoir impairment. The HT WBM system was a milestone for the operator as being the hottest HT WBM ever deployed in Malaysia operation. High geological uncertainties in the area led towards unexpected long shale exposure while drilling the reservoir section in both mainbore and sidetrack wells. While the mainhole was drilled successfully with the HT WBM system, the sidetracked well experienced significant reduction in the rate of penetration (ROP), suspected from bit balling despite having additional inhibition material in the system. The field observations, prompted additional learnings towards improvement of the HT WBM formulation as well as recommended lab testing considerations to further evaluate the performance of the mud system.

TI  - Supersonic separator for cleaner offshore processing of supercritical fluid with ultra-high carbon dioxide content: Economic and environmental evaluation
AB  - Offshore gas processing presents challenges, especially when high flow rates, high-pressure and high carbon dioxide contents are involved. The present scenario comprehends offshore processing of high flow rate of high-pressure natural gas with 68%mol carbon dioxide, which results from oil production and behaves as a dense supercritical fluid. The processing goals with this fluid comprise: [A] water dew-point adjustment; [B] hydrocarbon dew-point adjustment; [C] decarbonation of a small part to 20%mol carbon dioxide fuel-gas for power production; and [D] compression/pumping of the remaining fluid enriched with carbon dioxide from decarbonation for enhanced oil recovery. For these tasks the industry considers traditional well established processes such as molecular-sieves adsorption for water dew-point adjustment, Joule-Thompson expansion for hydrocarbon dew-point adjustment and membrane-permeation for carbon dioxide removal. However, conventional technologies can become cumbersome in such awkward conditions. Thus, unconventional solutions are sought for reliability, lower equipment size/weight, and better power consumption, emissions and environmental sustainability. Recently, supersonic separators have been analyzed in proof-of-concept researches for natural gas processing. In this regard, this work quantitatively proves that goals [A],[B],[C] are achievable using only supersonic separators, attaining 33% higher net value, 40% greater oil production, 10% lower investment and economic leverage to reach lower carbon emission relatively to conventional counterparts.

The energy harvesting robotic buoy is proposed in the context. The proposed system is composed of three components: propulsion system, energy harvesting system, and buoyancy control system. The proposed system can hold its position within an uniform bound without mooring, and harvests wave energy.

Through the simulation, we implemented station keeping algorithm, and investigated optimal design parameters. To verify the simulation results we constructed prototype and carried out a series of experiments: station-keeping test, and power generation test.

TI  - Cored-wire arc spray fabrication of novel aluminium-copper coatings for anti-corrosion/fouling hybrid performances
AB  - The booming ocean economy in recent decades crucially demands advanced anti-corrosion technologies for marine infrastructures. Among the marine protective coatings developed in past decades, thermal sprayed aluminium coating was evidenced to be one of the most economical and efficient corrosion protection layers. Yet, marine corrosion is always accompanied by biofouling which in most cases accelerates corrosion. Here we report arc spray fabrication of novel aluminium-copper coatings using home-made Al-Cu cored wires for both anti-corrosion and antifouling performances. Copper particles were dispersed in the as-sprayed coatings, and TEM characterization further revealed partial interaction of Cu particles with Al matrix during the coating deposition. The chemical reaction with the formation of Al2Cu offered an anchoring effect for the coatings preventing Cu particles from quick releasing into aqueous environment. Electrochemical testing in artificial seawater showed that the presence of Cu in Al coatings did not trigger considerable deterioration in corrosion resistance. Further antifouling testing of the coatings by examining settlement and colonization behaviors of bacteria E. coli and Bacillus sp. and typical marine algae revealed their excellent antifouling performances. The antifouling properties were predominately attributed to the continuous release of copper ions from the coatings. The results give clear insight into constructing anti-corrosion/fouling inorganic coatings by the cored-wire arc spray technical route for marine applications.

TI  - Deep injection and the potential of biochar to reduce fumigant emissions and effects on nematode control
AB  - Reducing fumigant emissions is essential for minimizing the environmental impacts of pre-plant soil fumigation. Low permeability plastic films are effective at reducing emissions but have high initial purchase, installation, and disposal costs. The objective of this study was to evaluate if deep fumigant injection and biochar soil amendments can reduce emissions, improve fumigant distribution in soil, and provide acceptable control of plant parasitic nematodes. A pre-plant soil fumigation trial was conducted in a commercial orchard in the San Joaquin Valley, CA, USA. Treatments included two rates of Telone(center dot) C-35 (a mixture of 1,3-dichloropropene and chloropicrin) under totally impermeable film or with no surface seal, two injection depths (45 or 65 cm), and two biochar rates (20 or 40 ton ha(-1)). Emission rates were generally low due to rain events encountered during the trial, but data clearly showed that the deep injection enhanced fumigant delivery to depths below 60 cm and resulted in significantly lower peak emission compared to the standard injection depth. Biochar applied at 40 ton ha(-1 )had the lowest emission rates during 1-month monitoring period. Although variability in nematode survival was high, tarped, deep injection, and biochar treatment showed lower survival of nematodes at various depths. Increase in fumigant persistence, especially chloropicrin, was observed in this study, likely due to the high soil moisture and low temperature. All data indicate that biochar amendments can help reduce fumigant emissions without reducing nematode control; however, additional research is needed to optimize treatments, determine the affordability of various biochar materials, and validate results under a range of field conditions.

TI  - Variability in the organic carbon stocks, sources, and accumulation rates of Indonesian mangrove ecosystems
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are an important natural carbon sink that accumulate and store large amounts of organic carbon (C org ), in particular in the sediment. However, the magnitude of carbon stocks and the rate of carbon accumulation (CAR) vary geographically due to a large variation of local factors. In order to better understand the blue carbon sink of mangrove ecosystems, we measured organic carbon stocks, sources and accumulation rates in three Indonesian mangrove ecosystems with different environmental settings and conditions; (i) a degraded estuarine mangrove forest in the Segara Anakan Lagoon (SAL), Central Java, (ii) an undegraded estuarine mangrove forest in Berau region, East Kalimantan, and (iii) a pristine marine mangrove forest on Kongsi Island, Thousand Islands, Jakarta. In general, C org stocks were higher in estuarine than in marine mangroves, although a large variation was observed among the estuarine mangroves. The mean total C org stock in Berau (615 Â± 181 Mg C ha âˆ’1 ) is twice as high as that in SAL (298 Â± 181 Mg C ha âˆ’1 ). However, the Segara Anakan Lagoon displayed large within-system variation with a much higher C org stock in the eastern (483 Â± 124 Mg C ha âˆ’1 ) than in the central lagoon (167 Â± 36 Mg C ha âˆ’1 ). The predominant accumulation of autochthonous mangrove organic matter likely contributed to the higher C org stocks in Berau and the eastern SAL. Interestingly, the CAR distribution pattern in SAL is opposite to that of its C org stocks. The central SAL that receives high sediment inputs from the hinterland has a much higher CAR than the eastern SAL (658 Â± 311 g C m âˆ’2 yr âˆ’1 and 194 Â± 46 g C m âˆ’2 yr âˆ’1 , respectively), while Berau has one of the highest CAR (1722 Â± 183 g C m âˆ’2 yr âˆ’1 ) ever measured. It appears that these large differences are driven by the environmental setting and conditions, mainly sediment dynamics and hydrodynamics, landform, and vegetation conditions. It is inferred that quantifying carbon accumulation in sediments is a useful tool in estimating the present-day carbon storage of mangrove ecosystems. This is a precondition for taking measures under REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries) schemes.

TI  - Solar-macro-alage based biogas hybrid system for future offshore installation
AB  - Marine algae biomass energy source is increasing getting approval from policy maker and community. Beside production of seaweed for biomass energy has potential economic benefits in Malaysia. Prototype plantations have been deployed in coastal areas and therefore are competing for limited space with other shoreside activities such as recreation and industry. If seaweed can be cultivated in relatively deeper waters away from populated areas, production may be expanded using larger areas not presently exploited for other purposes. Prototype systems aquaculture plantations have so far relied on ad hoc, field developed mooring systems, rather than engineering design principles. Such systems may not be sufficiently reliable for deepwater deployments, where repairs are more costly and resources are scarce. Considerable experience and hands-on knowledge has been obtained, the design concepts can be used as a basis for further improvements. The paper describe integrative approach to ocean energy by combining capability of solar and biogas.

TI  - Westport Malaysia port expansion study
AB  - The port company at Westport, located within Port Klang on the Western side of the Malaysian Peninsular, is proposing to extend the existing port through the construction of 8 additional container terminals. The proposal calls for reclaiming low-lying intertidal flats, constructing of 4.75 km of piled wharfs and capital dredging to provide draft for post panamax ships. A MKE21 numerical study, supported by field investigations, was used to assess the potential impact of the proposed container terminal on the coastal environment. The modelling focused on hydrodynamics, nearshore wave climate, sedimentation and the extent of the sediment plume during dredging and reclamation works. The overall effect of the proposed Stage I development on the physical coastal environment is relatively minor. There is potential for greater effects from Stage II, with increased tidal flows, sedimentation and increased exposure to wave energy. The main effects are changes to the seabed and sedimentation patterns due to modified tidal flows that will need to be addressed by ongoing maintenance dredging. There is no significant effect on shoreline physical processes due to the relatively mild ambient hydrodynamic conditions that exist at this location and the predominantly armoured coastline. Construction effects are limited to water quality issues during the dredging and reclamation construction processes. However, considering the relatively high ambient suspended sediment and turbidity conditions, the impacts from the dredging is expected to be relatively minor.

TI  - Model Predictive Control of Marine Power Plants With Gas Engines and Battery
AB  - The electric load demand on marine vessels is constantly changing during some operational modes, such as in harsh weather or complex operations. Therefore, diesel engines are typically used to handle these variations. Gas engines reduce the CO2 due to lower carbon content in LNG compared with diesel oil. However, they may not be able to handle the load variations of a marine power plant. There are multiple other energy sources with strict rate constraints, such as slow speed diesel engines and fuel cells. In such cases, a battery may be used to take care of the variations, while the generator set produces a slowly varying power. In this paper, a common power flow controller for the battery and the generator set is proposed. It utilizes the rotating inertia in the generator set as energy storage, in addition to a battery. This is done by allowing a small excursion in the speed of the generator set; the speed change will change the kinetic energy of the generator set and this is used analogously to energy storage. The controller is compared with a baseline controller based on virtual inertia and speed droop. A simulation study is included to demonstrate the performance of the control methods. The simulation study shows that the gas engine (with strict constraints) is not able to handle the given load series. Nonetheless, it can be used in combination with a battery to handle the variations. The power plant can handle a measured load series from an offshore vessel when either speed-droop control or model predictive control is used. However, the study indicates that by using MPC, the aging of the batteries and fuel rate variations can be reduced.

TI  - Self-sensing health of carbon composite pultrusion strength members
AB  - In applications such as race boat rigging, offshore umbilicals and energy kite tethers which require light weight and high stiffness strength members, there is no better material choice than carbon composite pultrusion. However, designing an optimized termination profile for fatigue driven applications is time consuming and generating stress versus cycle to failure (S-N) curves is expensive. Fortunately, owing to electrical properties inherent in carbon pultrusions, self-sensing techniques can be correlated to microscopic damage to provide useful new metrics on which to base design specifications. This paper presents a new technique for self-sensing health via 4-wire method of carbon composite pultrusion materials in gauge and termination region of a full-scale system. This self-sensing method sheds light into system stress state and permits measurement of damage from crack propagation due to fatigue using robust and widely available tools. These self-sensing signals have clear potential utility for speeding design tasks, defining lifetime ratings and providing real-time system diagnostics of high performance strength members.

TI  - Electrocoagulation treatment for reverse electrodialysis wastewater from petroleum refinery
AB  - The present study investigated an evaluation efficiency of electrocoagulation (EC) for the pretreatment of a saline concentrated effluent from the reverse electrodialysis (RED-C) stage from an oil refinery, aiming at water reuse in the industrial process. In this approach, an electrocoagulation system with 1 L capacity was set up for batch treatment using aluminum electrodes. Initially, experiments with a semi-synthetic RED-C effluent were assessed for contaminants removal using fixed current density of 8.30 mA/cm2 and 1 cm distance between electrodes. The influence of initial pH (5 and 7), controlled temperature (20, 30 and 40Â°C) and operation time (60 and 120 min) on removal efficiency was investigated and solid residue were measured. The results showed that the optimum conditions were at pH 7 and 20-30Â°C with removal rates around 70%, 57%, 10% and 44% for Ca, Sr, Na and COD, respectively. Thereafter, experiments were conducted with a real RED-C using the best condition founded in preliminary tests, this time applying a current density of 5 and 10 mA/cm2 and 0.5 cm distance at room temperature (approximately 23Â°C). Regarding the tests with real RED-C, for both current densities the removals were greater due to decrease in distance between electrodes and larger temperature range that improved electrocoagulation. In general, the use of current density of 10 mA/cm2 and reduction of inter-electrode distance increased EC efficiency which exhibited removal rates of 88%, 77%, 26% and 24% for Ca, Sr, Na and COD, respectively. Although, it was observed a decrease in COD removal from real RED-C due to the addition of inorganic ions in the semisynthetic effluent that precipitated as salts, removing more organic as a coadjuvant compound. The solid slugde production for this same condition were 5.65 g/L. Â© 2019, Offshore Technology Conference

TI  - Basic study on CO2 sequestration in the oceans
AB  - This report consists of two Parts. Part I deals with a bibliographical survey concerning methods of CO2 sequestration in the ocean. In chapter 1, the background of the earth warming issue and the authors' position on this matter are discussed. In chapter 2, two basic measures of CO2 treatment in the ocean, that is, the ways to dissolve CO2 in the ocean and to store CO2 in the ocan basin, are introduced, and unsolved problems in both of the methods are explained. Part II treats in detail the results of various kinds of experiments conducted by using two high-pressure-loop tanks which simulate the pressure and temperature of the ocean at 700 meters and 3000 meters deep respectivaly. In chapters 3, the dissolution rate and ascending velocity of a single CO2 droplet in the condition of about 500 meters deep ocean are discussed and the maximum diameter of CO2 droplets permitted in the dissolution method is estimated. In chapter 4, the results of serveral experiments indispensable to the assessment of CO2 storage method in the ocean basin, such as the temperature dependence of dissolution rate of a CO2 droplet covered with CO2 hydrate film and the stability of stratified CO2-rich water layer appeared above a stored CO2 lake, are explained. In chapter 5, pH numbers of CO2-rich sea water at 30 MPa which represent the impact of the acidification around a CO2 storage site on the ocean environment are treated.

TI  - PelagiCam: a novel underwater imaging system with computer vision for semi-automated monitoring of mobile marine fauna at offshore structures
AB  - Engineered structures in the open ocean are becoming more frequent with the expansion of the marine renewable energy industry and offshore marine aquaculture. Floating engineered structures function as artificial patch reefs providing novel and relatively stable habitat structure not otherwise available in the pelagic water column. The enhanced physical structure can increase local biodiversity and benefit fisheries yet can also facilitate the spread of invasive species. Clear evidence of any ecological consequences will inform the design and placement of structures to either minimise negative impacts or enhance ecosystem restoration. The development of rapid, cost-effective and reliable remote underwater monitoring methods is crucial to supporting evidence-based decision-making by planning authorities and developers when assessing environmental risks and benefits of offshore structures. A novel, un-baited midwater video system, PelagiCam, with motion-detection software (MotionMeerkat) for semi-automated monitoring of mobile marine fauna, was developed and tested on the UKâ€™s largest offshore rope-cultured mussel farm in Lyme Bay, southwest England. PelagiCam recorded Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), garfish (Belone belone) and two species of jellyfish (Chrysaora hysoscella and Rhizostoma pulmo) in open water close to the floating farm structure. The software successfully distinguished video frames where fishes were present versus absent. The PelagiCam system provides a cost-effective remote monitoring tool to streamline biological data acquisition in impact assessments of offshore floating structures. With the rise of sophisticated artificial intelligence for object recognition, the integration of computer vision techniques should receive more attention in marine ecology and has great potential to revolutionise marine biological monitoring.

TI  - The principal external costs and benefits of marine mineral recovery
AB  - Investments in resource development by private enterprise will produce socially optimal results in only those instances where (1) monopoly power by private enterprise and unjustified interference with the market mechanism by government axe absent, and (2) external (spillover) benefits and costs are absent. Government interference in order to raise the price of oil has caused a significant divergence between private and social benefits such that over-investment in oil exploration and development has resulted in serious resource misallocation. For marine minerals requiring major technological innovations in deep sea dredges as a prerequisite to development, the technological external benefits appear to be sufficiently large to constitute a prima facie case for a public subsidy. However, the amount of such a justified subsidy still does not appear sufficient to render deep sea manganese recovery profitable in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, there are external costs due to marine mineral recovery. These spillover costs are particularly evident in near-shore oil recovery. Efficient resource allocation within a free enterprise system requires that all externalities be internalized so that they enter into the profitability calculations of those economic units affecting the development of natural resources.

TI  - Electrocatalytic fuel cell desalination for continuous energy and freshwater generation
AB  - Advanced hydrogen technologies contribute essentially to the decarbonization of our industrialized world. Large-scale hydrogen production would benefit from using the abundantly available water reservoir of our planet's oceans. Current seawater-desalination technologies suffer from high energy consumption, high cost, or low performance. Here, we report technology for water desalination at seawater molarity, based on a polymer ion-exchange membrane fuel cell, By continuously supplying hydrogen and oxygen to the cell, a 160-mM concentration decrease from an initial value of 600 mM is accomplished within 40 h for a 55-mL reservoir This device's desalination rate in 600 mM NaCl and substitute ocean water are 18 g/m(2)/h and 16 g/m(2)/h, respectively. In addition, by removing 1 g of NaCl, 67 mWh of electric energy is generated. This proof-of-concept work shows the high application potential for sustainable fuel-cell desalination (FCD) using hydrogen as an energy carrier.

TI  - Global nitrogen deposition and carbon sinks
AB  - Land and ocean uptake of carbon dioxide plays a critical role in determining atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Future increases in nitrogen deposition have been predicted to increase the size of these terrestrial and marine carbon sinks, but although higher rates of nitrogen deposition might enhance carbon uptake in northern and tropical forests, they will probably have less of an impact on ocean sink strength. Combined, the land and ocean sinks may sequester an additional 10\% of anthropogenic cabon emissions by 2030 owing to increased nitrogen inputs, but a more conservative estimate of 1 to 2\% is more likely. Thus nitrogen-induced increases in the strength of land and ocean sinks are unlikely to keep pace with future increases in carbon dioxide.
