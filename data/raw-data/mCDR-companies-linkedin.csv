(""Ocean-based""​) is focused on leveraging and amplifying the ocean's natural countermeasures to climate change. The oceans cover 70% of the earth's surface and absorb up to 50% of excess CO2 from fossil fuel emissions. But recent studies suggest this natural carbon sink is declining due to warming.

Our suite of ocean technologies can help restore and amplify these natural processes without any negative impact on marine ecosystems.

Ocean-based is a privately-held company based in the USA, whose parent company Atmocean, Inc. (www.atmocean.com), was founded in 2006. It was recognized as a wave energy leader in 2012 by Sandia National Laboratories; awarded grants from Oregon Wave Energy Trust and the UK Technology Strategies Board; since 2006, conducted over 100 days of ocean testing offshore Texas, California, Oregon, Hawaii, Peru, and Newfoundland Canada; and performed wave tank testing at Plymouth University (UK), and Texas A&M University.

This year, Ocean-based is pleased to introduce its Corporate Gigaton Challenge as an alternative financing mechanism to remove CO2. The target is one gigaton of cumulative CO2 removed within 15 years, using technologies provided by Ocean-based.

Under this program, multinational corporations fund the deployment of CO2-removal technologies by issuing common stock rather than paying in cash. Rather than reduce corporate earnings, this program expands the number of shares issued, with the corporate market capitalization recovered as investors allocate more funds to public companies with higher ""ESG""​ profiles. With higher market cap, the net result is the company eliminates its CO2 footprint at zero or even ""negative""​ cost.

When large amounts of this seaweed hit coastal communities, they cause both ecological and economic damage.

We are developing BoatBots to intercept and sink this invasive seaweed before it reaches the shore. This will protect coral reefs, sea turtles, and native seaweed habitats, while also preserving the beauty of beaches that attract tourists—an essential source of income for local economies.

By sinking the seaweed to sufficient depths, we effectively lock away carbon for centuries, helping to mitigate climate change by reducing the overall CO2 in the atmosphere and its contribution to the greenhouse effect.

With $25,000 in angel investment and a pilot pre-sale of $10,000 in future carbon removal, we are poised to tap into the growing market for emission reversal technologies. This demand will only increase as corporations seek to meet their net-zero targets.

A recent report suggests the global carbon removal market could reach $100 billion annually by 2035.

We aim to provide a simple, fast-acting and direct way to make a demonstrable difference in the pursuit of net zero emissions. Join us in this exciting nature-based adventure.

Local community is very important to us, so each one of our farms is created with that in mind. It’s called a circular economy, and we will work with communities to integrate our farms to create these new circular economies – an approach to raw materials (in this case), where everything has value, nothing is wasted, and the environment benefits. For example, we grow seaweed to extract excess CO₂. The seaweed is then turned into biochar, which can be given to local farmers to improve soil quality, or even used to create low-carbon cement and made into the anchors securing our seaweed ropes. We work with local communities to identify opportunities to create a circular economy.

By accelerating the natural weathering of silicate rocks, we introduce naturally occurring minerals into shallow ocean waters. These minerals react with CO₂ in the seawater, transforming it into stable carbonates and bicarbonates, locking away carbon securely for over 100,000 years. Along the way, this process boosts ocean alkalinity, counteracting ocean acidification and supporting healthier, thriving marine ecosystems.

Decarbonizing the global economy is the Apollo Moon Shot of this century. Every serious plan to keep global temperatures below dangerous limits requires carbon removal at the scale of billions of tons of CO2 per year. But a giant gap exists between this pressing need and existing carbon removal capabilities that are costly, energy intensive, and have a capacity 10,000x too small. 

Unlike nature-based approaches to carbon capture, Banyu Carbon is developing a process that produces a pure stream of CO2 for easily verified carbon credits to companies and governments. 

The Banyu Carbon process uses the surface ocean as a vast collector for atmospheric CO2 and then removes the accumulated carbon through energy efficient photochemical reactions. Seawater naturally concentrates CO2 from the atmosphere. Removing this carbon from the surface ocean withdraws a commensurate amount of CO2 from the air because of rapid equilibration. Because the atmosphere rapidly mixes carbon emissions from across the globe and then the oceans readily absorb this extra carbon, the Banyu Carbon process would reduce atmospheric CO2 no matter where the emissions occurred.

Biostimulants increase:

-yields.

WHAT’S THE PROBLEM? 
Per year, humanity is using natural capital 1.7 times as fast as Earth can renew it.   For our futures sake, this must change. 
Cost-effective, long term and environmentally sustainable alternatives must be found to restore the planet to equilibrium, or even abundance.

Why is Kelp Blue an answer? 
Giant Kelp one of the fastest growing organism on the planet and is well suited for use in a range of products from high quality pharma/neutraceuticals to fertiliser, animal feed, dietary supplements and textiles. Growing the marketplace for existing kelp products as well as using giant kelp derivatives to displace environmentally damaging alternatives will help restore the planets equilibrium; growing kelp requires no fertilisers, no pesticides, no land and no fresh water.  
But more importantly, it has the ability to draw down more CO2 than terrestrial forests while boosting marine biodiversity and improving fish stocks.   

Why KELP BLUE? 
We are passionate about scaling a profitable nature-based solution that will help reverse climate change.  Our model can quickly grow across  different markets helping to change the course of multiple industries from being environmentally damaging to being environmentally positive.",15804,,,,Found

Yet, lowering emissions alone will not be sufficient to meet the set climate targets. We must also investigate approaches that actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere.

Coastal enhanced silicate weathering as a negative emissions technology uses the natural process of silicate weathering for the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. Not only does this technique increase the CO2 sequestration capacity of our oceans, it also counteracts ocean acidification and can be directly integrated into existing coastal management programs.

However, so far there has not yet been a rigorous assessment of the CO2 sequestration efficiency and environmental impact of enhanced silicate weathering. This project addresses these critical bottlenecks. The Coastal Carbon project investigates the potential of enhanced silicate weathering in coastal environments by studying the processes at those locations where silicate weathering is naturally occurring and by operation of a large scale mesocosm setup.

Coastal Carbon is an interdisciplinary research project executed in collaboration between three Belgian universities, Flemish and Belgian research institutes and commercial partners: University of Antwerp, Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ), Ghent University, DEME, Sibelco, CO2-Logic, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and the Research Foundation – Flanders (FWO) as our funding agency .",40,,,,Found

We are working to moderate and reverse the effects of climate change in critical ecosystems, including; 


Developing agricultural use of biochar to sequester gigatons of carbon for millennia.
Incorporating biochar as sanitation, fertilizer substrate and carbon sequestration in lean regions.
Balancing carbon in the oceans by restoring natural processes at work for eons to reduce carbon in surface waters. 
Reversing coral bleaching on high-value coral reefs to preserve portions of these ecosystems during the high-temperature decades to come. 
Encouraging and facilitating the adoption of renewable energy for electricity and transportation in place of fossil fuels throughout the world, including:
