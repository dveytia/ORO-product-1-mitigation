Many are now relying on the deployment of various carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) methods which have been found reliable for reducing CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Various industries are shifting towards the decarbonisation of their operations through the use of a combination of various CCUS activities. This could involve the conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals, the utilization of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), the injection of CO2 into geological formations and/or oceans, the biological fixation of CO2, and other similar activities. Such operations are often referred to as CO2 â€œsinksâ€&#x9d;. It is often crucial for industries to identify which CCUS operations to deploy, especially when faced with many choices, since factors such as the cost of implementation and the sink efficiency play a significant role in the sink selection process. In this work, a mathematical model that helps identify optimal CO2 sink locations within industrial clusters is developed and utilized. Identifying optimal sink locations is an important factor that needs to be considered as part of a CCUS network planning problem. The proposed mathematical model was found to be very useful for identifying optimal CCUS sink selections, and their respective locations. A total of 22.7% of savings in transportation costs have been realized within the network, when compared to the case of having sink locations prescribed upfront.

The largest geological storage potential lies offshore and in the case of basalt, along the mid-oceanic ridges where CO2 could be stored as carbonate minerals for thousands of years. Most of the bedrock, both on land and offshore Iceland consists of basalt that could theoretically be used for injection of CO2, fully dissolved in water. The most feasible formations are the youngest formations located within the active rift zone. It is estimated that up to 7000 GtCO(2) could be stored offshore Iceland within the Exclusive Economic Zone. Site specific geological research and pilot studies are required for refining the concept and offshore pilot scale projects should be considered as the next steps in evolving the method.

All investigations were based on a generic â€œCCS cluster scenarioâ€&#x9d; in which CO2 streams captured from a spatial cluster of eleven emitters (seven fossil-fired power plants, two cement plants, one refinery and one steel mill) are collected in a regional pipeline network. The resulting CO2 stream (19.78 Mio t impure CO2 per year) is transported in a trunk line (onshore and offshore) and injected into five generic replicate storage structures (Buntsandstein saline aquifers) offshore. Experimental investigations and modeling of selected impacts revealed beneficial as well as adverse impacts of different impurities and their combinations. Overall, no fundamental technical obstacles for transporting, injecting and storing CO2 streams of the considered variable compositions and mass flow rates were observed. We recommend to define minimum composition thresholds for each specific CCS project through limiting i) the overall CO2 content, ii) maximum contents of relevant impurities or elements, iii) acceptable variability of concentrations of critical impurities, and defining impurity combinations to be avoided.

Through this study, we have undertaken the most comprehensive assessment to date of the practical equipment costs associated with transporting and storing CO2 captured from power plants in Australia. The implementation of CCS in Australia will require a large transport and storage network involving pipelines, booster pumps, wells, storage site facilities and storage site monitoring. Such a network does not currently exist and needs to be built if CCS is to be deployed at scale. Excluding initial compression, the total plant costs for transport and storage of CO2 from power plant emission hubs in Australia are estimated to vary from as little as \$5-14/t injected for cases with short transport distance and good quality storage sites up to about \$60/t injected for transport of large volumes of CO2 over long distances to lower quality sites. These costs should not be confused with total project costs that include additional owner's costs of at least 15-40\% for proving up storage sites, undertaking the required front end engineering and obtaining project approvals. The total project costs may also require extra risk-adjusted costs. (c) 2017 The Authors.

High CO2 mobility, related to the low density and viscosity of CO2, compared to in-situ fluids can cause viscous fingering, gravity override, and flow in thief zones resulting in poor reservoir sweep efficiency and low oil recoveries. Mobility control foam can improve CO2 EOR and CO2 storage potential by mitigating unfavorable CO2 properties and reducing the impact of reservoir heterogeneity. CO2 foam injection involves injecting a foaming agent (surfactant) with CO2 to generate stable foams in porous media. This work presents an incremental physical upscaling approach that moves from the pore-to core-to fieldscale for characterizing and optimizing foam systems for CO2 mobility control, EOR, and CO2 storage. An additional focus was to visualize and describe in-situ fluid saturation dynamics during CO2 storage processes. We address the challenges associated with transferring CO2 foam EOR technology offshore, using lessons learned from an ongoing onshore pilot in the Permian Basin of west Texas. The aim is to encourage co-optimized CO2 EOR and long-term CO2 storage foam technology as part of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) for offshore applications.

There have been proposed a number of mitigation options, which can be divided into three categories; 1. reduction of energy intensity; 2. reduction of carbon intensity; 3. carbon sequestration. In this review paper, various mitigation options are reviewed focusing on the carbon sequestration options. A reduction in energy intensity is essentially an energy saving. A reduction in carbon intensity could be achieved by switching to energy resources with lower carbon contents. Based on the 2001 IPCC report, the mitigation potential related to energy intensity is estimated at 1,900-2,600 Mt-C/year in 2010, and 3,600-5,050 Mt-C/year in 2020, including other greenhouse gas equivalents. There are additional benefits in implementing these options; they are economically beneficial, and have no associated harmful effects. The carbon sequestration options can be divided into two categories; the enhancement of the natural sinking rates of CO2, and a direct discharge of anthropogenic CO2. The relevant sequestration options in the first category include terrestrial sequestration by vegetation, ocean sequestration by fertilization, and an enhancement of the rock weathering process. In the direct discharge options, the CO2 produced from large point sources, such as thermal power stations, would be captured and separated, then transported and injected either into the ocean or underground. Although the sequestration options are less beneficial in terms of cost per unit CO, reduction compared to other options, technical developments in sequestration options are necessary for the following reasons; 1. A huge potential capacity for carbon sequestration, 2. carbon sequestration enables a continuous use of fossil fuels, which is unavoidable at the moment, before switching to renewable energy sources. Each sequestration option has advantages and disadvantages in terms of capacity, cost, the time scale of the sequestration, the stability of sequestered CO2, and additional environmental impacts, which depend on the location, time, and amount of sequestration. Thus, reliable evaluations of the mitigation efficiency are essential for each sequestration option upon implementation.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1252/jcej.36.361</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210232</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Potential of sub-seafloor CO2 geological storage in northern South China Sea and its importance for CCS development in South China</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The South China, especially Guangdong Province, as the most developed area of China emitted large CO2 from energy consumption and industrial production, actively advocates low-carbon development strategies. As an effective option to reduce CO2 emissions, CCS is potentially an effective option to reduce CO2 emissions to low-carbon economy development of South China, especially to Guangdong province. The CO2 storage potential in sedimentary basins onshore South China is limited as previous indicated. So the potential of sub-seafloor CO2 storage in offshore basins would be important. According to the assessment in this paper, large sedimentary basins offshore in the northern SCS have huge CO2 storage potential. Miocene deltaic, coastal plain, and neritic clastic rocks in these basins contain high-porosity and high-permeability aquifers and excellent seals. The estimated effective storage capacity, which is 2.6\% of the theoretical capacity, is similar to 300 GtCO(2) in PRMB, similar to 57 GtCO(2) in BBGB, similar to 41Gt CO2 in QDNB and similar to 160Gt CO2 in YGHB. On the whole, the Tertiary sedimentary basins in northern SCS margin have large storage capacities of abut 567Gt CO2, which provide a promising storage option for CCS implementation in South China. As the high costs is a major obstacles for sub-seafloor CO2 storage, the reuse of infrastructures for oil and gas development, such as platforms, wells and pipelines, would be the first choice. Although the theoretical storage capacities of the offshore oil and gas fields in the northern SCS are small, they distributed as groups and clusters and associated with sufficient quantified CO2 storage capacity in the saline aquifers. Further assessments are needed to define the residual life (= equipment life minus the field life) of the infrastructures, their practical and matched storage capacities, as well as a proper character and site screening particularly in regard to containment and risk of leakage. All these have been done well ahead of the real abandons of the oil/gas fields, so that the fields are in ``CO2 Storage Readiness (CSR){''}. (c) 2013 The Authors.

Although great attention is given to technologies of capture, the ability to store immense tonnages of carbon stock for geologically long time periods, isolated from atmosphere and ocean interaction, is equally important. In this chapter, the multiple storage locations for carbon stocking on and below land, also within and below the ocean, are evaluated. The evaluation shows that carbon dioxide reduction (CDR) is useful for mitigation, but cannot balance the rate of new emissions from fossil fuel exploitation. Many CDR methods have large uncertainty in their quantity, life-cycle, global impact and engineered feasibility. Competition for biomass and land usage is inevitable. Pathways and reservoirs of carbon in the ocean are complex and interlocked. Engineered storage of carbon will also be expensive, resource intensive and cannot substitute for a greatly reduced usage of fossil carbon. Human industrial and economic activity must ``move beyond hydrocarbons{''} to be sustainable beyond 2050.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210313</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The second phase of Japanese R\&amp;D program for CO2 ocean sequestration</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The ``Moving-ship{''} scheme technically offers the maximum dilution of injected liquid CO2. Captured and liquefied at the plant on land, CO2 is delivered by ship and injected into ocean depths of 1000 to 2500 in with a suspended and towed pipe by a slowly moving ship. For a realistic scale, the CO2 discharge rate is 100kg/sec, towing speed is 3m/sec, the width of the wake of the pipe is 2m; the initial dilution ratio becomes about 1/60,000 prior to full droplet dissolution at 1,000m. The 5-year R\&amp;D program (Phase-2) includes the verification of the dilution scheme of the above-mentioned concept by the ocean experiment. At the same time, based on the actual biological survey in the same site, the assessment of environmental impact for the hypothetical full-scale implementation will be conducted; the lethal CO2 concentration limit value will be identified for the mid-depth plankton of the site by the method developed in the first phase (from 1997 to 2002) of the NEDO R\&amp;D program, and will then used in the food-web based assessment model of the site. The opportunity of the ocean experiment is open to the international partners, and the verified dilution factor attainable by moving-ship concept coupled with the established assessment methodology will be submitted to the international forum in order to obtain the legal acceptance of this technology as a measure of CO2 emission reduction. The Phase 2 was started in April this year, however, the experimental plan of the CO2 injection into the ocean will be revised because the permission for the experiment in Norway was withdrawn by the ministry of the environment last August.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210326</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Measurement of clathrate-hydrate film thickness formed at the interface between liquid CO2 and water</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Liquid CO2 dissolution observed at CO2 sequestration in the ocean, CO2 mitigation strategy, is accompanied by CO2 clathrate-hydrate film, which has a large effect on the estimation of the strategy. Therefore, the mechanism of CO2 dissolution with hydrate film is a point of special interest. From this viewpoint, the present paper presents a new technique to measuring the thickness of the hydrate film formed at the interface between liquid CO2 and water. The technique is based on the dissolution model of liquid CO2 with hydrate film whose unique thickness is maintained by the dissolution at the water side and formation at the liquid CO2 side in the process of CO2 dissolution, if the hydrate is not formed at the liquid CO2 side, only the dissolution occurs and its characteristics is applied to the measurement of the thickness of hydrate film. Using a high pressure experiment apparatus, a water droplet was injected into the liquid CO2 to attach the hydrate film, The water droplet has an effect to stop the hydrate formation. After 2.1 s, the hydrate film disappeared at the contact point. The hydrate thickness was estimated to be about 0.43 mu m using these data. it was confirmed that the experimental results also have supported the dissolution model.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/B978-008043018-8/50050-3</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210350</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Evasion of CO2 injected into the ocean in the context of CO2 stabilization</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The eventual evasion of injected CO2 to the atmosphere is one consideration when assessing deep sea disposal Of CO2 as a potential response option to climate change concerns. Evasion estimated using an ocean carbon cycle model is compared to long-term trajectories for future CO2 emissions, including illustrative cases leading to stabilization of CO2 concentration at various levels. Modeled residence time for CO2 injected into the deep ocean exceeds the 100-year time scale usually considered in scenarios for future emissions, and the potential impacts of climate change. Illustrative cases leading monotonically to constant CO2 concentration have been highlighted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to give guidance on possible timing of emission reductions that may be required to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations at various levels. For stabilization cases considered, significant modeled evasion does not occur until long after CO2 emissions have reached a maximum and begun to decline. Illustrative cases can also lead to a maximum in CO2 concentration followed by a decline to slowly decreasing concentrations. In such cases, future injection of emissions into the deep ocean leads to lower maximum CO2 concentration, with less effect on concentration later on in time.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210356</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Studies of Co2 hydrate formation and dissolution</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Sequestering waste CO2 in the deep ocean as a gas, liquid, or hydrate has been variously proposed (1-3).

In the present work, recent progress made in electrochemical CO2 capture is reviewed. The majority of these methods rely on the concept of ``pH-swing{''} and the effect it has on the CO2 hydration/dehydration equilibrium. Through a pH-swing, CO2 can be captured and recovered by shifting the pH of a working fluid between acidic and basic pH. Such swing can be applied electrochemically through electrolysis, bipolar membrane electrodialysis, reversible redox reactions and capacitive deionization. In this review, we summarize main parameters governing these electrochemical pH-swing processes and put the concept in the framework of available worldwide capture technologies. We analyse the energy efficiency and consumption of such systems, and provide recommendations for further improvements. Although electrochemical CO2 capture technologies are rather costly compared to the amine based capture, they can be particularly interesting if more affordable renewable electricity and materials (e.g., electrode and membranes) become widely available. Furthermore, electrochemical methods have the ability to (directly) convert the captured CO2 to value added chemicals and fuels, and hence prepare for a fully electrified circular carbon economy.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1039/d0ee03382k</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210379</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Environmental impacts of carbon dioxide disposal</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Impact assessments for CO2-disposal techniques face significant environmental uncertainties.

In particular, CCS technologies are still presented as a solution to reach ambitious climate targets. However, avoiding the required Gt of CO2 emissions by investing in CCS technologies supposes the development of carbon storage capacities. This analysis, conducted with TIAM-FR and based on a wide review of geological storage potential and various data, aims to discuss the impact of this potential on the development of the CCS option. We also specify a scenario allowing the exclusion of onshore storage due to a hypothetic policy considering public resistance to onshore storage, and carbon transport costs variation effects. The implementation of CCS is less impacted by the level of carbon storage potential - except in the lowest case of availability - than by the type of sequestration site. However, the development of CCS is lower at the end of the period in the case of a decrease in carbon storage potential. Indeed, the question of type of storage site appears to have a greater impact, with an arbitrage between deep saline aquifers and depleted basins and enhanced recovery. Doubling the cost of carbon transport does not limit the penetration of carbon capture technologies, but it does impact the choice of site. Finally, a limitation of onshore storage could have a significant impact on the penetration of the CCS option. The explanation for this limited deployment of CCS is thus the higher cost of offshore storage more than the level of storage potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditionally, CCS projects targeted mostly high permeability sandstone formations, despite the numerous carbonate fields undergoing CO2 injection for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in the United States or Canada. Because of the reactivity between calcite minerals and CO2 saturated water, chalk formations, characterized by high porosity and low permeability, have been previously portrayed as infeasible CO2 storage sites. Although previous laboratory investigations were carried out to assess the performance of CO2EOR in North Sea chalk fields, these studies did not result in any field-scale demonstration projects; this may soon change since a positive movement towards CO2 storage in depleted oil fields has been recently initiated. In this work, we reviewed existing studies on CO2 injection in chalk to address the suitability of this type of formation for CCS. Although the evidence on the thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical behaviour of chalk in the presence of CO2-saturated aqueous solutions is mixed, the majority of flooding tests performed on reservoir core samples do not support further weakening relative to water injection conditions nor significant changes in the petrophysical properties. Along with the weakening effect and using the Danish North Sea chalk fields as a case study, we addressed events that impact the storage site safety such as fault reactivation, and caprock and well integrity. Furthermore, monitoring techniques relevant to offshore locations are also discussed. Based on studies on other types of carbonates, and considering the characteristics of chalk (e.g., permeability, wettability, and reactivity) we analysed the relevance of different trapping mechanisms (i.e., solution, capillary, and mineral) but also several effects (i.e., chemical, biological, mechanical) that can lead to loss of injectivity. The main observations and conclusions in this work can be easily extrapolated to other chalk formations worldwide.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.earscirev.2021.103826</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210452</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Recovery of CH4from natural gas hydrates using the mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">On the continental margins and in permafrost regions, natural gas such as methane, ethane, propane and large hydrocarbons, which has been expected to replace petroleum energy, exists in solid hydrate form. Because of huge amounts of natural gas in the solid form of Natural Gas Hydrate (NGH), the effective recovery of natural gas from NGH becomes the most important factor on evaluating the economic feasibility in the sense of commercialization. If NGHs could be transformed into CO2 hydrates, they would suggest double opportunities as energy sources and global warming gas storage sites. Herein, we report the Dual CO2 sequestration and CH4 recovery phenomena occurring in NGH layers including sI, sII and sH. For sI CH 4 hydrate, the resulting outcome of 64% and 85% CH4 recovery rate achieved by the direct use of CO2 and N 2/CO2 mixtures (8:2) was reported by using Gas Chromatography (GC). In the case of sII and sH CH4 hydrates, we report dual structure transition to si during swapping phenomena and a cage-specific distribution of guest molecules. A significant change of structure transition due to CO2s attack induces the considerable increase of CH4 recovery rate.

Therefore, CO2 storage in saline aquifers can be expected to become an important element of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) systems. CO2 storage in saline aquifers is studied in the European DYNAMIS project, where special attention was paid to the relation between the geological structure, geological properties and achievable injection rates. This paper presents the results from simulations of CO2 storage in two aquifer structures. One aquifer structure is located in the English sector of the Southern North Sea and one aquifer structure located in Northern Germany. The geological model of the Southern North Sea structure was built using existing knowledge of facies geometry and distribution from literature and well logs and the overall geometry from interpreted horizons. The distributions of properties like lithology, net-to-gross ratios, porosity and permeability were stochastically modelled to represent the braided and meandering river and fan systems within the Bunter Sandstone Formation. High-porosity and high-permeability zones model fluvial channels running through the reservoir. A different approach was chosen for the North German structure. Because there is no information on the facies or petrophysical parameter distribution of the aquifer, three different model scenarios were generated. One model was created with homogeneous properties throughout the aquifer. Two other model scenarios were generated allowing the porosity and permeability to vary within certain ranges. This was done using a sequential Gaussian simulation with the known mean, minimum and maximum values of porosity and permeability, respectively. Due to the size of the aquifer structures and computing limits, up-scaling of the geological model of the Southern North Sea was required. The up-scaling was aimed to retain as much as possible of the modelled geological features such as braided river and fan systems. Several reservoir simulations were carried out in collaboration between TNO and IFP to assess CO2 injection. Given the injection rate constraints, the aim of the injection simulations was to: assess the achievable rate of injection; study the migration and behavior of the CO2 in the reservoir; assess the most appropriate location(s) for the CO2 injection wells using alternate injection strategies. The injection strategy is relevant especially for the Southern North Sea structure, where river and fan systems may results in high-permeability zones through the reservoir. Accessing such systems may significantly improve a reservoir's value for CO2 storage. The effect of such systems on the injection rates is demonstrated. The reservoir simulations also demonstrate the injection rates that can be achieved in tight reservoirs as in the North Germany case, and the effect of spatial variability of geological parameters. This will show whether it is reasonable to assume spatial geological homogeneity, when data on the reservoir formation are scarce. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, large amounts of CO2 are emitted to the atmosphere, throwing the carbon cycle out of balance. Currently, the most effective method to reduce the CO2 concentration is direct CO2 capture from the atmosphere and pumping of the captured CO2 deep underground or into the mid-ocean. The transformation of CO2 into high-value chemicals is an attractive yet challenging task. In recent years, there has been much interest in the development of CO2 utilization technologies based on electrochemical CO2 reduction, photochemical CO2 reduction, and thermal CO2 reduction, and CO2 valorization has emerged as a hot research topic. In electrochemical CO2 reduction, the cathodic reaction is the reduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals. The anodic reaction should be the oxygen evolution reaction, and water is the only renewable and scalable source of electrons and protons in this reaction. There is a plethora of research on the use of various metals to catalyze this reaction. Among these, Cu-based materials have been demonstrated to show unique catalytic activity and stability for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to valuable fuels and chemicals. Moreover, the solar-driven conversion of CO2 into value-added chemical fuels has attracted great attention, and much effort is being devoted to develop novel catalysts for the photoreduction of CO2, especially by mimicking the natural photosynthetic process. The key step in the photocatalytic process is the efficient generation of electron-hole pairs and separation of these charge carriers. The efficient separation of photoinduced charge carriers plays a crucial role in the final catalytic activity. Compared with CO2 reduction via electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, thermal reduction is more attractive because of its potential large-scale application in the industry. Heterogeneous nanomaterials show excellent activity in the electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and thermal catalytic conversion of CO2. However, nanostructured materials have drawbacks on the investigation of the intrinsic activity of the active sites. In recent years, single-site catalysts have become popular because they allow for maximum utilization of the metal centers, show specific catalytic performance, and facilitate easy elucidation of the catalytic mechanism at the molecular level. Accordingly, numerous single-site catalysts were developed for CO2 reduction to produce value-added chemicals such as CO, CH4, CH3OH, formate, and C2+ products. Value-added chemicals have also been synthesized with the aid of amines and epoxides. This review summarizes recent state-of-the-art single-site catalysts and their application as heterogeneous catalysts for the electroreduction, photoreduction, and thermal reduction of CO2. In the discussion, we will highlight the structure-activity relationships for the catalytic conversion of CO2 with single-site catalysts.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3866/PKU.WHXB202006080</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210481</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">News.

There were over 800 presentations and over 250 exhibitors. The emphasis on carbon dioxide related to how it is to be stored in Norway, USA, Canada, Australia, and France. In Norway, the first industrial scale use of trapping carbon dioxide has been underway since 1996 in the Sleipner offshore field in the North Sea where 1 million ton of carbon dioxide are captured and injected into a saline aquifer (Utsira). About a dozen sequestration projects in the USA are discussed. In Texas, 274 power plants produce 200 million ton of carbon dioxide or 55% of the total emitted in the state. Three aquifer sites at depths of 4500 ft have been identified for the power plants of Gibbons Creek, Sam K. Seymour, and Martin Lake that emit 3.5, 12.2, and 18.4 million ton of carbon dioxide. Several states (Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, and Ohio) have created the MIDCARD (Midcontinent Interactive Digital Carbon Atlas and Regional Database) consortium that has built the Relation Database Management System and GIS to itemize the main sources of carbon dioxide and possibilities of geologic sequestration on their territory. In Kentucky, marls seem to offer an initial possibility for sequestration but they are not yet tested. In Kansas, a project brings together co-generation, ethanol production, and assisted oil recovery with carbon dioxide. In another project carbon dioxide is sent to coal layers where methane is freed and carbon dioxide accumulates. Another project involves capture of carbon dioxide by lime. The Teapot Dome in Wyoming has been chosen for a sequestration test. In Alabama, samples have been analyzed in the Black Warrior basin to determine absorption isotherms of carbon dioxide and methane. In tho state of Washington, the mineralization of carbon dioxide is obtained in basalt formations. A map of methane gas fields absorbed in coal has been drawn for the USA in active and abandoned mines. The physics of coal and interactions between carbon dioxide and methane are under study. In Nova Scotia the levels of coal indicate the possibility to sequester carbon dioxide with the extraction of methane. In Australia, site research is ongoing with the GEODISC program. In France, IFP studies the evolution of carbon dioxide injected into aquifers or fields depleted of hydrocarbons.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210509</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Assessment of CO2 Injectivity During Sequestration in Depleted Gas Reservoirs</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Depleted gas reservoirs are appealing targets for carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration because of their storage capacity, proven seal, reservoir characterization knowledge, existing infrastructure, and potential for enhanced gas recovery. Low abandonment pressure in the reservoir provides additional voidage-replacement potential for CO2 and allows for a low surface pump pressure during the early period of injection. However, the injection process poses several challenges. This work aims to raise awareness of key operational challenges related to CO2 injection in low-pressure reservoirs and to provide a new approach to assessing the phase behavior of CO2 within the wellbore. When the reservoir pressure is below the CO2 bubble-point pressure, and CO2 is injected in its liquid or supercritical state, CO2 will vaporize and expand within the well-tubing or in the near-wellbore region of the reservoir. This phenomenon is associated with several flow assurance problems. For instance, when CO2 transitions from the dense-state to the gas-state, CO2 density drops sharply, affecting the wellhead pressure control and the pressure response at the well bottom-hole. As CO2 expands with a lower phase viscosity, the flow velocity increases abruptly, possibly causing erosion and cavitation in the flowlines. Furthermore, CO2 expansion is associated with the Joule-Thomson (IJ) effect, which may result in dry ice or hydrate formation and therefore may reduce CO2 injectivity. Understanding the transient multiphase phase flow behavior of CO2 within the wellbore is crucial for appropriate well design and operational risk assessment. The commonly used approach analyzes the flow in the wellbore without taking into consideration the transient pressure response of the reservoir, which predicts an unrealistic pressure gap at the wellhead. This pressure gap is related to the phase transition of CO2 from its dense state to the gas state. In this work, a new coupled approach is introduced to address the phase behavior of CO2 within the wellbore under different operational conditions. The proposed approach integrates the flow within both the wellbore and the reservoir at the transient state and therefore resolves the pressure gap issue. Finally, the energy costs associated with a mitigation process that involves CO2 heating at the wellhead are assessed.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/geosciences9050199</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210552</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Viability of greenhouse gas removal via artificial addition of volcanic ash to the ocean</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Mitigating human contributions to climate change is a highly debated topic, as it becomes evident that many nations do not adhere to optional reductions in global emission. Substantial research is taking place into negative carbon technologies that actively reduce the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) via greenhouse gas removal (GGR). Various GGR methods have been proposed, from reforestation to ocean fertilisation. This article discusses advantages of an approach based on enhanced input of tephra to the ocean, to increase the drawdown of atmospheric CO2. Natural addition of tephra to the ocean results in preservation of enhanced organic matter in sediment. Hence, augmenting its delivery should raise the level of sequestration. Calculations indicate that offshore tephra addition could sequester 2750 tonnes of CO2 per 50,000 tonnes of ash delivered (a typical bulk carrier's capacity). The cost is estimated as similar to\$55 per tonne of CO2 sequestered and is an order of magnitude cheaper than many proposed GGR technologies. Further advantages include: tephra addition is simply an augmentation of a natural Earth process, it is a low technology approach that requires few developments, and it may sequester carbon for thousands of years. Hence, offshore tephra addition warrants further investigation to assess its viability. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The additions of carbon-rich substrates in degraded coastal wetlands have been documented to alleviate this situation; however, the microbial responses as well as their carbon metabolisms to the input are not well explored. Here, we investigated the effects of different addition levels (0.1\%, 1\%, and 3\%) of reed straw and biochar addition on microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) and predicted functions of carbon metabolism in degraded coastal salt marshes. The effects of the carbon-rich substrates on microbial communities are more pronounced under 3\% of reed straw and biochar than other levels, straw increased opportunistic bacteria (e.g., Bacillus and Cellvibrionaceae) and biochar increased low carbon turnover bacteria (e. g., Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria). The addition of higher doses of reed straw and biochar promoted the carbon metabolism of soil bacteria as predicted by the PICRUSt 2. Interestingly, the addition of reed straw increased the abundance involved in fungal carbon metabolism, but this was not the case for the biochar input. The addition of reed straw and biochar promoted the growth of some bacteria (e.g., Rhizobiales and Bacillus) that are beneficial to plant growth, and decreased some fungal pathogen (e.g., Magnaporthaceae and Phaeosphaeria). Our findings revealed that the carbon-rich substrates addition can reshape the microbial structure and shift their carbon metabolisms, specially, biochar has a higher potential to improve the ecosystem services, such as blue carbon sequestration, of these degraded coastal salt marshes.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.129898</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210624</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Hydrochars produced by hydrothermal carbonisation of seaweed, coconut shell and oak: effect of processing temperature on physicochemical adsorbent characteristics</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The present study addresses the production of hydrochars from brown seaweed (Fucus serratus) (FS-HCs), coconut shell (CS-HCs), and oak (Oak-HCs) as potential adsorbents using hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC). The effect of HTC processing temperature on the physicochemical adsorbent characteristics of the hydrochars is investigated at different temperatures (200, 220, 250 degrees C) using a hydrothermal batch reactor. Increasing HTC temperature causes the formation of many spheres in CS-HCs and Oak-HCs, increasing their porosity, except FS-HCs. The surface area of the hydrochars increases with increasing HTC temperature; 10.93-12.78 m(2)/g for FS-HCs, 2.18-21.94 m(2)/g for CS-HCs, except for Oak-HCs which decreases from 4.89 to 3.09 m(2)/g. Increasing HTC temperature decreases volatile matter content in the hydrochars, increases fixed carbon content, and decreases H/C ratio (except for FS-HCs) and O/C ratio of the hydrochars. For all the hydrochars, increasing the HTC temperature results in a slight decrease in zeta potential magnitude, with negatively charged surfaces, making them potential adsorbents for cationic pollutants. The study confirms that the HTC process improves key chemical and physical characteristics of the hydrochars compared to the original biomass, and that the physicochemical adsorbent characteristics are enhanced as the processing temperature increases.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s42452-022-05085-x</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210627</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Tomakomai CCS Demonstration Project of Japan, CO2 Injection in Process</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The Tomakomai CCS demonstration project is currently being undertaken by the Japanese government in Tomakomai City, Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan.

Consequently, modelling of CO2 injection requires the selection of the most appropriate constitutive material model for the best possible representation of the material response. The authors focus on modelling the geomechanical behaviour of the reservoir material, coupled with a multiphase flow solution of CO2 injection into a saline-saturated medium. It is proposed that the SR3 critical-state material model is used, which considers a direct link between strengthâ€“volumeâ€“permeability that evolves during the simulation; furthermore, the material is considered to yield prior to reaching a peak strength in agreement with experimental observations. Verification of the material model against established laboratory tests is conducted, including multiphase flow accounting for relative permeabilities and fluid densities. Multiphase flow coupled to advanced geomechanics provides a holistic approach to modelling CO2 injection into sandstone reservoirs. The resulting injection pressures, CO2 migration extent and patterns, formation dilation, and strength reduction are compared for a range of in situ porosities and incremental material enhancements. This work aims to demonstrate a numerical modelling framework to aid in the understanding of geomechanical responses to CO2 injection for safe and efficient deployment, and is particularly applicable to CO2 sequestration in less favourable aquifers with a relatively low permeability, receiving CO2 from a limited number of injection wells at high flow rates. The proposed framework can also enable additional features to be incorporated into the model such as faults and detailed overburden representation.

This study aims to investigate the feasibility of a net-zero carbon roadmap for the petrochemical industry by 1) developing an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based generative model to produce stochastic scenarios for offshore wind power in an elec-trical grid, and 2) conducting techno-economic and environmental assessments for forecasting models that define offshore wind power networks. Firstly, data processing techniques were utilized on remotely sensed offshore wind speed datasets and energy data obtained from petrochemical industrial parks. Second, a generative model was designed using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to produce different forecast scenarios of offshore wind power. Third, stochastic scenarios were developed by considering behavioral characteristics of offshore wind power with stochastic scenario uncertainties. Finally, we investigated the techno-economic and environmental assessments of the proposed renewable energy networks. Comparing to the case of offshore wind power in 2022, The proposed XAI-driven net-zero carbon roadmap indicated that the total cost of electricity generation and fossil fuel cost with carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be reduced by 4\% and 42\% with 41\% reduction of CO2 emission. Ultimately, this may be implemented in industrial parks to aid in efforts towards carbon neutrality.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134793</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210671</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Characterization of shallow seal complexes for CO2 storage sites - Example from the greater sleipner area</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Building on the successful Sleipner CO2 storage project in the Norwegian North Sea, the Utsira Formation has been proposed as large-scale CO2 storage reservoir.

Compared with terrestrial ecosystems, coastal vegetation shows higher rates of atmospheric CO2 uptake and a more efficient retention of carbon (C) in sediments. Salt marshes present the highest values as C binders, although a global estimation of these values is still pending due to regional gaps in the records predominantly from the southern hemisphere. There are no clear patterns or dominant processes with enough evidence to account for the observed variability, suggesting that context dependent processes are likely greatest influencers on C storage. Salt marshes in the South West Atlantic (SWA) coast are densely populated by the intertidal burrowing and herbivore crab Neohelice (=Chasmagnathus) granulata. Many ecological processes related to C transformation occurring in these salt marshes are influenced by crab activities, either through bioturbation or via herbivory. We hypothesize that N. granulata could have a significant role in the capacity of SWA salt marshes to bind C. Reduction of plant biomass, increased aerobic decomposition in the sediment and facilitation of erosion are some of the multiple effects exerted by N. granulata that can directly and indirectly modify the capacity of salt marshes to bind C. Here, we compiled information available regarding C sequestration and accumulation in SWA coastal salt marshes and propose a hypothetical model including the mechanisms mediated by N. granulata that interfere the transformation paths of C in salt marshes. The data suggest that mechanisms that are top-down regulated, negatively affect C accumulation in the form of aboveground biomass especially in salt marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora. While, mechanisms mediated by bioturbation can negatively (increasing oxygenation and thus facilitating aerobic degradation) affect as well as positively (increasing retention of macrodetritus) affect the accumulation of C, the latter being of greater magnitude in Spartina densiflora salt marshes.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3389/fmars.2016.00122</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210700</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Carbon capture and sequestration: The U.S. Department of Energy's R&amp;D efforts to characterize opportunities for deep geologic storage of carbon dioxide in offshore resources</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The Carbon Sequestration Program being implemented by the DOE's Office of Fossil Energy and managed by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is helping to develop technologies to capture, separate, and store CO2 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without adversely affecting energy use or hindering economic growth.

The Sleipner storage site, offshore Norway, is the world's first and largest engineered waste repository for a greenhouse gas. CO2 is separated from the Sleipner gas condensate field and stored in the pore space of the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer approximately 1 km below the surface and 200 km from the coast. Statoil, the field operator, has injected almost 1 Mt/yr of captured CO2 into the storage site since 1996. The buoyant CO2 plume ascended rapidly through eight thin shale barriers within the aquifer to reach the top seal in less than three years. The plume's progress has been monitored by eight seismic surveys, as well as gravimetric and electromagnetic monitoring, which record the spreading of nine thin CO2 layers. This paper presents a capillary flow model using invasion percolation physics that accurately matches the plume's geometry. The approach differs from standard Darcy flow simulations, which fail to match the plume geometry. The calibrated capillary flow simulation indicates that a mass balance for the plume is likely, but can only replicate the plume geometry if the thin intra-formational shale barriers are fractured. The model enables an estimate of the shale barrier behavior and caprock performance. The fractures are very unlikely to have been caused by CO2 injection given the confining stress of the rock and weak overpressure of the plume, and so fracturing must pre-date injection. A novel mechanism is suggested: the deglaciation of regional ice sheets that have rapidly and repeatedly unloaded approximately 1 km of ice. The induced transient pore pressures are sufficient to hydro-fracture thin shales. The fractures enable fast CO2 ascent, resulting in a multi-layered plume. Shallow CO2 storage sites in the Northern North Sea and other regions that have been loaded by Quaternary ice sheets are likely to behave in a similar manner. (C) 2014 The Authors.

It is clear that we need to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from our atmosphere if we want to avoid greatly increased risk of damage from climate change. Aggressively pursuing a program of emissions abatement or mitigation will show results over a timescale of many decades. How do we actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make a bigger difference more quickly? As one of a two-book report, this volume of Climate Intervention discusses CDR, the carbon dioxide removal of greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere and sequestration of it in perpetuity. Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration introduces possible CDR approaches and then discusses them in depth. Land management practices, such as low-till agriculture, reforestation and afforestation, ocean iron fertilization, and land-and-ocean-based accelerated weathering, could amplify the rates of processes that are already occurring as part of the natural carbon cycle. Other CDR approaches, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration, direct air capture and sequestration, and traditional carbon capture and sequestration, seek to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and dispose of it by pumping it underground at high pressure. This book looks at the pros and cons of these options and estimates possible rates of removal and total amounts that might be removed via these methods. With whatever portfolio of technologies the transition is achieved, eliminating the carbon dioxide emissions from the global energy and transportation systems will pose an enormous technical, economic, and social challenge that will likely take decades of concerted effort to achieve. Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration will help to better understand the potential cost and performance of CDR strategies to inform debate and decision making as we work to stabilize and reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.

The transportation of CO2 is required since storage sites are not necessarily present near the source sites. Ships can be used for long distance transport of CO2. However, CO2 sources are not always located near the coast; hence onshore transportation may be required in addition to ship for transportation of CO2 from source sites to storage site. Liquefaction is a vital component in ship transportation. In this study, a state-of-the-art CO2 liquefaction processes have been designed by taking CO2 capture facilities into account. The proposed processes require lower liquefaction energy compared to other processes found in the literature. Suitable thermodynamic conditions are required for economical transport of CO2. Therefore, three scenarios each for post-combustion and pre-combustion have been studied in order to explore the effect of thermodynamic conditions on the economics of CO2 transport. The considered scenarios are categorized on the basis of liquefaction plant location as: (i) the capture site, liquefaction plant and shipping terminal are located close to each other; (ii) the capture site and liquefaction plant are far from shipping terminal; (iii) the capture site is far from liquefaction plant and shipping terminal. The scenarios results were useful for deciding the optimum liquefaction plant location. Finally, an economic analysis is performed in order to evaluate the feasibility of CO2 transport from source sites to ship loading terminal.

These are to interface with existing industrial infrastructure and, in some cases, tap into the carbon sink potential of nature.

In this study, a new approach for the management of desalination reject brine and capture of CO2, where ammoniated brine is reacted with carbon dioxide, has been investigated. The effects of reaction temperature, reaction time, and excess ammonia were assessed. Carbon dioxide was used either as a pure gas or a mixture of 10% CO2 in methane. The experimental results indicated that the optimum reaction temperature was about 20 Â°C and the optimum NH3/NaCl ratio was 2 for synthetic brine solutions and 3 for actual reject brine. The proposed process proved to be effective in reducing the CO2 concentration in a CO2-CH4 gas mixture by more than 90%. The solubility of sodium bicarbonate was found to play a key role in the removal of sodium. The results indicated that the new approach can reduce the salinity of reject brine and, at the same time, contribute to the reduction CO2 emissions.

In this process, CO2 is captured and injected into geological formations for permanent storage. The injected plume and its migration within the reservoir is carefully monitored, using geophysical methods. While it is considered unlikely that the injected CO2 should escape the reservoir and reach the marine environment, marine monitoring is required to verify that there are no indications of leakage, and to detect and quantify leakage if it should occur. Marine monitoring is challenging because of the considerable area to be covered, the limited spatial and temporal extent of a potential leakage event, and the considerable natural variability in the marine environment. In this review, we summarize marine monitoring strategies developed to ensure adequate monitoring of the marine environment without introducing prohibitive costs. We also provide an overview of the many different technologies applicable to different aspects of marine monitoring of geologically stored carbon.

The risk analysis consists of several elements such as leakage probability, assessing the strength of environmental perturbation, and quantifying the ecological, economic, and social impacts. Here, the environmental perturbation aspect is addressed by using a marine system model of the North West European Shelf seas to simulate the consequences of CO2 additions such as those that could arise from a failure of geological sequestration schemes. Little information exists to guide the choice of leak scenario and many assumptions are required; for consistency the assumptions err towards greater impact and what would be in likelihood extreme scenarios. The simulations indicate that only the largest leakage scenarios tested are capable of producing perturbations that are likely to have environmental consequences beyond the locality of a leak event. It is shown that, given the available evidence, the chemical perturbation of a sequestration leak, regionally integrated, is likely to be insignificant when compared with that from continued non-mitigated atmospheric CO2 emissions and the subsequent acidification of the marine system. The potential ecological impacts of a large environmental CO 2 perturbation are reviewed, indicating that the biogeochemical functioning and biodiversity are sensitive. The key unknowns that must be addressed in future research are identified; namely, the fine scale dispersion of CO2 and the ability of ecological systems to recover from perturbation.

Limestone and shells were used as the calcium-based raw materials, with sea salt as dopant. Modified limestone had the highest CO2-capture capacity after multiple carbonation-calcination cycles.

Here, we use repeated high-resolution seismic reflection surveys acquired using a chirp profiler mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), to image CO2 gas released into shallow sub-surface sediments above a potential CCS storage site at 120 m water depth in the North Sea. Observations of temporal changes in seismic reflectivity, attenuation, unit thickness and the bulk permeability of sediment were used to develop a four-stage model of the evolution of gas migration in shallow marine sediments: Proto-migration, Immature Migration, Mature Migration, and Pathway Closure. Bubble flow was initially enabled through the propagation of stable fractures but, over time, transitioned to dynamic fractures with an associated step change in permeability. Once the gas injection rate exceeded the rate at which gas could escape the coarser sediments overlying the injection point, gas began to pool along a grain size boundary. This enhanced understanding of the migration of free gas in near-surface sediments will help improve methods of detection and quantification of gas in subsurface marine sediments.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103363</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96212088</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Metal fractionation in marine sediments acidified by enrichment of CO2: A risk assessment</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Carbon-capture and storage is considered to be a potential mitigation option for climate change.

Laboratory experiments were performed to provide data on the effects of CO2-related acidification on the chemical fractionation of metal(loid)s in marine-contaminated sediments using sequential extraction procedures. The results showed that sediments from Huelva estuary registered concentrations of arsenic, copper, lead, and zinc that surpass the probable biological effect level established by international protocols. Zinc had the greatest proportion in the most mobile fraction of the sediment. Metals in this fraction represent an environmental risk because they are weakly bound to sediment, and therefore more likely to migrate to the water column. Indeed, the concentration of this metal was lower in the most acidified scenarios when compared to control pH, indicating probable zinc mobilization from the sediment to the seawater.

Working on behalf of Yorkshire Forward, Amec has studied the infrastructure network needed to connect local industrial emitters to suitable CO2 storage sites in the North Sea. According to Amec's project director Alastair Rennie, this would cost around $3.95 billion, which would cover the infrastructure needed to compress and transport the gas, but not the cost of capturing the gas or the technology at the wellhead. The plan sees a number of companies developing the infrastructure in stages. The Yorkshire and Humber area is ideally suited as a first project of this kind, because it has both a relatively small number of large-scale CO2 emitters, including the Drax, Eggborough, and Ferrybridge, and a large number of mature gas fields nearby with a well-understood, stable geology, ideal for carbon storage. Many of these are expected to be depleted between 2012 and 2030. Amec's calculations assume that only 25% of the CO2 emitted in the area would ultimately be abated, that is the amount captured minus the emissions associated with the process of gas capture and transportation. Even so, the contribution would be very noticeable, amounting to around 35.6 million ton/yr by 2030, or 6.4% of the country's total CO2 emissions in 2005. At best, Rennie calculates that the Yorkshire and Humber region could abate 46.3 million ton/yr of carbon by 2040.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210614</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Simulation experiment of CO2 storage at 3600m deep ocean floor</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) conducted an in situ CO2 storage experiment at the 3627 meters deep ocean floor in the Monterey Canyon in 1998 and observed the phenomenon that liquid CO2 once a beaker on the ocean floor is half-filled intermittently overflows. The SRI conducted several land-based experiments in 1999 to confirm this newly observed phenomenon that could be expected to have a large influence on the feasibility assessment of storage type CO2 sequestration in the ocean. These experiments identified the key factor causing such intermittent overflow. A channel penetrating liquid CO2 in the beaker supplies enough water molecules to cause rapid hydrate growth which can displaces up wards the overlying liquid CO2. A mechanistic model to explain this rapid hydrate growth was proposed. On the other hand, in the absence of any water channels a mass of liquid CO2 covered with hydrate membrane was observed to survive in a beaker for longer than 100 days. In the real CO2 storage site, the water channels formed between large CO2 droplets will be crushed up by the head pressure due to the density difference between liquid CO2 and seawater.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210680</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">MONITORING CO2 PLUMES WITH MINI STREAMERS, IS THERE POTENTIAL?</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Monitoring is an essential element in CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS) technology to prove conformance and containment of the stored CO2.

Synthetic brine reconstruction by means of 0D geochemical models; 4. Numerical geochemical modelling at different complexity levels. Field rocks chosen for CO2 injection have been experimentally characterized, showing a high content of Fe in clayey, micaceous and carbonate mineralogical phases. New-defined, site-specific minerals have been characterized, starting from real XRD, XRF and SEM-EDX data and by calculation of their thermochemical parameters with a proprietary procedure. They are used to reconstruct synthetic formation water chemical composition (at equilibrium with both rock mineralogy and gas phase), subsequently used in RTM. CO2 injection is simulated using 2D radial reactive transport model(s) built in a commercial compositional reservoir simulator. The simulations follow a step-increase in the complexity of the model by adding CO2 solubility, water vaporization and geochemical reactions. Geochemical processes impact on CO2 storage capacity and injectivity is quantitatively analyzed. The results show that neglecting the CO2 solubility in formation water may underestimate the max CO2 storage capacity in H field by around 1%, maintaining the same pressure build-up profile. Sensitivities on the impact of formation water salinity on the CO2 solubility are presented. In a one thousand years' timescale, changes in reservoir porosity due to mineral alteration, triggered by CO2-brine-rock interactions, seem to be minimal in the near wellbore and far field. However, it has been seen that water vaporization with the associated halite precipitation inclusion in the simulation models is recommended, especially at high-level of formation brine salinity, for a reliable evaluation of CO2 injectivity related risks. The proposed workflow provides a new perspective in geochemical application for CCS studies, which relies on novel labs techniques (analyses automation), data digitalization, unification and integration with a direct connection to the numerical models. The presented procedure can be followed to assess the geochemical short-and long-term risks in carbon storage projects.
