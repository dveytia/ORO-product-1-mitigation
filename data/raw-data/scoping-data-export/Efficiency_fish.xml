To further improve, a new study from Denmark looks beyond that to the potential of LNG cold energy for vessels with dual-fuel engines. Main engine exhaust gases, jacket cooling water, seawater and an intermediate glycol-water system for HVAC cooling were considered as heat sources for the ORC unit. The maximum power output was obtained using butane as the working fluid for the seawater and glycolwater configurations, iso-pentane for jacket water and n-pentane for engine exhaust gases. The savings attainable when using the LNG cold energy to further cool engine scavenge air (to increase engine efficiency and reduce NOx emissions) were highly dependent on relative air humidity. High humidity meant that up to 39% of the heat was used to condense the water vapor rather than to cool the air in tropical conditions. The estimated fuel savings under ISO conditions (ambient temperature of 25Â°C and relative humidity of 30%) ranged from 0.41% to 0.44%. The system combines thermal energy storage with a waste heat recovery system based on ORC technology, and it was evaluated for a hypothetical ferry requiring 1MW of auxiliary power. The results suggest that the proposed system could reduce CO2 emissions by 8% and could be economically competitive with the installation of battery systems to supply power during port stays, especially for newbuilds.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210426</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Alternative Marine Fuel Research Advances and Future Trends: A Bibliometric Knowledge Mapping Approach</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">While the marine sector contributes significantly to the global economy, its environmental impact is a cause for apprehension due to growing concerns about ship emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set decarbonization strategies consistent with sustainable development goals. The impending legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from maritime shipping by at least half by 2050 and to zero by the end of the century. A growing body of research has focused on alternative marine fuel selection; hence, this bibliometric review is timely. We assess the global scientific research on alternative marine fuel for knowledge mapping based on the articles available on the Scopus database since 1973. A total of 749 publications associated with alternative marine fuel has been subjected to a range of bibliometric analyses to explore this research field quantitatively and qualitatively. The study utilized the R-studio bibliometrics package and VOSviewer bibliometric tools to generate the results. The field of study has a growth rate of 7.05\%, having a significant contribution to knowledge from the USA, the United Kingdom, India, and China. Recent trends indicate that researchers are increasingly focused on alternative fuel oil choices. By analyzing commonly used keywords, it was possible to trace a multi-criteria decision analysis process that might be utilized to construct decision support systems for alternative maritime fuel selection. According to relevant articles, the research community has concentrated on the possibility of alternative fuels being utilized in place of traditional marine fuels to reduce emissions from the shipping sector from an environmental, technological, and economic standpoint. The current study offers an updated and comprehensive overview of research trends on alternative marine fuels. Researchers interested in data mapping work in this area can begin with this endeavor.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/su14094947</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210653</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Data analytics for fuel consumption management in maritime transportation: Status and perspectives</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The shipping industry is associated with approximately three quarters of all world trade. In recent years, the sustainability of shipping has become a public concern, and various emissions control regulations to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships have been proposed and implemented globally. These regulations aim to drive the shipping industry in a low-carbon and low-pollutant direction by motivating it to switch to more efficient fuel types and reduce energy consumption. At the same time, the cyclical downturn of the world economy and high bunker prices make it necessary and urgent for the shipping industry to operate in a more cost-effective way while still satisfying global trade demand. As bunker fuel bunker (e.g., heavy fuel oil {[}HFO], liquified natural gas {[}LNG]) consumption is the main source of emissions and bunker fuel costs account for a large proportion of operating costs, shipping companies are making unprecedented efforts to optimize ship energy efficiency. It is widely accepted that the key to improving the energy efficiency of ships is the development of accurate models to predict ship fuel consumption rates under different scenarios. In this study, ship fuel consumption prediction models presented in the literature (including the academic literature and technical reports as a typical type of ``grey literature{''}) are reviewed and compared, and models that optimize ship operations based on fuel consumption prediction results are also presented and discussed. Current research challenges and promising research questions on ship performance monitoring and operational optimization are identified.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.tre.2021.102489</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210661</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Optimization using viscous flow computations for retrofitting ships in operation</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Shipping is commonly believed to be the most energy efficient mode of transport. Nonetheless, the shipping industry is required to reduce its environmental impact. The IMO has developed a package of measures for reducing shipping's CO2 emissions within an agreed timetable for adoption (Energy Efficiency Design Index for the design of new ships and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan for the operational phase). Approximately three-quarters of the vessels are rather young, so most ships in operation need solutions to reduce their pollution. In general, the suitable solutions differ from ship newbuilding, in which hull form optimization and newest machinery technology can be readily employed. This paper will demonstrate how simulation-driven design using the CAE platform FRIENDSHIP-Framework, coupled to the viscous flow CFD solver SHIPFLOW, can be used to efficiently develop optimized solutions for the retrofitting of ships in operation. Systematic variation as well as formal optimization is used in the process, coupling automated generation of geometry variants to simulation. The retrofitting solutions that will be covered are measures to decrease the resistance or increase the propulsive efficiency of the ship. Typical examples are energy-saving devices that are added to the ship or replacing parts of the hull or the appendages with new, optimized shapes. The validity of the concept will be demonstrated with the results from case studies that include a motor yacht, as well as a commercial RoPax ship.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210663</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Eco-friendly selection of ship emissions reduction strategies with emphasis on SOx and NOx emissions</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Increasing amounts of ships exhaust gases emitted worldwide forced the International Maritime Organization to issue some restricted maritime legislation for reducing the adverse environmental impacts arising from such emissions. Consequently, ships emission reduction became one of the technical and economical challenges that facing the ships, operators. The present paper addresses the different strategies that can be used to reduce those emissions, especially nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. The strategies included: applying reduction technologies onboard, using of alternative fuels, and follows one of fuel saving strategies. Using of selective catalytic reduction and sea water scrubbing appeared as the best reduction technologies onboard ships. Moreover, among the various proposed alternative fuels, natural gas, in its liquid state; has the priority to be used instead of conventional fuels. Applying one of those strategies is the matter of ship type and working area. As a numerical example, the proposed methods were investigated at a high-speed craft operating in the Red Sea area between Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The results obtained are very satisfactory from the point of view of environment and economic issues, and reflected the importance of applying those strategies.

Although past studies have looked at levels of carbon pricing, fuel savings, and the upscaling of green fuel availability separately, we combine these critical parameters for a green transition of the shipping industry to show what it takes to reach sectoral emissions reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement. We utilize a least-cost optimization model drawing on data on, e.g., emissions with lifecycle elements and the costs of green fuel production. We find that reaching maritime reduction targets for a green transition requires high growth rates for green fuel availability, carbon pricing beyond 300EUR/tCO2eq, and at least 50% in fuel demand savings compared to today's demand projection for 2050. The results show the importance of immediate climate action if maritime emissions reduction goals are to be achieved.

The energy efficiency of ship navigation is affected by many factors such as ship structure, crew operation and navigation environment. In this paper, the proposed improved second-order oscillating PSO algorithm is used to study the ship energy efficiency from the viewpoint of route optimization by considering the sea conditions and constraints. Firstly, a nonlinear optimization model for ship FOC (fuel oil consumption) considering the time-varying sea state is established. On this basis, the energy efficiency and economic benefits are analyzed in terms of multiple indicators e.g., FOC and CO2 emissions per unit distance and per unit mass of freight. Finally, the energy saving potential of the method is demonstrated with an example of an oil tanker. The results show that both FOC and emissions are reduced after optimization, and energy efficiency and economy are improved by 1.17% and 2.55%, respectively. This indicated that the considerable effect of the proposed method applied to ship energy saving optimization.

It is expected to be adopted in all marine vessel segments as the increasingly strict marine greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulations push the maritime fleet to decrease its reliance on conventional fuels such as marine diesel oil (MDO). With the development of sustainable energy sources and energy storage technologies, such as fuel cells, batteries, and super-capacitors, these renewable energy sources are integrated into the marine electric power system to reduce or even achieve zero-emission operation. A comprehensive shipboard power system model is thecrucial foundation for the further research. In this paper, a hybrid shipboard power configuration will be studied and modeled using Matlab/Simulink. The detailed model using average converters' models for the ship power system will be described. Besides, the simulation results shall be shown andanalyzed considering a typical harbor tugboat load profile.

Changes in technology, market, fiscal and other regulatory conditions may furthermore significantly influence value retention over the investment period. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) provides structure and clarity in otherwise complex decision problems, allowing decision makers to identify promising courses of action in a holistic manner. Combined with stochastic evaluation techniques, MCDM may facilitate problem exploration and learning in situations where outcomes are uncertain. In this article, we combine two variants of â€œStochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysisâ€&#x9d; (SMAA) with â€œTechnique for Ordering of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutionâ€&#x9d; (TOPSIS) to evaluate the use of biofuels, natural gas and electricity on Norwegian ferry crossings. We analyze uncertain criteria values for environmental impacts, costs, fuel access and public acceptance across seven ferry combinations for a crossing. Criteria weighting is performed deterministically and stochastically to extract and interpret the conditions under which alternatives perform well or poorly. The case study shows that all-electric propulsion is preferable, while plug-in hybrid solutions with natural gas also give a robust performance. The approach is beneficial in handling multiple, uncertain performance metrics and provides a transparent and holistic foundation for evaluating marine emission reduction technology options in ship acquisition decision contexts.

Fuel cells may provide a suitable solution, since they are fuel efficient while they emit few hazardous compounds. Various choices can be made with regard to the type of fuel cell system and logistic fuel, and it is unclear which have the best prospects for maritime application. An overview of fuel cell types and fuel processing equipment is presented, and maritime fuel cell application is reviewed with regard to efficiency, gravimetric and volumetric density, dynamic behaviour, environmental impact, safety and economics. It is shown that low temperature fuel cells using liquefied hydrogen provide a compact solution for ships with a refuelling interval up to a tens of hours, but may result in total system sizes up to five times larger than high temperature fuel cells and more energy dense fuels for vessels with longer mission requirements. The expanding infrastructure of liquefied natural gas and development state of natural gas-fuelled fuel cell systems can facilitate the introduction of gaseous fuels and fuel cells on ships. Fuel cell combined cycles, hybridisation with auxiliary electricity storage systems and redundancy improvements are identified as topics for further study. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
