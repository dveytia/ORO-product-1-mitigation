Here we report an uncomplicated post-processing method to construct Ti3+ self-doped titanium-silicon material with corrosion resistance. This is a new experimental method to regulate the electrical, optical, and photocatalytic performances of titanium-containing photocatalysts in a controlled way. Moreover, we demonstrate that Ti-O-Si materials with different calcination temperatures can serve as a highly efficient and convenient catalyst for photogeneration of hydrogen from water and simulated seawater. Consequently, the optimized Ti-O-Si (400) sample exhibits impressive enhancement in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance, by nearly 10.0 and 43.1 times compared with TiO2 nanoparticles in water and simulated seawater. The Ti-O-Si (400) with substantial Ti3+ and oxygen vacancies exhibits an excellent photocatalytic H2 production performance due to the improved separation and transmission of the photogenerated electron-hole, the extended visible light response, and corrosion resistance. Our work opens a new door to engineering the intrinsic properties of the titanium-containing materials.

However, large uncertainties remain concerning the impacts of climate change on the magnitude and variability of carbon fluxes and storage across a range of TFFW. In this study, we developed a process-driven Tidal Freshwater Wetlands DeNitrification-DeComposition model (TFW-DNDC) that has integrated new features, such as soil salinity effects on plant productivity and soil organic matter decomposition to explore carbon dynamics in the TFFW in response to drought-induced saltwater intrusion. Eight sites along the floodplains of the Waccamaw River (USA) and the Savannah River (USA) were selected to represent the TFFW transition from healthy to moderately and highly salt-impacted forests, and eventually to oligohaline marshes. The TFW-DNDC was calibrated and validated using field observed annual litterfall, stem growth, root growth, soil heterotrophic respiration, and soil organic carbon storage. Analyses indicate that plant productivity and soil carbon sequestration in TFFW could change substantially in response to increased soil pore water salinity and reduced soil water table due to drought, but in interactive ways dependent on the river simulated. These responses are variable due to nonlinear relationships between carbon cycling processes and environmental drivers. Plant productivity, plant respiration, soil organic carbon sequestration rate, and storage in the highly salt-impacted forest sites decreased significantly under drought conditions compared with normal conditions. Considering the high likelihood of healthy and moderately salt-impacted forests becoming highly salt-impacted forests under future climate change and sea-level rise, it is very likely that the TFFW will lose their capacity as carbon sinks without up-slope migration.

This research provides an economical analysis of the short term alternative options for ship owners: to fit exhaust gas cleaning system on board using heavy fuel oil; to burn marine gas oil or to switch from heavy fuel oil to low sulfur fuel entering emissions controlled areas. An economic evaluation model of investments has been developed in order to compare the different solutions. Based on technical data of engines and operative vessel profiles, the model provides possible measurement tools to consider for the investment choice in the defined reference scenario. Different scenarios can be created by modifying investment conditions, environmental regulations and fuel price forecasts. The results of the model application to three real vessels of different types encourage the ship owners to adopt the option of the seawater scrubber.

In order to assess trace element levels and distribution in the Levante Bay (Vulcano Island, NE Sicily, Italy) and its suitability for studying biological effects of pH decline, Ba, Fe and trace elements (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) in sediment were analysed from 7 transects. Where present, Cymodocea nodosa leaves and epiphytes were also analysed. At the spatial scale of the bay, trace element concentrations in sediments and biota showed wide variability, possibly related to both input from fluid emissions and seawater physico-chemical variables (i.e. pH and Eh), which may considerably affect the solubility and bioavailability of potentially harmful trace elements. According to two pollution indices (MSPI: Marine Sediment Pollution Index and SQG-Q: Sediment Quality Guideline Quotient), the bay can be considered to be affected by low contamination with moderate potential for adverse biological effects, especially in the area between about 150 and 350 m from the primary vent, where localized detrimental effects on biota may occur. Generally, biological samples showed concentrations that were comparable with the lower values of seagrass ranges. The overall results of this study support the complex spatial dynamics of trace elements in the CO2 vent studied, which are constrained by both direct input from the vent and/or biogeochemical processes affecting element precipitation at the sediment-seawater interface. Consequently, great caution should be used when relating biological changes along pH gradients to the unifactorial effect of pH only, as interactions with concurrent, multiple stressors, including trace element enrichments, may occur. This finding has implications for the use of CO2 vents as analogues in ocean acidification research. They should be considered more appropriately as analogues for low pH environments with non-negligible trace element contamination which, in a scenario of continuous increase in anthropogenic pollution, may be very common.

During this period, the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), which was adopted by the International Maritime Organization, expecting to significantly reduce CO2 from ships, has become an important key. It has triggered a change in use from steam turbine systems and dual fuel diesel electrics to highâ€&#x90;efficiency main engines such as MEâ€&#x90;GI engines to meet the EEDI requirements. However, since the MEâ€&#x90;GI engines use 300 bar of fuel gas pressure, it is necessary to resolve problems of the pressure controllability and to prevent the reductions of the reâ€&#x90;liquefaction amount caused by clogging of the lubricant mixed with the fuel gas during the compression. The purpose of this study is to propose a novel control strategy with a newly developed configuration for controlling the pressure so as not to trip the BOG compressors when the MEâ€&#x90;GI engines are tripped, and for preventing a reduction on reâ€&#x90;liquefaction amount. Unlike the typical configuration used in the current vessels, this proposal separately provides the fuel gas at 150 bar without lubricants to the reâ€&#x90;liquefaction. In addition, three control strategies are proposed, depending upon the application of multiâ€&#x90;controllers and the location of the pressure transmitters. A simulation was conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed method, focusing on the controllability of the pressure and the reâ€&#x90;liquefaction amount, in comparison with the typical configuration. As results of the simulation, the proposal showed excellent controllability without trips of the BOG compressors even in abnormal conditions and confirmed the great reliquefaction performance.

Here we present a methodological approach which combines seismic geophysics and geochemical measurements to quantitatively estimate the total stock of carbon held within marine sediment. Through the application of this methodology to Loch Sunart, a fjord on the west coast of Scotland, we have generated the first full sedimentary carbon inventory for a fjordic system. The sediments of Loch Sunart hold 26.9 +/- 0.5 Mt of carbon split between 11.5 +/- 0.2 and 15.0 +/- 0.4 Mt of organic and inorganic carbon respectively. These new quantitative estimates of carbon stored in coastal sediments are significantly higher than previous estimates. Through an area-normalised comparison to adjacent Scottish peatland carbon stocks, we have determined that these mid-latitude fjords are significantly more effective as carbon stores than their terrestrial counterparts. This initial work supports the concept that fjords are important environments for the burial and long-term storage of carbon and therefore should be considered and treated as unique environments within the global carbon cycle.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.5194/bg-13-5771-2016</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210122</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Guidelines and cost-benefit analysis of the Structural Health Monitoring implementation in offshore wind turbine support structures</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">This paper investigates how the implementation of Structural Health Monitoring Systems (SHMS) in the support structure (SS) of offshore wind turbines (OWT) affects capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX) of offshore wind farms (WF). In order to determine the added value of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), the balance between the reduction in OPEX and the increase in CAPEX is evaluated. In this paper, guidelines for SHM implementation in offshore WF are developed and applied to a baseline scenario. The application of these guidelines consist of a review of present regulations in the United Kingdom and Germany, the development of SHM strategy, where the first stage of the Statistical Pattern Recognition (SPR) paradigm is explored, failure modes that can be monitored are identified, and SHM technologies and sensor distributions within the turbines are described for a baseline scenario. Furthermore, an inspection strategy where the different structural inspections to be carried out above and below water is also developed, together with an inspection plan for the lifetime of the structures, for the aforementioned baseline scenario. Once the guidelines have been followed and the SHM and inspection strategies developed, a cost-benefit analysis is performed on the baseline case (10% instrumented assets) and three other scenarios with 20%, 30% and 50% of instrumented assets. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the effects of SHM hardware cost and the time spent in completing the inspections on OPEX and CAPEX of the WF. The results show that SHM hardware cost increases CAPEX significantly, however this increase is much lower than the reduction in OPEX caused by SHM. The results also show that an increase in the percentage of instrumented assets will reduce OPEX and this reduction is considerably higher than the cost of SHM implementation.

Data-driven methods are employed first to approximately obtain a known analytic expression for isotropic local blockage effects, and then deployed to find candidate expressions for anisotropic local blockage effects. The dataset for the analysis of anisotropic local blockage is collected from 3D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of an infinitely wide array of actuator disks for nearly 2,000 different blockage configurations. This study builds upon previous work in array optimisation of both tidal and wind turbines, where the local power coefficient may increase substantially for optimal array configuration. A brief discussion on the relationship between the local blockage and wind farm blockage is also provided. Other theoretical approaches and possible refinements to the presented analytic model are also discussed.

Among other combinations of stressors, the impact of trace metal toxicity on marine phytoplankton under the ocean acidification scenario is an important aspect to address. Such multiple stressor studies are rare from the Arabian Sea, one of the highest productive oceanic provinces within the North Indian Ocean. We studied the interactive impacts of copper (Cu) and CO2 enrichment on two natural phytoplankton communities from the eastern and central Arabian Sea. Low dissolved silicate (DSi &lt; 2 mu M) favoured smaller diatoms (e.g. Nitzschia sp.) and non-diatom (Phaeocystis). CO2 enrichment caused both positive (Nitzschia sp. and Phaeocystis sp.) and negative (Cylindrotheca closterium, Navicula sp., Pseudo-nitzschia sp., Alexandrium sp., and Gymnodinium sp.) growth impacts. The addition of Cu under the ambient CO2 level (A-CO2) hindered cell division in most of the species, whereas Chla contents were nearly unaffected. Interestingly, CO2 enrichment seemed to alleviate Cu toxicity in some species (Nitzschia sp., Cylindrotheca closterium, Guinardia flaccida, and Phaeocystis) and increased their growth rates. This could be related to the cellular Cu demand and energy budget at elevated CO2 levels. Dinoflagellates were more sensitive to Cu supply compared to diatoms and prymnesiophytes and could be related to the unavailability of prey. Such community shifts in response to the projected ocean acidification, oligotrophy, and Cu pollution may impact trophic transfer and carbon cycling in this region.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s11356-022-22709-2</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210131</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Supporting Predictive Maintenance of a Ship by Analysis of Onboard Measurements</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Ship hull and propeller fouling has a severe impact both on fuel costs and on greenhouse gas emission, thus, it is an important subject to consider when developing a maintenance plan to enhance energy efficiency and reduce gas emissions from ships. This paper presents a two-step approach for evaluating the actual propulsive performance of a ship through analyzing continuous onboard measurement. First, the onboard monitored data are corrected for the wind and wave effects using fast and transparent empirical methods. Second, the corrected data are filtered based on hydrodynamic criteria. A case study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology. Subsequently, the processed data are analyzed by mathematical tools to derive an engine power-rpm curve to represent the actual propulsive performance of the ship. By comparing the derived curve against the nominal curve for engine design, it is possible to identify the deterioration of the ship's condition, which is the key task in developing the identification capability that is needed in a proactive maintenance procedure. This methodology is expected to support the maritime sector in combating climate change by reducing the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from ship operations.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/jmse10020215</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210133</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Generalized power transmission control of VSC-based multi-terminal HVDC systems for offshore wind farms integration</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">In this paper, a generalized power transmission control method is developed for voltage source converter (VSC)-based multi-terminal HVDC systems.

Here we assess LOAC carbon cycling before the industrial period and perturbed by direct human interventions, including climate change. In our view of the global carbon cycle, the traditional `long-range loop', which carries carbon from terrestrial ecosystems to the open ocean through rivers, is reinforced by two `short-range loops' that carry carbon from terrestrial ecosystems to inland waters and from tidal wetlands to the open ocean. Using a mass-balance approach, we find that the pre-industrial uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide by terrestrial ecosystems transferred to the ocean and outgassed back to the atmosphere amounts to 0.65 +/- 0.30 petagrams of carbon per year (+/- 2 sigma). Humans have accelerated the cycling of carbon between terrestrial ecosystems, inland waters and the atmosphere, and decreased the uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide from tidal wetlands and submerged vegetation. Ignoring these changing LOAC carbon fluxes results in an overestimation of carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems by 0.6 +/- 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year, and an underestimation of sedimentary and oceanic carbon storage. We identify knowledge gaps that are key to reduce uncertainties in future assessments of LOAC fluxes. An assessment of the land-to-ocean cycling of carbon through inland waters, estuaries, tidal wetlands and continental shelf waters provides a perspective on the global carbon cycle and identifies key knowledge gaps.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1038/s41586-021-04339-9</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210146</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Sustainability and life cycle assessment (LCA) of macroalgae-derived single cell oils</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Marine macroalgae (seaweed) has many advantages over terrestrial crops as a source of renewable biomass but is severely underutilised at present, especially within Europe. In particular, macroalgae has elevated poly- and monosaccharide content, making it an ideal feedstock as a heterotrophic fermentation sugar source for the production of higher value chemicals. Recent reports have detailed the suitability of seaweeds as a feedstock for the production of single-cell oils (SCOs) which have application in food, oleochemicals and fuels. It is proposed that a biorefinery system based on the production of SCOs alongside other secondary metabolites, has the potential to provide a sustainable replacement to terrestrial oils such as palm oil. This work therefore evaluates, for the first time, the environmental and economic sustainability of a production process for SCOs from seaweed Saccharina latissima using the oleaginous yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima. Two alternative fermentation systems were considered, and uncertainties associated with the seasonal variation in seaweed carbohydrate yield and fermentation performance were integrated into the analysis. From an environmental perspective, the work indicates that seaweed derived SCO lipids and fats can be comparable to a terrestrial oil mix, with a potential climate change impact ranging between 2.5 and 9.9 kg CO2 eq. kg(-1) refined SCO. Interestingly and of particular significance, environmental impacts are mainly dominated by energy demand within fermentation and upstream processing steps. From an economic perspective, a break-even selling price for the oil was determined as between epsilon 5,300-epsilon 31,000 tonne(-1) refined SCO, which was highly dependent on cost of the seaweed feedstock. Overall, we demonstrate that key uncertainties relating to seaweed cultivation costs and hydrolysate fermentation at scale result in a large range in values for environmental impact and economic return on investment. Yet even within the constraints and limitations of current knowhow, seaweed already offers a viable proposition for the competitive production of exotic oils similar to cocoa or shea butter in price and nature.

Without such a reference state, sequestration services may be severely overestimated and when used within a cap and trade system, it will lead to an increased rate of carbon dioxide emissions.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/geosciences9020090</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210148</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Numerical simulation of multi-body wave energy converter</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Multi-body wave energy converter is being considered to be one of harvest technologies to maximize the potential to extract the renewable source of energy from the ocean.

This paper describes a set of numerical simulations designed to investigate the optimum configuration of a simple two-body point absorber model. The results confirm that the ability to extract energy depends on the mass and geometry of the moving parts, together with the damping of generator. It is also demonstrated that the outcome is sensitive to the distance between the two moving bodies and local wave condition.

Until these engines are replaced by alternatives the focus will be on new fuels, particularly, alternative fuels to replace high sulfur fuel oil. LNG is considered the alternative fuel frontrunner. Producing almost no SOx or particulate matter emissions, LNG also boasts low NOx emissions and GHG emission reduction benefits (from fuel tank to stack) of between up to 22%, dependent on engine type. Despite these advantages, ships will not achieve zero CO2 emissions with LNG alone since it is still a fossil fuel, posing the additional challenge of CH4 slip. Another challenge with LNG has been limited bunkering infrastructure and higher CAPEX requirements. LPG is one possible alternative to LNG. Methanol and ethanol, on the other hand, present other alternatives to LNG, with similar profiles to LPG. As drop-in fuels, methanol and ethanol are easier to handle in comparison to LNG, and benefit from a well-developed global terminal network. Alternative fuels for moving towards carbon neutrality, biofuel, synthetic methane, synthetic natural gas, and biomethane, are being considered. Meanwhile, H2 and NH3 are being considered for a carbon-free future.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210152</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Use of a Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment (FOCE) System to Evaluate the Effects of Ocean Acidification on the Foraging Behavior of a Deep-Sea Urchin</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The influence of ocean acidification in deep-sea ecosystems is poorly understood but is expected to be large because of the presumed low tolerance of deep-sea taxa to environmental change. We used a newly developed deep-sea free ocean CO2 enrichment (dp-FOCE) system(1) to evaluate the potential consequences of future ocean acidification on the feeding behavior of a deep-sea echinoid, the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus fragilis. The dp-FOCE system simulated future ocean acidification inside an experimental enclosure where observations of feeding behavior were performed. We measured the average movement (speed) of urchins as well as the time required (foraging time) for S. fragilis to approach its preferred food (giant kelp) in the dp-FOCE chamber (-0.46 pH units) and a control chamber (ambient pH). Measurements were performed during each of 4 trials (days -2, 2, 24, 27 after CO2 injection) during the month-long period when groups of urchins were continuously exposed to low pH or control conditions. Although urchin speed did not vary significantly in relation to pH or time exposed, foraging time was significantly longer for urchins in the low-pH treatment. This first deep-sea FOCE experiment demonstrated the utility of the FOCE system approach and suggests that the chemosensory behavior of a deep-sea urchin may be impaired by ocean acidification.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1021/es501603r</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210153</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Green chemistry.

Their joint effort is called Cellana. This is another stage in the effort of the Shell company to develop a new generation of bio-fuels from sustainable non-foodstuff raw materials. The algae are promising because they grow fast, are rich in vegetable oils, and can be cultivated in basins of sea water, reducing to a minimum the use of fertile earth and fresh water. Shell is the majority shareholder of Cellana. The site, on loan from the Natural Laboratory of the Hawaii Authority (NELHA) is near commercial companies that specialize in algae for the industry of nutrition and of pharmaceuticals. The algae will come from Hawaii or will be approved by the Hawaii Ministry of Agriculture. Once harvested, the vegetable oil in the algae will be extracted. The program will have recourse to counsel in science from the Universities of Hawaii, Southern Mississippi, and, in Nova Scotia, Dalhousie. Algae have the advantage of rapid growth. They can double their volume several times in one day and produce much more oil per acre than alternative vegetables such as rapeseed oil, palm oil, soya oil, or jatropha oil. Also, the facilities can be built along the coasts, thus not inconveniencing traditional agriculture. In the long term, the aquatic farms can absorb or capture the carbon dioxide emissions directly from industrial facilities such as power plants. The Cellana demonstration plant will use carbon dioxide stored in cylinders to explore this potential.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210157</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Coordinated Converter Control Strategy in Hybrid AC/DC Power Systems for System Frequency Support</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">This paper proposes a coordinated converter control strategy for multi-terminal dc (MTDC) grids in hybrid AC/DC power systems. Previous works have shown the possibility of providing frequency containment reserve (FCR) from offshore wind farms to ac grids through MTDC grids using frequency and dc voltage droop control. However, due to the characteristics of dc voltage droop control, the frequency support would come both from offshore wind farms and all other ac grids connected to the MTDC. This paper proposes a coordinated MTDC converter control strategy that maximizes the share of the FCR contribution from an offshore wind farm and reduces the contribution of other ac grids. A hybrid AC/DC power system consisting of offshore wind farm and two asynchronous grids connected through an MTDC grid is used as a test system. Using the test system, different scenarios are analyzed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed coordinated control strategy.

At each site the length of the turbine rows, the local blockage ratio, and the location of the turbines are varied. For Portland Bill the presence of an array with multiple rows of turbines is also considered.

The development and utilization of low head and ultralow head hydraulic resources can increase the runner's energy parameters, make up for the defects of large size and low speed of the unit, and reduce the construction investment. The bulb tubular turbine's operation stability and structural strength are compared and analyzed by the orthogonal test method to improve the perfomance of bulb tubular turbine. The results show that the optimal design scheme can be obtained when the number of guide vane is 16, the distance between the guide vane and the blade is 1995 mm, the hub ratio is 0.31, the relative twist angle of the blade is 27 degrees, and the cascade density is 0.72. After optimization, the bulb tubular turbine's efficiency and output are increased by 5.72\% and 2.86\% at a low flow rate, respectively. The vortex at the tailpipe is reduced, and the blade work effect and the cavitation performance are well. The maximum pressure pulsation amplitude in the flow passage is reduced by 73.15\%, the maximum blade deformation is reduced by 39.59\%, and the maximum blade static stress is reduced by 13.16\%.

To prevent blockage of hydrate, thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors (THIs) have been injected into the subsea flowlines; however, the high injection amount of THIs may drive up operational expenditure (OPEX) with increasing water depth of oil and gas reservoirs. Kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) have been investigated as an alternative for few decades. In this study, microcapsules were designed using microfluidics concept for efficient release of KHIs at off-shore transport line of hydrocarbon and gas. Hydrate formation kinetics among four different systems, pure water, microcapsules containing poly vinyl caprolactam (PVCap), microcapsules without PVCap, and PVCap aqueous solution was investigated. The dispersive Raman was applied to understand hydrate formation on microcapsules with temperature change under static condition, and autoclave study also was employed to confirm the shear rate effect on microcapsule stability. From the both experiments, it was confirmed that release of KHI solution from microcapsules delayed the formation of hydrate at the target temperature and showed a similar efficacy comparing to the bulk KHI solution under turbulent condition. These results indicated the release of PVCap solution can be controlled by adjusting the membrane thickness of the microcarriers, which would provide operational flexibility to manage the risk of hydrate plug formation.

A significant consideration for the likely power generation capacity of a tidal turbine is the effect of biofouling on the blade performance. A turbine blade surface is susceptible to large scale macrofouling, mainly from encrusters, such as barnacles and molluscs, colonising the developing surface. This paper considers the case of when a barnacle attaches to the upper (suction) surface of the blade section. Results of experiments to investigate the unsteady flow characteristics of the blade section are presented, and the modification of the hydrodynamic performance coefficients due to the presence of a barnacle is evaluated. The barnacle has no significant effect upon the lift in steady flow and unsteady flow, but there is a very large increase in the drag. Dependent upon the degree of barnacle encrustation, the effect on a turbine blade drag may be significant and lead to a degradation of a turbine predicted performance.

The climate services performed by the oceans can be described as an interaction between a physical and a biological carbon pump. Whereas the role of the physical carbon pump is well established, the full scale of the climate services provided by the biological carbon pump has only recently been understood. This pump is made up of services provided by different marine species, from microbes to marine mammals. Many of these species are managed under the international law of the sea and subject to the concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Although the MSY concept has developed since its inception, maximum generation of fish for human consumption remains the core objective according to the law of the sea. Under MSY based management, states are not required to consider the climate services represented by different marine organisms, making this regime unable to balance the interest of maximizing fish as a product against the oceansâ€™ role in carbon sequestration. In order to make optimal use of the carbon sequestering features of marine organisms, this perspective proposes five action points. Foremost, MSY should be complemented with a new management objective: maximum carbon sequestration (MCS). Although many aspects of climate-based fisheries management remain to be explored, it appears clear that this would imply allowing stocks to recover to maintain a larger amount of biomass, increasing conservation measures for species particularly efficient in providing negative emissions, differentiation of fisheries within species as well as a new approach to ecosystem management. Climate reforming international fisheries law could make an important contribution to the operationalization of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals. As a first step, international guidelines should be developed on how to integrate the concept of maximum carbon sequestration in fisheries management.

Marine CO2 system data were collected monthly at 20 stations between October 2018 and February 2020. While additional data are still needed, the climate-level data collected thus far have uncovered novel insights into spatiotemporal distributions of and variability in the regional marine CO2 system, especially at low salinities in shallow, river-forced shelf regions. The data provide a strong foundation with which to continue monitoring OA conditions across the region.

General environmental conditions (e.g., biofouling, turbidity) and carbon-specific conditions (e.g., wide diel variations) present significant challenges to acquiring long-term measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with satisfactory accuracy and resolution. SEAS-DIC is a new in situ instrument designed to provide calibrated, high-frequency, long-term measurements of DIC in marine and fresh waters. Sample water is first acidified to convert all DIC to carbon dioxide (CO2). The sample and a known reagent solution are then equilibrated across a gas-permeable membrane. Spectrophotometric measurement of reagent pH can thereby determine the sample DIC over a wide dynamic range, with inherent calibration provided by the pH indicator's molecular characteristics. Field trials indicate that SEAS-DIC performs well in biofouling and turbid waters, with a DIC accuracy and precision of âˆ¼2 Î¼mol kg-1 and a measurement rate of approximately once per minute. The acidic reagent protects the sensor cell from biofouling, and the gas-permeable membrane excludes particulates from the optical path. This instrument, the first spectrophotometric system capable of automated in situ DIC measurements, positions DIC to become a key parameter for in situ CO 2-system characterizations.

DC collection systems have the advantages of reduced weight and size of the DC cables and DC cables are free from reactive power compensation. The heavy 50/60 Hz transformers in the offshore transmission platform of AC collection systems can be replaced with smaller size medium frequency transformers in DC collection systems. However, the need for a high power DC-DC converter with high voltage transformation ratios and DC protection methods will remain a challenge for the DC collection systems. Also, DC collection systems do not necessarily reduce the power conversion stages compared to the AC collection systems even if HVDC (High Voltage DC) transmission is used to transfer the offshore wind power from the collection systems to the onshore grids. A cost assessment study verifies that the cost reductions achieved by the reduced size of the DC cables and offshore platform are outweighed by the cost of DC protective devices and DC-DC converters. This is because the length of the DC collection cables is relatively short compared to the long distance HVDC cables. The technical comparison supported by the simulation results shows that the total losses in the DC collection systems are higher than in AC collection systems. The effect of collection bus voltages on the losses is analysed for the DC collection systems.

The highest rate of change in climate is observed in the Arctic where the summer ice is diminishing at an accelerated rate. The loss of Arctic sea ice increases radiative forcing and contributes to global warming. Restoring reflectivity of Arctic ice could be a powerful lever to help in the effort to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. Polar ice restoration should be considered in planning of 1.5 degrees C pathways. In this paper, a novel localized surface albedo modification technique is presented that shows promise as a method to increase multiyear ice using reflective floating materials, chosen so as to have low subsidiary environmental impact. Detailed climate modeling studying the climate impact of such a method reveals more than 1.5 degrees C cooler temperatures over a large part of the Arctic when simulating global sea ice albedo modification. In a region north of Barents and Kara Seas temperatures have been reduced by 3 degrees C and in North Canada by almost 1 degrees C. Additionally, there are notable increases in sea ice thickness (20-50 cm Arctic wide) and ice concentration (>15-20\% across large parts of central Arctic). These results suggest that the geoengineering technology proposed in this study may be a viable instrument for restoring Arctic ice. Plain Language Summary This paper describes a method to preserve and restore ice in the Arctic in order to reduce the effects of climate change. This method is benign by design, developed to restore ice in the Arctic in targeted areas to build back the reflective ice that has melted over the past several decades. The aim is to restore the Arctic ice's historic function of reflecting sunlight. By applying reflective materials such as glass microspheres on young, low-reflectivity sea ice, we can protect the young ice from the summer Sun, much like a white shirt fends off the Sun for a person on a hot summer day. This way the ice may be conserved and converted over time into highly reflective multiyear sea ice. Climate modeling shows that this method can cool the Arctic significantly and can rebuild Arctic ice area and volume, hence reducing Arctic as well as global temperature rise.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1029/2018EF000820</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210188</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Control strategies of a dc based offshore wind farm with series connected collection grid</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">This paper presents the control strategy of a dc series offshore wind farm with an onshore modular multilevel converter (MMC). The series connection of the dc wind turbines establishes the HVDC transmission voltage level with neither offshore transformer nor centralized converter station, indicating huge savings on offshore wind farm investment. However, power production unbalance in the wind farm or bypass of any wind turbine may impose overvoltage at the outputs of several wind turbines. A global control strategy, which regulates the HVDC voltage level by controlling the onshore MMC, is thus proposed to ensure the operation of each wind turbine under a safe voltage level while no power production is lost in the wind farm. This paper first introduces the whole wind generation system. Then the steady state analysis of the dc series offshore wind farm and the overvoltage phenomenon are described, which lead to the proposal of the global control strategy. The detailed realization of the global control strategy by use of the MMC is given after a short recall of the MMC arm average model.

Therefore, for coastal ships constructed in Korea, the emission of air pollutants should be reduced by alternative fuel and improving their propulsion system. Accordingly, the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries in Korea has announced a plan to promote the conversion of all 140 government ships into eco-friendly ships using liquefied natural gas or electric propulsion systems by 2030. To apply these propulsion systems, rules, and regulations of the Korea government must first be reorganized. In this study, the type and development trend of electric propulsion systems are reviewed, and trends in regulations for installing electric propulsion systems on ships in various countries, including the United States and Europe, and institutions, including the IEC, IEEE, and International Maritime Organization, are analyzed. Finally, the standardization of the regulation system is discussed to facilitate the introduction of eco-friendly ships to Korea, and relevant implications will be presented. Â© 2020 The Author(s).

Differences in crest heights and force peaks resulting from directional spread waves are analysed. The wave realizations are reproduced numerically in the fully nonlinear wave model OceanWave3D. The numerical reproductions compare well to the experiments. Only for the largest forces significant differences are seen, which is due to a very simple breaking filter applied in OceanWave3D. In the wave spectra, the higher harmonics occur for smaller frequencies than the straight multiples of the peak frequency. Further, the higher harmonics of the multidirectional wave spectra contain less energy. Both effects can be explained by the second order wave theory. Finally, the computed wave kinematics are used to investigate the dynamic response of an offshore wind turbine. The excitation of the first natural frequency is largest for the unidirectional wave realizations, as the higher harmonics are largest for these realizations.

However, as this volume demonstrates it is also important to remember that the sea covers more than two thirds of our planetâ€™s surface and provides a wide range of essential goods and services upon which humans, and ultimately all life on Earth, depend. Indeed, land-sea interactions (LSI) have been significant in shaping patterns of human activity on both land and sea since ancient times. For example, humans have always looked to the sea for food, transport and trade, waste disposal and cultural and spiritual fulfilment, and coastal areas have been favoured places for human settlement. Today 16 of the worldâ€™s 23 mega cities (with populations exceeding 10 million) are in coastal locations1 and with the prospect of the global population rising from 7.6 billion in 2017 to over 11 billion by 21002 ongoing urbanisation of coastal areas can be anticipated. Beyond general trends of globalisation and the importance of international connectivity, one of the factors driving contemporary coastal and marine development is that the sea is increasingly being seen as a source of new â€˜Blue Growthâ€™ opportunities. Established maritime sectors, such as shipping and offshore oil and gas production, are now frequently accompanied by a range of other offshore uses, such as aquaculture and wind power developments. Technological advances are also opening new business possibilities in sectors such as blue biotechnology, ocean renewable energy and marine mineral extraction3. Alongside these very tangible human interactions with the marine environment, modern science is revealing the reality of less tangible, but in many ways more profound dependencies on the sea, including the vital role it plays in climate regulation and carbon capture. Equally, it is enhancing our understanding of the intricate web of connections between human activity - both land and sea based - and the health of the marine environment.

This has a huge impact on China's coastal shipping ships. These ships can adopt the following three sulfur abatement options to deal with it: (1) using low-sulfur fuel, (2) using an exhaust gas cleaning system, and (3) using alternative fuel Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). This paper has established two models from two different perspectives to analyze the differences of abatement options between the shipowners and the general public. Sensitivity analyses are carried out on the factors affecting the sulfur abatement options, including remaining lifespan of ships, ship power, initial cost of sulfur abatement options, and fluctuations in the price of fuel. By analyzing the impact of these factors on the choice of the shipowners to reduce sulfur emission, this paper proposes some incentives and subsidy policies accordingly, which can provide references for policymakers.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.105658</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210205</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Capacity credit evaluation of tamla offshore wind farm by using of probability simulation method</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">This study is described an algorithm for probabilistic production cost credit evaluation of wind turbine generators (WTG) with multi-state and aims to analysis the reliability of wind power generator in Jeju Island power system in order to maintain the operational state of power system at the reliability level.

Most of the propelling engines are diesels, and they give out a lot of smoke and harmful emissions to the air and the unburned oil in water. We have researched and developed a series of marine LPG engines which were used for propelling or generating electricity on boats to answer the request of environment protection in the field of rivers, streams, lakes and reservoirs in China.

The International Maritime Organization has adopted regulations to impose limits on greenhouse gas emissions originated from fuel combustion of marine vessels. Such regulations are introduced in terms of energy efficiency design index and energy efficiency operational indicator. Extensive electrification of ship propulsion and shipboard power systems has been vastly proposed in the literature to make onboard energy systems more efficient. However, energy efficiency in the context of maritime transport is becoming even more stringent. Various technologies and operational practices therefore are being proposed to ensure full compliance with the tightening restrictions. The methods to increase energy efficiency and environmental performance of all-electric ships to satisfy such requirements involve integration of energy storage with a contribution of intelligent power management to optimize power split between various power generation sources; a tendency toward DC power distribution due to eliminating the need of all generators to be synchronized at a specific frequency; installation of unconventional propulsors for greater maneuverability requirements while keeping fuel consumption low; adoption of low carbon content fuel like liquefied natural gas for dual fuel diesel electric propulsion; establishment of onboard renewable energy systems for alternative clean power options; fuel cell integration in complementary operation with conventional diesel generators. This paper identifies promising technologies and practices that are applicable to onboard energy systems of all-electric ships and also reveals energy efficiency sensitivity of all-electric ships to different applications. The proposed strategies should be eventually combined with alternative technology-based and operational-based measures as implemented on conventional propulsion ships in order to realize full potential for energy efficient operation.

On a mesocosmic scale, the CO2 levels in seawater can be manipulated to evaluate experimentally the consequences of OA on marine organisms (vertebrates and invertebrates). An ideal manipulation of carbonate chemistry should mimic exactly the changes to carbonate chemistry, which will occur in years to come. Although some methods have been described in the literature, here we describe in detail a simple, robust and inexpensive system to produce CO2-enriched seawater by bubbling the seawater with air-CO2 mixtures. The system uses mass flow controllers (MFC) to blend atmospheric air with pure CO2 to produce two pCO(2) levels. The air-CO2 mixtures are delivered continuously to seawater equilibration reservoirs, and simultaneously to an infrared CO2 analyser to verify CO2 levels in the air-CO2 mixture delivered to the equilibration tanks. We monitored both pH and total alkalinity in the equilibration reservoirs over a period of one year in order to document the long-term performance of this system for simulating the future carbonate chemistry of seawater in a coastal laboratory. System performance was sufficient to maintain three contrasting (e.g., 397, 709 and 1032 matm) and relatively constant (the coefficient of variability was 11 \%, 9 \% and 9 \% respectively) seawater pCO(2) during a year-long monitoring.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.4067/S0716-078X2013000400006</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210226</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Accounting for non-photosynthetic vegetation in remote-sensing-based estimates of carbon flux in wetlands</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Monitoring productivity in coastal wetlands is important due to their high carbon sequestration rates and potential role in climate change mitigation. We tested agricultural- and forest-based methods for estimating the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f APAR), a key parameter for modelling gross primary productivity (GPP), in a restored, managed wetland with a dense litter layer of non-photosynthetic vegetation, and we compared the difference in canopy light transmission between a tidally influenced wetland and the managed wetland. The presence of litter reduced correlations between spectral vegetation indices and f APAR. In the managed wetland, a two-band vegetation index incorporating simulated World View-2 or Hyperion green and near-infrared bands, collected with a field spectroradiometer, significantly correlated with f APAR only when measured above the litter layer, not at the ground where measurements typically occur. Measures of GPP in these systems are difficult to capture via remote sensing, and require an investment of sampling effort, practical methods for measuring green leaf area and accounting for background effects of litter and water.

This paper presents the wind farm site suitability analysis using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach based on geographic information system (GIS) modeling. This analysis is based on different climatic, economic, aesthetic and environmental criteria like wind resource, accessibility by roads, proximity to the electrical grid, and optimum/safe distance from various settlements and airports. Using information from published literature, criteria constraints like buffer zones, exclusion zones and suitability scores for each criteria is developed. An analytical hierarchy process, AHP is employed to assign appropriate weights to the criteria according to their relative importance. The developed model is then applied to the entire Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The most suitable sites are found to be (i) near Ras Tanura on the coast in the Eastern Province; (ii) Turaif in Al-Jawf region at northern borders and (iii) Al-Wajh on the coast in the western region. The central and southeastern region is found to be unsuitable mainly due to scarce wind resource, few settlements and less connectivity by roads and electrical grid. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A heavily calcified type A strain isolated from the Norwegian Sea was selected and batch cultured in order to understand whether acclimation to OA was mediated mainly by CO2 or H+, and how it impacted cell growth performance, calcification, and physiological stress management. Emiliania huxleyi responded differently to each acidification method. CO2-enriched aeration (1200 mu atm, pH 7.62) induced a negative effect on the cells when compared to acidification caused by decreasing pH alone (pH 7.60). The growth rates of the coccolithophore were more negatively affected by high pCO(2) than by low pH without CO2 enrichment with respect to the control (400 mu atm, pH 8.1). High CO2 also affected cell viability and promoted the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was not observed under low pH. This suggests a possible metabolic imbalance induced by high CO2 alone. In contrast, the affinity for carbon uptake was negatively affected by both low pH and high CO2. Photochemistry was only marginally affected by either acidification method when analysed by PAM fluorometry. The POC and PIC cellular quotas and the PIC:POC ratio shifted along the different phases of the cultures; consequently, calcification did not follow the same pattern observed in cell stress and growth performance. Specifically, acidification by HCl addition caused a higher proportion of severely deformed coccoliths, than CO2 enrichment. These results highlight the capacity of CO2 rather than acidification itself to generate metabolic stress, not reducing calcification.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s00248-022-02035-3</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210233</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">A large increase of the CO2 sink in the western tropical North Atlantic from 2002 to 2009</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Determining a robust trend of surface ocean carbon dioxide (CO2) for a period shorter than a decade is challenging due to large seasonal variability and a sparsity of data. Here, we estimate the multiannual trend of surface CO2 in the region of 19N-20N, 65W-68W for the period of 2002-2009. We used an unprecedented number of high-quality underway data of the fugacity of CO2 in surface seawater (fCO2SW) collected from 137 cruises using an automated system onboard the cruise ship Explorer of the Seas. The growth rate of fCO2SW was estimated by two de-seasonalization approaches that showed similar and significantly lower values than the atmospheric increases, leading to a large increase in the CO 2 sink. The seasonal difference in the trends was significant, with fCO2SW values in winter showing no increase, while summer fCO 2SW values lagged only slightly with the atmosphere. We attribute the lack of an increase in winter fCO2SW values to sea surface temperature changes, which are closely correlated with the El Nio-Southern Oscillation cycle, and to changes in the mixed layer depth. The slower increase of fCO2SW is also related to decreases in salinity. The 8-year averaged annual net sea-air CO2 flux was -0.06 0.18 mol m -2 yr-1 compared to a climatology that shows a flux out of the ocean of +0.11 mol m-2 yr-1. The increasing flux differs from previous, mostly longer-term results for regional studies and time series stations in the North Atlantic, which suggests a decrease or no change in oceanic CO2 uptake.

This notion is based on a theoretical framework suggesting that detrimental effects on energy use are caused by plasma acid-base disruption in response to hypercapnic acidosis, potentially in combination with a malfunction of the gamma aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors in the brain. However, the existing empirical evidence testing these effects primarily stems from studies that exposed fish to elevated CO2 for a few days and measured a small number of traits. We investigated a range of energetic traits in juvenile spiny chromis damselfish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus) over 3months of acclimation to projected end-of-century CO2 levels (similar to 1000 mu atm). Somatic growth and otolith size and shape were unaffected by the CO2 treatment across 3months of development in comparison with control fish (similar to 420 mu atm). Swimming activity during behavioural assays was initially higher in the elevated CO2 group, but this effect dissipated within similar to 25min following handling. The transient higher activity of fish under elevated CO2 was not associated with a detectable difference in the rate of oxygen uptake nor was it mediated by GABA(A) neurotransmitter interference because treatment with a GABA(A) antagonist (gabazine) did not abolish the CO2 treatment effect. These findings contrast with several short-term studies by suggesting that end-of-century levels of CO2 may have negligible direct effects on the energetics of at least some species of fish.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s00442-019-04430-z</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210237</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">In silico identification of bacterial seaweed-degrading bioplastic producers</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">There is an urgent need to replace petroleum-based plastic with bio-based and biodegradable alternatives. Polyhydroxyal-kanoates (PHAs) are attractive prospective replacements that exhibit desirable mechanical properties and are recyclable and biodegradable in terrestrial and marine environments. However, the production costs today still limit the economic sustainability of the PHA industry. Seaweed cultivation represents an opportunity for carbon capture, while also supplying a sustainable photosynthetic feedstock for PHA production. We mined existing gene and protein databases to identify bacteria able to grow and produce PHAs using seaweed-derived carbohydrates as substrates. There were no significant relationships between the genes involved in the deconstruction of algae polysaccharides and PHA production, with poor to negative correlations and diffused clustering suggesting evolutionary compartmentalism. We identified 2987 bacterial candidates spanning 40 taxonomic families predominantly within Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Burkholderiales with enriched seaweed-degrading capacity that also harbour PHA synthesis potential. These included highly promising candidates with specialist and generalist specificities, including Alteromonas, Aquisphaera, Azotobacter, Bacillus, Caulobacter, Cellvibrionaceae, Duganella, Janthinobacterium, Massilia, Oxalobacteraceae, Parvularcula, Pirellulaceae, Pseudomonas, Rhizobacter, Rhodanobacter, Simiduia, Sphingobium, Sphingomonadaceae, Sphingomonas, Stieleria, Vibrio and Xanthomonas. In this enriched subset, the family-level densities of genes targeting green macroalgae polysaccharides were considerably higher (n=231.6Â±68.5) than enzymes targeting brown (n=65.34Â±13.12) and red (n=30.5Â±10.72) polysaccharides. Within these organisms, an abundance of FabG genes was observed, suggesting that the fatty acid de novo synthesis pathway supplies (R)âˆ’3-hydroxyacyl-CoA or 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA from core metabolic processes and is the predominant mechanism of PHA production in these organisms. Our results facilitate extending seaweed biomass valorization in the context of consolidated biorefining for the production of bioplastics.

Since the onset of the industrial revolution the cumulative emissions have led to an increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration which corresponds to an additional radiative forcing in the atmosphere. Of the three reservoirs which exchange carbon on the time scale of centuries - atmosphere, terrestrial biosphere, and ocean - the ocean is by far the largest. The marine CO2 system comprises the chemical species HCO3-, CO2- 3, and CO2(aq). This gives rise to the pH-buffering nature of seawater as well as its high uptake capacity for anthropogenic CO 2. Four measurement parameters of the marine CO2 system are available for an accurate analytical characterization. These parameters also provide a means of sensing the role of physical, chemical, and biological drivers for the marine carbon cycle. The marine carbon cycle features major natural processes that exchange carbon with the atmosphere and re-distribute it throughout the ocean. These are known as "pumps" and driven by physical and biological factors. While the "physical pump" is inevitably enhanced by the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2, even the sign of the response is currently not clear for the "biological pumps". A host of potential consequences of global change (temperature rise, ocean carbonation, ocean acidification) have been identified. These are currently studied intensively with respect to their climate sensitivity as well as the climate feedback potential. Â© 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp;amp; Co.

Seaweeds, however, are also important drivers in the development of the blue bioeconomy due to their vast diversity of unique chemicals with a broad range of industrial and biotechnological applications. In tropical regions, seaweed production has been focused on a few species only, because of their hydrocolloids used in the food industry. There is a strong need to identify new applications of red seaweed species in other sectors such as aquaculture. Therefore, to diversify the culture of red seaweeds, more tropical species need to be investigated for their chemical composition and potential application in aquaculture, and then, to develop a method for a sustainable cultivation of new seaweed candidates and enhance their economic potential. Based on this context, we analyze the potential value of the red edible seaweed Acanthophora spp., an under-valued seaweed species which is naturally abundant in tropical countries, and Kappaphycus spp., a commercially valuable seaweed commonly used for polysaccharide extraction. The vast chemical diversity of seaweeds (polysaccharides, phytohormones, amino acids, and pigments) has led to research on a wide range of applications in aquaculture, including pathogen control, immunostimulant, antioxidant, bioremediation, feed, UV protectants, increase in seafood shelf life, animal colorant, and growth regulator for microalga culture. This review hopes to stimulate the interest among seaweed researchers to investigate other local seaweed species and seek greater added value of their biomass and chemical compounds and their applications in the aquaculture sector. Additionally, this information will help stakeholders to benefit from these two red seaweeds by contributing to the diversification of the blue bioeconomy in tropical countries.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3389/fmars.2022.957290</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210253</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The Impact of Alternative Fuels on Ship Engine Emissions and Aftertreatment Systems: A Review</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Marine engines often use diesel as an alternative fuel to improve the economy. In recent years, waste oil, biodiesel and alcohol fuel are the most famous research directions among the alternative fuels for diesel. With the rapid development of the shipping industry, the air of coastal areas is becoming increasingly polluted. It is now necessary to reduce the emission of marine engines to meet the strict emission regulations. There are many types of alternative fuels for diesel oil and the difference of the fuel may interfere with the engine emissions; however, PM, HC, CO and other emissions will have a negative impact on SCR catalyst. This paper reviews the alternative fuels such as alcohols, waste oils, biodiesel made from vegetable oil and animal oil, and then summarizes and analyzes the influence of different alternative fuels on engine emissions and pollutant formation mechanism. In addition, this paper also summarizes the methods that can effectively reduce the emissions of marine engines; it can provide a reference for the study of diesel alternative fuel and the reduction of marine engine emissions.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/catal12020138</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210255</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The development of a transdisciplinary policy framework for shipping companies to mitigate underwater noise pollution from commercial vessels</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">One of the newly emerging environmental issues is underwater noise pollution. It has both negative environmental and socio-economic impacts and threatens sustainable shipping. While other types of shipping pollutants have been regulated and societal awareness has been raised, due to the intangible characteristics of underwater noise pollution, there is neither societal awareness nor an international legally binding instrument to mitigate underwater noise pollution. This paper aims to raise awareness of ship owners regarding UWN pollution by introducing the sources of UWN pollution, as well as proposing a transdisciplinary policy for shipping companies to mitigate UWN pollution from their ships. The proposed policy is aligned with IMO's initial GHG strategy, especially the Energy Efficiency Design Index, Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index, and Enhanced Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan.

An enhancement of this slow natural process could remove substantial amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere, aiming to offset some unavoidable anthropogenic emissions in order to comply with the Paris Agreement, while at the same time it may decrease ocean acidification. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of economic costs, energy requirements, technical parameterization, and global and regional carbon removal potential. The crucial parameters defining this potential are the grain size and weathering rates. The main uncertainties about the potential relate to weathering rates and rock mass that can be integrated into the soil. The discussed results do not specifically address the enhancement of weathering through microbial processes, feedback of geogenic nutrient release, and bioturbation. We do not only assess dunite rock, predominantly bearing olivine (in the form of forsterite) as the mineral that has been previously proposed to be best suited for carbon removal, but focus also on basaltic rock to minimize potential negative side effects. Our results show that enhanced weathering is an option for carbon dioxide removal that could be competitive already at 60 US $ t-1 CO2 removed for dunite, but only at 200 US $ t-1 CO2 removed for basalt. The potential carbon removal on cropland areas could be as large as 95 Gt CO2 a-1 for dunite and 4.9 Gt CO2 a-1 for basalt. The best suited locations are warm and humid areas, particularly in India, Brazil, South-East Asia and China, where almost 75% of the global potential can be realized. This work presents a techno-economic assessment framework, which also allows for the incorporation of further processes. Â© 2018 The Author(s).

This study aimed to develop additive biomass models for Heritiera fomes, the most dominant tree species of the Sundarbans Reserved Forest in Bangladesh. Using a non-destructive method, 219 small branches (diameter &lt; 7 cm) were harvested from 97 individual trees to develop biomass models for leaves and smaller branches. The biomass of bigger branches (diameter > 7 cm) and stem was calculated from the volume and mean wood density value after debarking while the biomass of all other components was derived from the determined fresh to oven dry weight conversion ratio. Finally, the biomass of one individual tree was calculated by adding the biomass of trimmed and untrimmed leaves, small and large branches, foliage and stem. An independent data set was used to validate the best-fit model. A component-wise (leaves, branches, bark and stem) biomass model was developed by recovering subsequent cross-component correlations which were then aggregated using the weighted Gaussian maximum likelihood estimation method. Among the components model, D (diameter at breast height) alone performed best for leaves and branches while the product of D and H (total tree height) proved the better results for stem and bark. Our best-fit model (Biomass = 0.0389D(2.3773) H-0.4178 + 0.0492D(2.3027) + 0.0112D(1.1144) H-1.4572 + 0.0306D(1.8507)) showed the highest model efficiency with the lowest AIC, RMSE\%, MAE, and MPE values. The efficiency of our non-destructive model has shown that it is as effective as other widely used pan-tropical models. Our built models can therefore be used for accurate estimation of biomass and carbon stock in H. fomes of the Sundarbans Reserved Forest, Bangladesh.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.2989/20702620.2021.1934180</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210281</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Total life cycle emissions of post-Panamax containerships powered by conventional fuel or natural gas</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">This study proposes an easy-to-apply method, the Total Life Cycle Emission Model (TLCEM), to calculate the total emissions from shipping and help ship management groups assess the impact on emissions caused by their capital investment or operation decisions. Using TLCEM, we present the total emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs) during the 25-yr life cycle of 10 post-Panamax containerships under slow steaming conditions. The life cycle consists of steel production, shipbuilding, crude oil extraction and transportation, fuel refining, bunkering, and ship operation. We calculate total emissions from containerships and compare the effect of emission reduction by using various fuels. The results can be used to differentiate the emissions from various processes and to assess the effectiveness of various reduction approaches. Critical pollutants and GHGs emitted from each process are calculated. If the containerships use heavy fuel oil (HFO), emissions of CO2 total 2.79 million tonnes (Mt), accounting for 95.37\% of total emissions, followed by NOx and SOx emissions,which account for 2.25\% and 1.30\%, respectively.The most significant emissions are from the operation of the ship and originate from the main engine (ME).When fuel is switched to 100\% natural gas (NG), SOx, PM10, and CO2 emissions show remarkable reductions of 98.60\%, 99.06\%, and 21.70\%, respectively. Determining the emission factor of each process is critical for estimating the total emissions. The estimated emission factors were compared with the values adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).The proposed TLCEM may contribute to more accurate estimates of total life cycle emissions from global shipping.Implications: We propose a total life cycle emissions model for 10 post-Panamax container ships. Using heavy fuel oil, emissions of CO2 total 2.79 Mt, accounting for approximately 95\% of emissions, followed by NOx and SOx emissions. Using 100\% natural gas, SOx, PM10, and CO2 emissions reduce by 98.6\%, 99.1\%, and 21.7\%, respectively. NOx emissions increase by 1.14\% when running a dual fuel engine at low load in natural gas mode.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1080/10962247.2018.1505675</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210284</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Desalination technology waste streams: Effect of pH and salinity on metabolism of marine microbial assemblages</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Effluents from desalination technologies may influence natural bacterial assemblages due to changes in salinity, pH, dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC), DOC quality and cellular hydrostatic pressure. Salinity, pH, and pressure change effects on heterotrophic bacterial production (as measured by leucine incorporation) were examined in experiments with surface water from the Delaware Bay, Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean. Bacterial production decreased by 57-67\% when salinity of Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay surface water samples were increased from ambient to 60 PSU. Decreasing ambient seawater pH from 8.0 to below 5.0 with CO2 gas reduced production by 96-100\%. Decreasing seawater pH by 1.5 units at 33 PSU caused equivalent inhibition to increasing salinity by 27 PSU (pH 8.0). Bacterial production in Pacific Ocean surface water pressurized for 72 h was decreased 40\% by increasing salinity, when measured I h after decompression. However, production increased 43\% with increasing salinity when, measured 24 h after decompression. One explanation for these divergent effects between the 1- and 24-h sampling at ambient pH may be community adaptation. Strains amongst the natural assemblage that survived the pressurization by saturating their membrane phospholipids would likely be better adapted to compete for available nutrients under elevated salinity.

Currently, the two most commonly used ship emission assessment methods sit on opposite ends of the spectrum â€“ the top-down approach, which provides low resolution yet efficient aggregated results however is unable to account for specific shipping activities, and the bottom-up vessel-by-vessel approach, which provides near-instantaneous ship emissions production at a high resolution â€“ yet is data and time intensive. To address the market gap for a ship greenhouse emission estimation method that hybridises the best of both the bottom-up and top-down methods the novel Ship Emissions Assessment (SEA) method is proposed as an innovative hybrid solution. It is a cost effective and resource efficient method, presenting spatial ship emissions utilising widely accessible data, and it is precise â€“ fulfilling the requirements needed to evaluate ship emissions reduction measures. Novel SEA method is the first in its endeavour to replace Automatic Identification System (AIS) Vessel-based raw data allocation, by using rapid analyses of readily available ship track density data and average voyage information. It combines obtained average voyage distance with voyage average speed to estimate ship activity for emission assessments - saving costs by reducing time and reliance on complex computations, especially when many ships need to be analysed simultaneously. Using the novel SEA method, a series of containerships from geographically diverse ports were sampled and assessed for emissions with comparative results confirming the representations equivalent to the detailed and data demanding bottom-up method. Subsequently, the novel SEA method was applied to containership traffic calling into the Port of Trieste, in the northern Adriatic Sea, where it demonstrated the ability to estimate and quantify historic emissions for the preceding 12 months while taking into account seasonal port traffic variations. The novel SEA method showed to be an efficient, inexpensive and accurate, easy-to-use emission assessment tool based on widely accessible data. It can be used in day-to-day shipping operations by a variety of stakeholders including port operations managers, regional traffic operators, and those non-industry, while providing the required level of technical accuracy. In comparison, existing methods are not as time and cost effective, user-friendly, nor based on easy to interpret and readily accessible data. The novel SEA method enables further global research of ship emissions, and for regional and international policy makers to effectively manage the measures needed to reach greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.

The village under study can stand for most fishing villages of the area of southern Moroccan coastline. Since these villages might not have easy access to the national electricity grid, their energy needs are ensured by highly polluting generators with high energy generation cost in the long term. One of the solutions for decreasing power systems energy cost in these villages is installation of hybrid energy systems. In order to comprehend the viability of such systems, a pilot site was chosen: Lamhiriz, a small village of 4625 inhabitants with an annual consumption of 1.3 GWh. The new power system investigated for Lamhiriz village is diesel-wind hybrid system with electrochemical and thermal storages. First, energy consumption and wind potential of Lamhiriz are presented, then it comes the design of the hybrid system that was approached in two ways: a first configuration of the hybrid system is obtained by economical simulation on HOMER software. In a second step, the sizing problem is solved as an optimization problem where we try to minimize the cost of energy generated by each element of the system in order to meet the electrical demand. Once the optimum sizing obtained, the appropriate energy management is chosen. The GAMS software was used to approach the optimal sizing and energy management. The results found by both HOMER and GAMS are compared in order to see the one meeting the expectations of an optimized system. Energy cost results brought by the optimized hybrid system is compared with energy cost brought by a conventional diesel system.

Changes in vegetation type and land use can affect organic matter inputs and soil properties. This work aimed to examine how these changes affected elemental stoichiometry and C-, N-, and P- associated enzyme activities and wetland soil organic C stock. We quantified organic C concentrations, and stoichiometric ratios of C, N, and P in total and microbial biomass pools, along with the activities and ratios of C-, N-, and P-associated enzymes for soils of natural coastal wetlands with different vegetation types, namely Melaleuca wetland (Melaleuca spp), mangrove forests (Bruguiera spp), and saline marsh (Eleocharis spp). We also compared these natural wetlands to an adjacent sugarcane plantation to understand the effects of vegetation types. Hypothesis-oriented path analysis was used to explore links between these variables and soil organic C stocks. Tidal forested soils (0â€“30 cm) had the highest organic C, N, and P contents and potential activities of C-, N-, P- acquiring enzymes, compared with other vegetation types. Mangroves soils had the highest total soil C:N and microbial biomass C:P ratios. Microbial biomass C:P ratios were significantly and positively related to total C:P, while microbial biomass N:P ratios were positively associated with total soil C:P and N:P ratios. Path analysis suggested that soil organic C stock was largely explained by total C:P ratio, microbial biomass N:P ratios, total P content, and the ratio of C- and P-associated enzymes. Different types of wetlands have different soil properties and enzymatic activities, implying their different capacity to store and process C and N. The resource quality and stoichiometry direct influence the organic C stock.

The ecosystem service (mitigation of climatic change) was quantified and mapped on a wide scale in Carmen Island, Campeche, Mexico by using geo-statistics methods. Carbon sequestration rate and several important physicochemical parameters on a wide scale in the city were determined at 30 cm depth, which is the most relevant depth affected by land management practices. An evident seasonal pattern was observed for organic carbon, exhibiting its highest levels at the beginning of the dry season. In addition, a geographical distribution analysis identified mangrove and flooded sites as those zones in which carbon storage was higher, concluding that hydrogeology and dominant vegetation were the factors with a greater influence on carbon storage rate. Carbon storage rate obtained in this work (1.07 Kg C m(-2) yr(-1)) was comparable with those obtained for isolated and forested wetlands in others regions of the world. This study is the first in the region that provides a high-resolution map of soil carbon stocks in a mixed and complex frame where an important urban zone and mangrove forest co-exist.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.2495/SC160351</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210306</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Sensitivity of simulated CO2 concentration to regridding of global fossil fuel CO2 emissions</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Errors in the specification or utilization of fossil fuel CO2 emissions within carbon budget or atmospheric CO2 inverse studies can alias the estimation of biospheric and oceanic carbon exchange. A key component in the simulation of CO2 concentrations arising from fossil fuel emissions is the spatial distribution of the emission near coastlines. Regridding of fossil fuel CO2 emissions (FFCO2) from fine to coarse grids to enable atmospheric transport simulations can give rise to mismatches between the emissions and simulated atmospheric dynamics which differ over land or water. For example, emissions originally emanating from the land are emitted from a grid cell for which the vertical mixing reflects the roughness and/or surface energy exchange of an ocean surface. We test this potential ``dynamical inconsistency{''} by examining simulated global atmospheric CO2 concentration driven by two different approaches to regridding fossil fuel CO2 emissions. The two approaches are as follows: (1) a commonly used method that allocates emissions to grid cells with no attempt to ensure dynamical consistency with atmospheric transport and (2) an improved method that reallocates emissions to grid cells to ensure dynamically consistent results. Results show large spatial and temporal differences in the simulated CO2 concentration when comparing these two approaches. The emissions difference ranges from -30.3 TgC grid cell(-1) yr(-1) (3.39 kgCm(-2) yr(-1)) to +30.0 TgC grid cell(-1) yr(-1) (+2.6 kgCm(-2) yr(-1)) along coastal margins. Maximum simulated annual mean CO2 concentration differences at the surface exceed +/- 6 ppm at various locations and times. Examination of the current CO2 monitoring locations during the local afternoon, consistent with inversion modeling system sampling and measurement protocols, finds maximum hourly differences at 38 stations exceed +/- 0.10 ppm with individual station differences exceeding 32 ppm. The differences implied by not accounting for this dynamical consistency problem are largest at monitoring sites proximal to large coastal urban areas and point sources. These results suggest that studies comparing simulated to observed atmospheric CO2 concentration, such as atmospheric CO2 inversions, must take measures to correct for this potential problem and ensure flux and dynamical consistency.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.5194/gmd-7-2867-2014</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210310</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Energy, Economic and Environmental Effects of the Marine Diesel Engine Trigeneration Energy Systems</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The paper discusses the possibility of applying the trigeneration energy concept (cogeneration + absorption cooling) on diesel-powered refrigerated ships, based on systematic analyses of variable energy loads during the estimated life of the ship on a predefined navigation route.

Special emphasis is placed on the assessment of the upcoming total heat loads (refrigeration and heating) in live cargo air conditioning systems (unfrozen fruits and vegetables) as in ship accommodations. The obtained results indicate beneficiary energy, economic and environmental effects of the application of diesel engine trigeneration systems on ships intended for cargo transport whose storage temperatures range from -25 to 15 degrees C.

If the DC pooling scheme is adopted, there will be no reactive power consumption in the wind farm, and the power flow will depend on the DC voltage distribution of the DC pooling network. There is an essential difference between the operation control strategy and the AC pooling, which will solve the reactive voltage stability of the wind farm, and reduce wind farm construction and operating costs, improving operational efficiency. DC aggregation network technology is not only a concern of DC technical workers, but also a problem that other large inland wind farms and offshore wind farms need to study. It can be seen that the research on the DC networking technology scheme of large-scale renewable energy power generation will have guiding significance for the development and utilization of renewable energy power generation in the power grid, promote the healthy development of renewable energy power generation and related industries, and be friendly to the construction of a strong smart grid, provides good technical support.

An advantage of this process is that a huge quantity of CO2 can be sequestrated and stored at relatively low pressure, which will reduce the amount of storage cost required for creating additional platform to store it. The study on CO2 storage in coal seam to enhance coal bed methane (ECBM) recovery has drawn a lot of attention for its worldwide suitability and acceptability and has been conducted since two decades in many coalmines. This article focuses on the coal seam properties related to CO2 adsorption/desorption, coal swelling/shrinkage, diffusion, porosity and permeability changes, thermodynamic/thermochemical process, flue gas injection, etc. Here, the performance analysis of both CO2 storage and ECBM recovery process in coal matrixes is investigated based on the numerical simulation. In this study, a one-dimensional mathematical model of defining mass balances is used to interpret the gas flow and the gas sorption and describe a geomechanical relationship for determining the porosity and the permeability alteration at the time of gas injection. Vital insights are inspected by considering the relevant gas flow dynamics during the displacement and the influences of coal swelling and shrinkage on the ECBM operation. In particular, pure CO2 causes more displacement that is more efficient in terms of total CH4 recovery, whereas the addition of N-2 to the mixture assists to make quicker way of the initial methane recovery. However, this study will support future research aspirants working on the same topic by providing a clear conception and limitation about this study.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s13202-020-00847-y</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210321</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Ocean acidification leads to counterproductive intestinal base loss in the gulf toadfish (Opsanus beta)</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Oceanic CO2 has increased from 280 to 380 Î¼atm since preindustrial times and is expected to reach 1,900 Î¼atm by 2300. In addition, regional upwelling zones exhibit levels up to 2,300 matm, making exploration at future global projected CO2 levels ecologically relevant today. Recent work has demonstrated that CO2 exposure as low as 1,000 Î¼atm induces acidosis in toadfish (Opansus beta), leading to metabolic compensation by retention of blood in an effort to defend pH. Since increaseHCO-3 serosal HCO-3 translates to increased HCO-3 secretion rates in isolated intestinal tissue, we predicted that blood elevation of and Pco2uring exposure to 1,900 Î¼atm CO2 HCO-3 would increase in vivo base secretion rates. Rectal fluid and CaCO3 excretions were collected from toadfish exposed to 380 (control) and 1,900 Î¼atm CO2 for 72 h. Fluids were analyzed for pH, osmolality, ionic composition, and total CO2. Precipitated CaCO3 was analyzed for titratable alkalinity, Mg2+, and Ca2+ content. Fish exposed to 1,900 Î¼atm CO2 exhibited higher rectal base excretion rates, higher rectal fluid HCO-3 (mmol L-1), and lower fluid Cl- (mmol L-1) than controls, suggesting increased intestinal anion exchange as a result of the compensated respiratory acidosis. This study verifies that imminent projected CO2 levels expected by the year 2300 lead to greater HCO-3 intestinal loss, a process that acts against compensation for a CO2- induced acidosis.

However, little is known about the interactive effects of warming, irradiance, and nutrients on physiology of marine macroalgae, which are dominant in coastal ecosystems. The present study examined the combined effects of warming (23 and 26 degrees C), irradiance (30 and 150 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)), and nutrients (enriched and non-enriched) on specific growth rate (SGR) and biochemical compositions of the canopy-forming marine macroalga Sargassum fusiforme. The negative effect of warming on SGR and ratio of chlorophyll (Chl) c to Chl a was antagonized by decreased irradiance. Moreover, the negative effect of temperature elevation on carbon content was antagonized by nutrient enrichment. These results suggest that the effect of warming on the growth and carbon accumulation of this species can be mitigated by decreased irradiance and nutrient enrichment.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/jmse10040479</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210335</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Eastport tidal power LLC; Notice of competing preliminary permit application accepted for filing and soliciting comments and motions to intervene</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">On 8/9/2010, Eastport Tidal Power LLC filed an application for a preliminary permit, pursuant to section 4(f) of the Federal Power Act (FPA), proposing to study the feasibility of the Half Moon Cove Tidal Power Plant Project to be located in Half Moon Cove and Cobscook Bay, Washington County, Maine.

Methods Leaf litter and/or seedlings of R. mangle were placed into 1-m(2) experimental plots in a Distichlis spicata-dominated salt marsh on the Atlantic Coast of central Florida (USA). An additional litter decomposition experiment was conducted in all plots by adding litter bags containing 10 g of dried D. spicata shoot litter. Seedling growth was measured yearly. One and four years after the start of the experiment, soil samples were collected to determine physical and chemical soil conditions, potential nitrification and denitrification activities and abundances of genes that are related to microbial processes in the nitrogen cycle. Results Growth of R. mangle seedlings was stimulated in the presence of R. mangle litter, while decomposition rates of D. spicata litter were lower in plots with R. mangle litter and seedlings. The presence of R. mangle litter and/or seedlings had no significant effect on potential nitrification and denitrification activities and on the abundances of genes. Conclusions The colonization of R. mangle into D. spicata-dominated salt marshes will affect the carbon cycle, but not necessarily the nitrogen cycle, which is likely due to the pre-existing nitrogen-limited conditions in the salt marsh.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s11104-018-3611-z</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210345</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Mangrove carbon and nutrient accumulation shifts driven by rapid development in a tropical estuarine system, northeast Brazil</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Mangrove environments are important for maintaining biodiversity and carbon cycling. However, these systems are being degraded at alarming rates around the world, particularly in rapidly developing regions. Here, we examine a sediment profile from a mangrove forest near a large port complex at Suape, northeast Brazil, in order to assess the impact of rapid urbanization and industrialization. We find that total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) accumulation rates have increased in the estuary since the 1980?s, directly related to rapid urban development. The TN and heavy 615N values in the sediment column suggest increasing anthropogenic influences. In contrast, heavy metal fluxes did not increase during these transitions. The increase in TOC and TN accumulation rates during the past four decades highlight the significant role mangrove areas play as sinks for anthropogenically enhanced nutrients in poorly-understood tropical areas.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112219</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210352</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">An in situ flow cell to highlight different mechanisms of calcium carbonate inhibition by green and non green polymers</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Antiscaling agents are widely used to prevent scale formation in the oil and gas industry because scale's presence can lead to unscheduled shutdown and deferred oil production. The main problems result from the formation of scale on equipment. It has been shown that the mechanism of scale formation differed according to the scale nucleation that occurred in the bulk solution or on a surface. The scope of this paper is to show, from experimental data, the effects of three different antiscalants on the growth rate of CaCO 3 formation on a metal surface. The choice of which inhibitors to study was based on a survey of the environmental regulations that can be encountered in different parts of the world. A conventional phosphorous inhibitor was used as a reference (polyphosphinocarboxylic acid, PPCA) and contrasted to the performance of two environmentally friendly inhibitors (polymaleic acid, PMA, and carboxymefhyl inulin, CMI). The use of an in situ flow cell coupled with a video assembly and a microscope permits the real-time visualization of crystal morphology. Studies included looking at the surface coverage of the calcareous deposit and the number of crystals of CaCO 3 formed. The effects of the scale inhibitors on the growth of calcium carbonate were studied after nucleation had occurred, in order to determine the effects of the inhibitors on calcium carbonate crystals already formed. A previous study was focused on the assessment of the inhibitors on the nucleation and growth steps. This paper is focused on the effects of the scale inhibitors on growing crystals which have been formed on a surface under uninhibited conditions. The morphology of the crystals was found to be modified by the three inhibitors studied but to different extents. The addition of 4 ppm of PPCA and PMA significantly decreased the growth rate of the calcium carbonate crystals but the CMI did not modify it at the concentration range tested. This technique demonstrates that the efficiencies of scale inhibitors can vary according to the step in which the antiscalants were added (nucleation/growth).

As such, assessment of storage potential and containment risk is required across many types of subsurface opportunities (including depleted fields and saline aquifers). In particular, the assessment of containment risk can be a daunting task, as it requires rock property calibration of heterogeneous intervals that are usually poorly sampled. The sequence-stratigraphic method is applied here using two case studies to illustrate how it can be utilized to articulate containment potential and risk for storage of immiscible supercritical Carbon dioxide at basin-to-prospect scales. In the onshore case studies presented here, facies dominated by (detrital) clay-mineral aggregates provide the most consistent excellent seals capable of retaining in excess of 200 m Carbon dioxide plume heights. Perhaps contrary to held paradigms, more distal basinal facies tend to be more inconsistent seals, due to a dominance of biogenic depositional components and complex diagenetic alterations. In the case studies, thick successions of argillaceous mudstones are typically associated with transgressive to early-highstand retreating to aggrading muddy clinoform deposits. These clinoform deposits can be shore (delta) attached or represent more distal offshore contourite mudbelts. In addition to the broad sequence-stratigraphic setting of appropriate lithofacies, the combination of basin type and sediment delivery will govern the geometry and lateral extend of favourable top seal deposits. Continental-crust foreland basins may develop favourable accumulations across thousands of square kilometres, whereas failed basins tend to exhibit much narrower facies belts. Finally, while perhaps logistically challenged, continental slope to basin-floor post-rift sediments of passive margins connected to large river input systems provide broad and thick favourable mud facies belts over distributive reservoir deposits.

Biochars were made from rapeseed, whitewood, and seaweed (Laminaria Digitata), produced via hydrothermal conversion, pyrolysis, and torrefaction. Adsorption kinetic models were developed for each biochar at different temperatures, pH and initial dye concentrations. Relatively high levels of methylene blue adsorption capacity were achieved by seaweed-based biochars (similar to 150 mg/g), with reasonable levels for rapeseed-based biochars (similar to 60 mg/g), whilst adsorption levels were found to be relatively low for whitewood-based biochars (&lt; 30 mg/g). A Pseudo-second-order kinetic model provided the best fit with experimental results. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm showed a better fit for seaweed biochars, while the Freundlich adsorption isotherm was a better fit for the rapeseed-based biochars. The Langmuir adsorption isotherms showed relatively high maximum adsorption capacity (Qo) for seaweed-based biochars; similar to 175 mg/g for seaweed-Torrefaction and similar to 117 mg/g for seaweed-Pyrolysis. Negative Gibbs free energy (delta G degrees) values were observed for the seaweed-Torrefaction &lt; seaweed-Pyrolysis &lt; 0, which indicates that the methylene blue removal could be a thermodynamically favourable process due to the spontaneous nature of the adsorption. Our investigation has shown that the removal of methylene blue from wastewater could be a potential application for seaweed-based biochars as part of a holistic whole life cycle valorisation pathway. However, it is not suitable for all types of biomasses which emphasises the need for tailoring unique valorisation pathways for different types of biomasses.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.fuel.2022.125428</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210368</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Sediment and terrestrial organic carbon budgets for the offshore Ayeyarwady Delta, Myanmar: Establishing a baseline for future change</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Large river deltas serve as globally important archives of terrestrial and shallow marine biogeochemical signatures and because of rapid sedimentation have the potential to impact global biogeochemical cycling. The Ayeyarwady Delta in Myanmar ranks as the world's third largest river delta in terms of sediment supply; however, modern increases in regional anthropogenic impacts risk severe alteration to sediment and TerrOC loads within this major system. By investigating modern sediment and terrestrial organic carbon (TerrOC) accumulation within the offshore Ayeyarwady Delta this study estimates baseline sediment and TerrOC budgets for this understudied mega-delta. Using 210Pb geochronology of 27 sediment cores collected from the continental shelf, we estimate that 405 (+52/-47) Mt of sediment, or ~70-80% of fluvial sediment discharged from the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin rivers (the main inputs to the delta), accumulates there annually. Sediment not retained on the shelf is likely partitioned between the Ayeyarwady floodplain, shoreline accretion, and minor deep-sea export. Estimates of TerrOC (based on Î´13C mixing models) were coupled with modern sediment accumulation rates to determine an annual burial of 1.93 (+1.09/-0.15) Mt C on the shelf, with TerrOC burial fluxes being highest in the foreset beds of the subaqueous delta, coincident with the area of highest sediment accumulation rate. Based on estimates of the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin rivers' TerrOC delivery, an apparent ~100% of TerrOC input is preserved on the continental shelf. However, an across shelf trend of increasing TerrOC degradation with distance offshore is also observed, indicating that while the shelf has high apparent TerrOC sequestration, carbon remineralization is also occurring prior to deposition within the subaqueous delta. Based on these conflicting outcomes, we suggest that input of TerrOC from additional sources other than the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin rivers roughly balance the observed carbon remineralization. Main additional sources of TerrOC include the Sittang and several smaller rivers, and the Ayeyarwady delta plain below the river gauging station. As anthropogenic development within the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin watersheds continues to increase, these sediment and TerrOC budgets provide a baseline from which future changes within the offshore Ayeyarwady Delta can be monitored.

Seagrass and adjacent unvegetated habitats growing at a low pH station (pH = 7.65 Â± 0.02) were compared with corresponding habitats at a control station (pH = 8.01 Â± 0.01). Density and biomass showed a clear decreasing trend at the low pH station and the below- to above-ground biomass ratio was more than 10 times lower compared to the control. C content and Î´13C of leaves and epiphytes were significantly lower at the low pH station. Photosynthetic activity of C. nodosa was stimulated by low pH as seen by the significant increase in Chla content of leaves, maximum electron transport rate and compensation irradiance. Seagrass community metabolism was intense at the low pH station, with significantly higher net community production, respiration and gross primary production than the control community, whereas metabolism of the unvegetated community did not differ between stations. Productivity was promoted by the low pH, but this was not translated into biomass, probably due to nutrient limitation, grazing or poor environmental conditions. The results indicate that seagrass response in naturally acidified conditions is dependable upon species and geochemical characteristics of the site and highlight the need for a better understanding of complex interactions in these environments.

Recent research demonstrates that the functional loss of predators could have far-reaching consequences on carbon cycling and, by implication, our ability to ameliorate climate change impacts. Yet the influence of predators on carbon accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats (that is, salt marshes, seagrass meadows and mangroves) is poorly understood, despite these being some of the Earth's most vulnerable and carbon-rich ecosystems. Here we discuss potential pathways by which trophic downgrading affects carbon capture, accumulation and preservation in vegetated coastal habitats. We identify an urgent need for further research on the influence of predators on carbon cycling in vegetated coastal habitats, and ultimately the role that these systems play in climate change mitigation. There is, however, sufficient evidence to suggest that intact predator populations are critical to maintaining or growing reserves of `blue carbon' (carbon stored in coastal or marine ecosystems), and policy and management need to be improved to reflect these realities.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1038/NCLIMATE2763</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210381</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Nutrient Removal by Algae-Based Wastewater Treatment</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Algae cultivation complements wastewater treatment (WWT) principles as the process uptakes nutrients while assimilates CO2 into biomass. Thus, the application of algae-based WWT is on the upward trajectory as more attention for recovery nutrients and CO2 capture while reducing its economic challenge in the circular economy concept. However, the complexity of wastewater and algal ecological characteristics induces techno-economic challenges for industry implementation. Algae-based WWT relies totally on the ability of algae to uptake and store nutrients in the biomass. Therefore, the removal efficiency is proportional to biomass productivity. This removal mechanism limits algae applications to low nutrient concentration wastewater. The hydraulic retention time (HRT) of algae-based WWT is significantly long (i.e. > 10 days), compared to a few hours in bacteria-based process. Phototrophic algae are the most used process in algae-based WWT studies as well as in pilot-scale trials. Application of phototrophic algae in wastewater faces challenges to supply CO2 and illumination. Collectively, significant landscape is required for illumination. Algae-based WWT has limited organic removals, which require pretreatment of wastewaters before flowing into the algal process. Algae-based WWT can be used in connection with the bacteria-based WWT to remove partial nutrients while capturing CO2. Future research should strive to achieve fast and high growth rate, strong environmental tolerance species, and simple downstream processing and high-value biomass. There is also a clear and urgent need for more systematic analysis of biomass for both carbon credit assessment and economic values to facilitate identification and prioritisation of barriers to lower the cost algae-based WWT.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s40726-022-00230-x</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210386</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Proposed Inland Oil Tanker Design in Bangladesh Focusing CO2 Emission Reduction Based on Revised EEDI Parameters</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Though inland ships account for a small portion of the total global CO(2)emissions from shipping, from the individual country's economic and environmental perspective, this is very important. To reduce CO2 emissions from sea-going ships by increasing energy efficiency, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted a generalized Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) in 2011. However, due to the variation in environmental, geographic and economic conditions, a generalized EEDI cannot be established in a similar fashion to that established by IMO. Shallow and restricted water effects, different fuel qualities (to reduce operational cost), increase in engine power requirements, reduction in carrying capacity, cargo availability, etc. make the EEDI by IMO inadequate for inland waterways. Therefore, an EEDI formulation based on revised parameters has been proposed for the inland ships in Bangladesh. This paper focuses on the possibility of CO2 emissions reduction from inland oil tankers in Bangladesh by implementing the revised EEDI formulation (henceforth denoted as EEDIINLAND). A sensitivity analysis was performed for the different ship design parameters of those oil tankers. Based on the analysis, suggestions were made on how to design inland oil tankers in Bangladesh using the revised EEDI formulation for reducing CO2 from the current level without any major cost involvement. Keeping the same speed and capacity, the vessels were redesigned based on those suggestions. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of those redesigned vessels using `Shipflow' showed a reduction in CO2 emissions through increasing EEDI(INLAND)by 7.54-13.65\%.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/jmse8090658</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210391</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The impact of remineralization depth on the air-sea carbon balance</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">As particulate organic carbon rains down from the surface ocean it is respired back to carbon dioxide and released into the ocean's interior. The depth at which this sinking carbon is converted back to carbon dioxide-known as the remineralization depth-depends on the balance between particle sinking speeds and their rate of decay. A host of climate-sensitive factors can affect this balance, including temperature(1), oxygen concentration(2), stratification, community composition(3,4) and the mineral content of the sinking particles(5). Here we use a three-dimensional global ocean biogeochemistry model to show that a modest change in remineralization depth can have a substantial impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. For example, when the depth at which 63\% of sinking carbon is respired increases by 24 m globally, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall by 10-27 ppm. This reduction in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration results from the redistribution of remineralized carbon from intermediate waters to bottom waters. As a consequence of the reduced concentration of respired carbon in upper ocean waters, atmospheric carbon dioxide is preferentially stored in newly formed North Atlantic Deep Water. We suggest that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are highly sensitive to the potential changes in remineralization depth that may be caused by climate change.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1038/NGEO612</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210394</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Carbon capture and storage for long-term and safe sealing with constrained natural CO2 analogs</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Carbon capture and storage for long-term sealing is one of the most promising approaches to mitigate global climate change. However, maximum capture amount and long-term safety of carbon dioxide storage in geological scenarios must be ensured. A case of a natural CO2 storage analog of the Huangqiao CO2-oil reservoir in the northern Jiangsu Basin, eastern China, is presented that can safely preserve carbon for millions of years, despite the mantle CO2-rich fluid having substantially altered the sandstone reservoirs. The calcite in the sandstone was significantly reduced by dissolution, thereby improving the CO2 storage capacity. Meanwhile, the mantle CO2-rich fluid advanced the precipitated calcite cement in the fractures of the mudstone caprock as it migrated upward, serving to self-seal the fractures and enhance the sealing capacity of CO2 storage. We numerically simulated artificial CO2 injection for 30 years in the depleted oil reservoir of Jurong near the Huangqiao CO2-oil reservoir; the maximum amount of CO2 injected into a single well can reach 5.43 x 106 t and increase the formation pressure by up to 95 bar. After injection, the saturation of gas-phase CO2 did not decrease remarkably over the following 300 years. No projected rapid CO2 leaked through fractures, owing to the selfsealing of fractures through calcite cement. This suggests that the depleted petroleum reservoir with an assemblage of sandstone reservoirs and overlying mudstone caprocks could be suitable for long-term and safe carbon capture and storage in geological formations.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.rser.2022.113000</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210395</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Low carbon electricity systems for Great Britain in 2050: An energy-land-water perspective</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The decarbonisation of the power sector is key to achieving the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global mean surface temperature rise to well below 2 Â°C. This will require rapid, national level transitions to low carbon electricity generation, such as variable renewables (VRE), nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage, across the world. At the same time it is essential that future power systems are sustainable in the wider sense and thus respect social, environmental and technical limitations. Here we develop an energy-land-water nexus modelling framework and use it to perform a scenario analysis with the aim of understanding the planning and operational implications of these constraints on Great Britain's (GB) power system in 2050. We consider plausible scenarios for limits on installed nuclear capacity, siting restrictions that shape VRE deployment and water use for thermal power station cooling. We find that these factors combined can lead to up to a 25% increase in the system's levelised cost of electricity (LCOE). VRE siting restrictions can result in an up to 13% increase in system LCOE as the deployment of onshore wind is limited while nuclear capacity restrictions can drive an up to 17% greater LCOE. We also show that such real-world limitations can cause substantial changes in system design both in terms of the spatial pattern of where generators are located and the capacity mix of the system. Thus we demonstrate the large impact simultaneously considering a set of nexus factors can have on future GB power systems. Finally, given our plausible assumptions about key energy-land-water restrictions and emission limits effecting the GB power system in 2050, the cost optimal penetration of VREs is found to be at least 50%.

Pertinent questions however need to be answered on the commercial viability of large scale production of biodiesel from microalgae. Vital steps need to be critically analysed at each stage. Isolation of microalgae should be based on the question of whether marine or freshwater microalgae, cultures from collections or indigenous wild types are best suited for large scale production. Furthermore, the determination of initial sampling points play a pivotal role in the determination of strain selection as well as strain viability. The screening process should identify, purify and select lipid producing strains. Are natural strains or stressed strains higher in lipid productivity? The synergistic interactions that occur naturally between algae and other microorganisms cannot be ignored. A lot of literature is available on the downstream processing of microalgae but a few reports are available on the upstream processing of microalgae for biomass and lipid production for biodiesel production. We present in this review an empirical and critical analysis on the potential of translating research findings from laboratory scale trials to full scale application. The move from laboratory to large scale microalgal cultivation requires careful planning. It is imperative to do extensive pre-pilot demonstration trials and formulate a suitable trajectory for possible data extrapolation for large scale experimental designs. The pros and cons of the two widely used methods for growing microalgae by photobioreactors or open raceway ponds are discussed in detail. In addition, current methods for biomass harvesting and lipid extraction are critically evaluated. This would be novel approach to economical biodiesel production from microalgae in the near future. Globally, microalgae are largest biomass producers having higher neutral lipid content outcompeting terrestrial plants for biofuel production. However, the viscosities of microalgal oils are usually higher than that of petroleum diesel.

Mesocosms, experimental enclosures designed to approximate natural conditions, and in which environmental factors can be manipulated and closely monitored, provide a powerful tool to close the gap between small-scale laboratory experiments and observational and correlative approaches applied in field surveys. Existing pelagic mesocosm systems are stationary and/or restricted to well-protected waters. To allow mesocosm experimentation in a range of hydrographic conditions and in areas considered most sensitive to ocean change, we developed a mobile sea-going mesocosm facility, the Kiel Off-Shore Mesocosms for Future Ocean Simulations (KOSMOS). The KOSMOS platform, which can be transported and deployed by mid-sized research vessels, is designed for operation in moored and free-floating mode under low to moderate wave conditions (up to 2.5m wave heights). It encloses a water column 2m in diameter and 15 to 25m deep (similar to 50-75 m(3) in volume) without disrupting the vertical structure or disturbing the enclosed plankton community. Several new developments in mesocosm design and operation were implemented to (i) minimize differences in starting conditions between mesocosms, (ii) allow for extended experimental duration, (iii) precisely determine the mesocosm volume, (iv) determine air-sea gas exchange, and (v) perform mass balance calculations. After multiple test runs in the Baltic Sea, which resulted in continuous improvement of the design and handling, the KOSMOS platform successfully completed its first full-scale experiment in the high Arctic off Svalbard (78 degrees 56.2'N, 11 degrees 53.6'E) in June/July 2010. The study, which was conducted in the framework of the European Project on Ocean Acidification (EPOCA), focused on the effects of ocean acidification on a natural plankton community and its impacts on biogeochemical cycling and air-sea exchange of climate-relevant gases. This manuscript describes the mesocosm hardware, its deployment and handling, CO2 manipulation, sampling and cleaning, including some further modifications conducted based on the experiences gained during this study.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.5194/bg-10-1835-2013</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210402</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Baja California Sur mangrove deep peat microbial communities cycle nitrogen but do not affect old carbon pool</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Mangroves provide important ecosystem services, including storing carbon belowground for millennia. Mangrove carbon storage relies in part on high primary productivity, but essential to the long-lived nature of this storage is the slow rate of microbial decomposition of peat. In this study, we (1) examined how carbon and nitrogen densities and microbial community composition vary with peat age and (2) describe the formation of peat deposits over time. At 4 mangrove sites near La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico, we cored the sediments until rejection and obtained 5 cm samples at 20 cm intervals. In these samples, we measured organic carbon (Corg), total nitrogen, Î´13C, Î´15N, and radiocarbon (14C) age. We observed peat carbon densities of 3.4 Ã— 10-2 Â± 0.2 Ã— 10-2 g cm-3, Corg:N ratios of 42 Â± 3, and inter-site variation in Corg:N that reflects differing preservation conditions. Recalcitrant organic matter sources and anaerobic conditions leave a strong imprint on peat microbial communities. Microbial community composition and diversity were driven by depth and sediment characteristics, including Corg:N ratio and 14C age. Carbon dating allowed us to reconstruct the accumulation of organic matter over the last 5029 Â± 85 yr. Even over this long time scale, though microbes have evidently continuously cycled the peat nitrogen pool, peat carbon density remains effectively unchanged.

Understanding the trends in in situ microbial community abundance, metabolism and carbon sources is therefore a crucial component of effective site management. The focus of this study was to use radiocarbon analysis to elucidate the carbon sources driving microbial metabolism within the first pilot Wetland reclamation project in the Alberta oil sands region where the observation of H2S had indicated the occurrence of microbial sulphate reduction. The reclamation project involved construction of a three compartment system consisting of a freshwater wetland on top of a sand cap overlying a composite tailings (CT) deposit. Radiocarbon analysis demonstrated that both dissolved and sediment associated organic carbon associated with the deepest compartments (the CF and sand cap) was primarily fossil (Delta C-14 = -769 to -955 parts per thousand) while organic carbon in the overlying peat was hundreds to thousands of years old (Delta C-14 = -250 to -350 parts per thousand). Radiocarbon contents of sediment associated microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were consistent with the sediment bulk organic carbon pools (Peat: Delta C-14(PLFA) = 257 parts per thousand; Sand cap Delta C-14(PLFA) = -805 parts per thousand) indicating that these microbes were using sediment associated carbon. In contrast, microbial PLFA grown on biofilm units installed in wells within the deepest compartments contained much more modern carbon that the associated bulk carbon pools. This implied that the transfer of relatively more modern carbon was stimulating the microbial community at depth within the system. Correlation between cellular abundance estimates based on PLFA concentrations and the Delta C-14(PLFA) indicated that the utilization of this more modern carbon was stimulating the microbial community at depth. These results highlight the importance of understanding the occurrence and potential outcomes of the introduction of relatively bioavailable carbon to mine wastes in order to predict and manage the performance of reclamation strategies.

Marine carbon burial represents the dominant natural mechanism of long-term organic carbon sequestration1,2. Fjords-deep, glacially carved estuaries at high latitudes-have been hypothesized to be hotspots of organic carbon burial, because they receive high rates of organic material fluxes from the watershed3. Here we compile organic carbon concentrations from 573 fjord surface sediment samples and 124 sediment cores from nearly all fjord systems globally. We use sediment organic carbon content and sediment delivery rates to calculate rates of organic carbon burial in fjord systems across the globe. We estimate that about 18 Mt of organic carbon are buried in fjord sediments each year, equivalent to 11% of annual marine carbon burial globally4. Per unit area, fjord organic carbon burial rates are one hundred times as large as the global ocean average, and fjord sediments contain twice as much organic carbon as biogenous sediments underlying the upwelling regions of the ocean1. We conclude that fjords may play an important role in climate regulation on glacial-interglacial timescales. Â© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

First, three forms of renewable sources for electric power generation (wind, solar, and tidal) are reviewed to show their intermittent characteristics. Second, the challenge resulting from high penetration of variable renewable power generation is discussed. Flexibility in the power grid is thus required for balancing electricity supply and demand. Third, the integration of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with renewable power generation technologies is investigated to show how SOFCs could support the transition to a low-carbon power system. SOFCs have the potential to contribute to achieving a low-carbon power system. This contribution is mainly implemented via two ways: (1) to generate electricity using renewable gases such as hydrogen or biogas and (2) to provide flexibility to the power grid such as through ancillary services. This flexibility is able to facilitate the large-scale integration of renewable power generation technologies in power systems. SOFCs can also play a role as backup generation for local energy systems. Â© 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Direct seawater electrolysis is the most established technology, attaining high current densities in the order of 1â€“2 A cmâˆ’2. Alternatively, light-driven processes such as photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical seawater splitting are particularly promising as well, as they rely on renewable solar power. Solar-to-Hydrogen efficiencies have increased over the past decade from negligible values to about 2%. Especially the absence of large local pH changes (in the order of several tenths of a pH unit compared to up to 9 pH units for electrolysis) is a strong asset for pure photocatalysis. This may lead to less adverse side-reactions such as Cl2 and ClOâˆ’ formation, (acid or base induced) corrosion and scaling. Besides, additional requirements for electrolytic cells, e.g. membranes and electricity input, are not needed in pure photocatalysis systems. In this review, the state-of-the-art technologies in light-driven seawater splitting are compared to electrochemical approaches with a focus on sustainability and stability. Promising advances are identified at the level of the catalyst as well as the process, and insight is provided in solutions crossing different fields.

As the potential for VRE is distributed unevenly across Europe, a Europe-wide cost optimal expansion of VRE will lead to different national and regional expansion rates of VRE. To facilitate such a Europe-wide cost optimal expansion of VRE a fair cost distribution among all European countries is needed. Therefore, we analyse and discuss how expected future decreases in investment costs for selected VRE (photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, wind onshore, and wind offshore) will affect the pan-European and national electricity systems. This is done by comparing three cost scenarios with a reference case, calculated using a European electricity system model. Our results show that the assumed cost reductions lead to an especially pronounced increase of PV distributed unevenly across Europe. In addition, higher shares of VRE show the effect of shifting electricity exchange patterns throughout Europe which also reduce cost benefits for economies of electricity exporting countries. Hence, there might be a lack of agreement in Europe about where and how to expand and integrate VRE if costs of expanding and integrating VRE are not distributed in a fair way between the European countries. In addition, these possible barriers of expanding VRE Europe-wide in a cost-optimal way might hinder the exploitation of cost synergies or even slow down VRE expansion on a European scale.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.esr.2018.04.007</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210421</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">GMS develops underwater ROV</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The creators of a new underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) claim almost any problem with the device can be repaired in less than 20 minutes.

For example, certain cables are held in place with two connectors rather than one so they can be removed without having to take the device apart further. The Predator is specifically designed to work in the difficult conditions associated with offshore wind farms. It has a high power-to-weight ratio to allow it to navigate strong currents and a number of integrated sensors to deal with low visibility. GMS is building five units to assist with the installation and repair of its cable laying and plans to use them on the planned London Array wind farm in the Thames Estuary and on a project in Asia. The unit is expected to sell for around Â£64,000.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210425</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Enhanced Lateral Exchange of Carbon and Nitrogen in a Coastal Wetland With Invasive Spartina alterniflora</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Lateral movements of materials and energy in coastal wetlands, due mainly to tidal activities, have been recognized as key processes in understanding the biogeochemical cycles of ecosystems. However, our understanding of the roles of lateral movement in shaping ecosystem functions remains limited. Here we quantified the effects of lateral sediment transport on total carbon (C, inorganic + organic) and nitrogen (N) pools in plants and soils in two dominant wetland types: invasive Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) marshes and native Phragmites australis (Phragmites) marshes in coastal Shanghai of the Yangtze Estuary. We found that the accreted sediments across the water-marsh gradients caused by lateral movement resulted in contrasting C and N contents between the two communities. The sediment load and C and N pools in the plants and soils of the Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those in the adjacent Phragmites marshes. The shifts in species composition and community structure not only altered the C and N balance but also enhanced the ecosystem net primary productivity. Our findings highlight the importance of lateral transport in altering ecosystem structure after Spartina invasion. The ecosystem C and N pools were significantly higher in the invaded ecosystems than in the native community. Our study also reveals that the plant density and structures can alter tidal hydrodynamics and the lateral transportations of sediments, which in turn influence ecosystem C and N cycle. The C accumulation processes of the native and invaded marshes were further complicated by the contrasting productivities of the ecosystems.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1029/2019JG005459</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210427</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Space sunshades and climate change</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The accelerated rate of increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations in recent years and the inability of humankind to move away from carbon-based energy system have led to the revival of the idea of counteracting global warming through geoengineering schemes. Two categories of geoengineering proposals have been suggested: solar radiation management (SRM) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods. SRM schemes would attempt to reduce the amount of solar radiation absorbed by our planet. Placing reflectors or mirrors in space, injecting aerosols into the stratosphere, and enhancing the albedo of marine clouds are some of the proposed SRM methods. In this section, the various space-based SRM methods which are likely to reduce the incoming solar radiation uniformly across the globe are discussed. In the past decade, the effects of these space sunshades on the climate system have been simulated using climate models by reducing the amount of incoming solar radiation by appropriate amounts (reduced solar constant). Key modeling results on the extent of global and regional climate change mitigation, unintended side effects, and unmitigated effects are briefly discussed.

Recently, field surveys on air-sea CO2 exchange have been conducted in various coastal seas to reveal the blue carbon function. In this study, we investigated the vertical distribution of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) system in the inner part of Osaka Bay to reveal the air-sea CO2 exchange characteristics in port and harbor area. Field surveys were conducted on a vertical seawall in Naruo-hama of Osaka Bay, Japan, during 12 months from November 2014 to October 2015 and during summer from August to September 2016. The vertical distributions of DIC and pH were measured on site, and the CO2 partial pressure in water (pCO(2w)) was calculated based on carbon acid equilibrium. Water temperature, salinity and DO were also measured to examine the relationships the vertical distribution of DIC system and water mass structure. Furthermore, the air-sea CO2 flux (F-CO2) was estimated to examine the characteristics of the air-sea CO2 exchange. DIC ranged from 787 to 2,111 mu mol kg(-1), with seasonal and vertical change. DIC in the bottom layer increased during high water temperature period due to CO2 production by respiration and decomposition, and DIC accumulated along with formation density stratification. The correlation between DIC and pCO(2w) in surface layer was smaller than that in bottom layer because surface pCO(2w) fluctuated due to inflow of river water or seawater mixing. This study area acts as CO2 sinks under calm conditions (F-CO2 = -3.4 mmol-C m(-2) d(-1)), however the site acts CO2 sources (1) when density stratification was relaxed (F-CO2 = 2.1 mmol-C m(-2) d(-1)); (2) when water was mixed by disturbance such as typhoon (F-CO2 = 1.3 mmol-C m(-2) d(-1)); and (3) when it rained (F-CO2 = 15.5 mmol-C m(-2) d(-1)).</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/978-981-15-0291-0</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210434</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Blue Carbon Stock of the Bangladesh Sundarban Mangroves: What could Be the Scenario after a Century?</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The total blue carbon stock of the Bangladesh Sundarban mangroves was evaluated and the probable future status after a century was predicted based on the recent trend of changes in the last 30 years and implementing a hybrid model of Markov Chain and Cellular automata. At present 36.24 Tg C and 54.95 Tg C are stored in the above-ground and below-ground compartments respectively resulting in total blue carbon stock of 91.19 Tg C. According to the prediction 15.88 Tg C would be lost from this region by the year 2115. The low saline species composition classes dominated mainly by Heritiera spp. accounts for the major portion of the carbon sock at present (45.60 Tg C), while the highly saline regions stores only 14.90 Tg C. The prediction shows that after a hundred years almost 22.42 Tg C would be lost from the low saline regions accompanied by an increase of 8.20 Tg C in the high saline regions dominated mainly by Excoecaria sp. and Avicennia spp. The net carbon loss would be due to both mangrove area loss (similar to 510 km(2)) and change in species composition leading to 58.28 Tg of potential CO2 emission within the year 2115.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s13157-016-0819-7</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210436</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Ship fuel consumption monitoring and fault detection via partial least squares and control charts of navigation data</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">New regulations in the shipping sector aim to give greater transparency to operations and public access to CO2 emissions data. EU regulation 2015/757 became mandatory in January 2018 and urges shipping companies to set up systems for daily monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of emissions for individual ships. Manual acquisition and handling of emissions data may be allowed (e.g. bunker fuel delivery note, bunker fuel tank monitoring), but is adversely affected by uncertainty due to human intervention and will eventually be unusable for monitoring purposes. However, the massive amounts of navigation data acquired by multi-sensor systems installed on-board of modern ships have great potential to aid compliance with regulations but their use is hampered by the lack of effective analytical methods in the maritime literature. This work demonstrates a statistical framework and automatic reporting system for fuel consumption monitoring that addresses the MRV requirements needed to comply with the regulations. The framework has been applied to the Grimaldi Group's Ro-Ro Pax cruise ships and is shown, in addition, to be capable of supporting fault detection as well as verifying CO2 savings achieved after energy efficiency initiatives.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.009</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210441</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Carbon stocks of intact mangroves and carbon emissions arising from their conversion in the Dominican Republic</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Mangroves are recognized to possess a variety of ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration and storage. Deforestation and conversion of these ecosystems continue to be high and have been predicted to result in significant carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Yet few studies have quantified the carbon stocks or losses associated with conversion of these ecosystems. In this study we quantified the ecosystem carbon stocks of three common mangrove types of the Caribbean as well as those of abandoned shrimp ponds in areas formerly occupied by mangrove-a common land-use conversion of mangroves throughout the world. In the mangroves of the Montecristi Province in Northwest Dominican Republic we found C stocks ranged from 706 to 1131 Mg/ha. The medium-statured mangroves (3-10 m in height) had the highest C stocks while the tall (&amp;gt;10 m) mangroves had the lowest ecosystem carbon storage. Carbon stocks of the low mangrove (shrub) type (&amp;lt;3 m) were relatively high due to the presence of carbon-rich soils as deep as 2 m. Carbon stocks of abandoned shrimp ponds were 95 Mg/ha or âˆ¼11% that of the mangroves. Using a stock-change approach, the potential emissions from the conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds ranged from 2244 to 3799 Mg CO2e/ha (CO2 equivalents). This is among the largest measured C emissions from land use in the tropics. The 6260 ha of mangroves and converted mangroves in the Montecristi Province are estimated to contain 3 841 490 Mg of C. Mangroves represented 76% of this area but currently store 97% of the carbon in this coastal wetland (3 696 722 Mg C). Converted lands store only 4% of the total ecosystem C (144 778 Mg C) while they comprised 24% of the area. By these metrics the replacement of mangroves with shrimp and salt ponds has resulted in estimated emissions from this region totaling 3.8 million Mg CO2e or âˆ¼21% of the total C prior to conversion. Given the high C stocks of mangroves, the high emissions from their conversion, and the other important functions and services they provide, their inclusion in climate-change mitigation strategies is warranted.

Improved peatland management - including a national moratorium on the granting of any new conversion licenses - forms a cornerstone of Indonesia's climate change mitigation commitment. At the same time, rapid expansion of the plantation sector is driving wide-scale drainage and conversion of peat swamp ecosystems. The province of Riau, in central Sumatra, finds itself at the crossroads of these conflicting agendas. This essay presents a case study of three islands on Riau's east coast affected by industrial timber plantation concessions. It examines the divergent experiences, perceptions and responses of communities on the islands. A mix of dramatic protests, localised everyday actions and constructive dialogue has succeeded in delaying or perhaps halting one of the concessions, while negotiations and contestation with the other two continue. With the support of regional and national non-governmental organisations and local government, communities are pursuing alternative development strategies, including the cultivation of sago, which requires no peat drainage. While a powerful political economy of state and corporate actors shapes the contours of socio-environmental change, local social movements can alter trajectories of change, promoting incremental improvements and alternative pathways.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1111/apv.12045</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210449</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Development of a novel kinetic hydrate inhibitor and corrosion inhibitor package for wet gas application</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">A dual functional kinetic hydrate inhibitor (KHI) and compatible corrosion inhibitor (CI) package was developed to simplify production chemistry demands for operation in wet gas mode. As these two classes of chemistries are both water soluble and contain surface active components, they have a tendency for interference reducing the efficacy of each inhibitor. Their pairing in a production scenario requires both comprehensive performance testing as well as extensive secondary properties evaluation. The KHI is to serve as a traditional KHI during steady-state operations while performing as a thermodynamic hydrate inhibitor (THI) during extended shut-ins and cold well restarts. This challenge required the development of a KHI which would retain performance upon significant dilution in a thermodynamic hydrate inhibitor solvent carrier (methanol, ethanol, monoethylene glycol, etc). Performance of this new KHI would be confirmed in blind rocking cell experiments, in the presence of the matched corrosion inhibitor, targeting a hold time of more than eight days at a subcooling of 8CÂ°. The CI is targeted to reduce the general corrosion rate to less than 0.1 mmpy and prevent localized attack. Due to the surfactancy of this class of chemistry, the tendency to induce and stabilize emulsions is of high concern. A robust formulation amenable to modification and potential dilution is required to address the application of chemical over a vast subsea network containing wells of varying age,existing infrastructure, production profiles, and operating conditions. This paper describes the development, qualification process, related lessons learned, and field applications of this new KHI/CI package.

As a result, they play a disproportionately important role in the microbially mediated cycling of marine nutrients. These systems are characterized by strong natural variations in carbon dioxide concentrations, pH, nutrient levels and sea surface temperatures on both seasonal and interannual timescales. Despite this natural variability, changes resulting from human activities are starting to emerge. Carbon dioxide derived from fossil fuel combustion is adding to the acidity of upwelled low-pH waters. Low-oxygen waters associated with coastal upwelling systems are growing in their extent and intensity as a result of a rise in upper ocean temperatures and productivity. And nutrient inputs to the coastal ocean continue to grow. Coastal upwelling systems may prove more resilient to changes resulting from human activities than other ocean ecosystems because of their ability to function under extremely variable conditions. Nevertheless, shifts in primary production, fish yields, nitrogen gain and loss, and the flux of climate-relevant gases could result from the perturbation of these highly productive and dynamic ecosystems.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1038/NGEO1916</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210467</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Coastal upwelling affects filter-feeder stable isotope composition across three continents</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Large-scale nutrient fertilisation by coastal upwelling promotes benthic productivity through energy subsidies from enhanced phytoplankton production, and predictions of alterations to upwelling under climate change have implications for benthic ecosystem functioning.

Due to climate warming, Antarctic marine ecosystems are being affected by glacier retreat opening new habitats, e.g., newly ice-free areas that can be colonized by macroalgae. As a consequence, primary production and fate of macroalgae are changing in these new polar environments. In these ecosystems, the carbon production, especially from large brown algae, is an important food source to the benthic invertebrate communities mainly when other resources are scarce. Thus, in new areas colonized by seaweeds, the trophic structure and biogeochemical fluxes can vary considerably. Moreover, when seaweeds die or are removed by water movement, ice scouring, or storms, they are detached, fragmented, and degraded, incorporating and releasing particulate and dissolved organic matter to the coastal food webs, i.e., they support a large fraction of the secondary production of the benthos. The present chapter is a review of the knowledge on seaweed biomass and production in the coastal Antarctic ecosystem opening a discussion on the role of these organisms as main energy sources in, e.g., small fjords and glacier-influenced sites, impacted by recent climatic change.

Greenhouse gas exchange rates in these terrestrial-aquatic ecosystems are highly variable worldwide with climate, soil type, plant community, and weather. Therefore, increasing data collection and availability should be a priority. Here, we demonstrate and validate physical and analytical modifications to automated soil-flux chamber measurement methods for unattended use in tidally driven wetlands, allowing the high-frequency capture of storm surge and day/night dynamics. Winter CO2 flux from Sarcocornia perennis marsh to the atmosphere was significantly greater during the day (2.8 mmol m(-2) hr(-1)) than the night (2.2 mmol m(-2) hr(-1); p &lt; 0.001), while CH4 was significantly greater during the night (0.16 mu mol m(-2) hr(-1)) than the day (-0.13 mu mol m(-2) hr(-1); p = 0.04). The magnitude of CO2 flux during the day and the frequency of CH4 flux were reduced during a surge (p &lt; 0.001). Surge did not significantly affect N2O flux, which without non-detects was normally distributed around -24.2 nmol m(-2) hr(-1). Analysis with sustained-flux global potentials and increased storm surge frequency scenarios, 2020 to 2100, suggested that the marsh in winter remains an atmospheric CO2 source. The modeled results showed an increased flux of CO2 to the atmosphere, while in soil, the uptake of CH4 increased and N2O uptake decreased. We present analytical routines to correctly capture gas flux curves in dynamic overland flooding conditions and to flag data that are below detection limits or from unobserved chamber-malfunction situations. Storm surge is an important phenomenon globally, but event-driven, episodic factors can be poorly estimated by infrequent sampling. Wider deployment of this system would permit inclusion of surge events in greenhouse gas estimates.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1111/gcb.14430</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210476</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Selective Conversion of CO2 by Single-Site Catalysts</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Industrial revolution has led to increased combustion of fossil fuels. Consequently, large amounts of CO2 are emitted to the atmosphere, throwing the carbon cycle out of balance. Currently, the most effective method to reduce the CO2 concentration is direct CO2 capture from the atmosphere and pumping of the captured CO2 deep underground or into the mid-ocean. The transformation of CO2 into high-value chemicals is an attractive yet challenging task. In recent years, there has been much interest in the development of CO2 utilization technologies based on electrochemical CO2 reduction, photochemical CO2 reduction, and thermal CO2 reduction, and CO2 valorization has emerged as a hot research topic. In electrochemical CO2 reduction, the cathodic reaction is the reduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals. The anodic reaction should be the oxygen evolution reaction, and water is the only renewable and scalable source of electrons and protons in this reaction. There is a plethora of research on the use of various metals to catalyze this reaction. Among these, Cu-based materials have been demonstrated to show unique catalytic activity and stability for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to valuable fuels and chemicals. Moreover, the solar-driven conversion of CO2 into value-added chemical fuels has attracted great attention, and much effort is being devoted to develop novel catalysts for the photoreduction of CO2, especially by mimicking the natural photosynthetic process. The key step in the photocatalytic process is the efficient generation of electron-hole pairs and separation of these charge carriers. The efficient separation of photoinduced charge carriers plays a crucial role in the final catalytic activity. Compared with CO2 reduction via electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, thermal reduction is more attractive because of its potential large-scale application in the industry. Heterogeneous nanomaterials show excellent activity in the electrocatalytic, photocatalytic, and thermal catalytic conversion of CO2. However, nanostructured materials have drawbacks on the investigation of the intrinsic activity of the active sites. In recent years, single-site catalysts have become popular because they allow for maximum utilization of the metal centers, show specific catalytic performance, and facilitate easy elucidation of the catalytic mechanism at the molecular level. Accordingly, numerous single-site catalysts were developed for CO2 reduction to produce value-added chemicals such as CO, CH4, CH3OH, formate, and C2+ products. Value-added chemicals have also been synthesized with the aid of amines and epoxides. This review summarizes recent state-of-the-art single-site catalysts and their application as heterogeneous catalysts for the electroreduction, photoreduction, and thermal reduction of CO2. In the discussion, we will highlight the structure-activity relationships for the catalytic conversion of CO2 with single-site catalysts.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3866/PKU.WHXB202006080</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210477</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Effect of common impurities on the phase behaviour of carbon dioxide rich systems: Minimizing the risk of hydrate formation and two-phase flow</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">CO2 produced by carbon capture processes is generally not pure and can contain impurities such as N2, H2, CO, H 2S and water. The presence of these impurities could lead to challenging flow assurance issues. The presence of water may result in ice and/or gas hydrate formation and cause blockage. Reducing the water content is commonly required to reduce the potential for corrosion but for an offshore pipeline system it is also used as a means of preventing gas hydrate problems; however, there is little information on the dehydration requirements. Furthermore, the gaseous CO2 rich stream is generally compressed to be transported as liquid or dense-phase in order to avoid two-phase flow and increase the density of the system. The presence of the above impurities will also change the system's bubble point pressure, hence affecting the compression requirement. The aim of this communication is to evaluate the risk of hydrate formation in a rich carbon dioxide stream and to study the phase behaviour of CO2 in the presence of common impurities. An experimental methodology was developed for measuring water content in CO2 rich phase in equilibrium with hydrates. The water content in equilibrium with hydrates at simulated pipeline conditions (e.g., 4 Â°C up to 190 bar) as well as after simulated choke conditions (e.g., at -2 Â°C and around 50 bar) were measured for pure CO2 and a mixture of 2 mole% H2 and 98 mole% CO2. Bubble point measurements were also carried out for this binary mixture for temperatures ranging from -20 Â°C to 25 Â°C. A thermodynamic approach was employed to model the phase equilibria. The experimental data available in the literature on gas solubility in water in binary systems were used in tuning the BIPs. The thermodynamic model was used to predict the phase behaviour and the hydrate dissociation conditions of various CO2 rich streams in the presence of free water and various levels of dehydration (250 ppm and 500 ppm). The results are in good agreement with the available experimental data. The developed experimental methodology and thermodynamic model could provide the necessary data in determining the required dehydration level for CO2 rich systems, as well as minimum pipeline pressure required to avoid two phase flow, hydrates, and water condensation.

There were over 800 presentations and over 250 exhibitors. The emphasis on carbon dioxide related to how it is to be stored in Norway, USA, Canada, Australia, and France. In Norway, the first industrial scale use of trapping carbon dioxide has been underway since 1996 in the Sleipner offshore field in the North Sea where 1 million ton of carbon dioxide are captured and injected into a saline aquifer (Utsira). About a dozen sequestration projects in the USA are discussed. In Texas, 274 power plants produce 200 million ton of carbon dioxide or 55% of the total emitted in the state. Three aquifer sites at depths of 4500 ft have been identified for the power plants of Gibbons Creek, Sam K. Seymour, and Martin Lake that emit 3.5, 12.2, and 18.4 million ton of carbon dioxide. Several states (Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, and Ohio) have created the MIDCARD (Midcontinent Interactive Digital Carbon Atlas and Regional Database) consortium that has built the Relation Database Management System and GIS to itemize the main sources of carbon dioxide and possibilities of geologic sequestration on their territory. In Kentucky, marls seem to offer an initial possibility for sequestration but they are not yet tested. In Kansas, a project brings together co-generation, ethanol production, and assisted oil recovery with carbon dioxide. In another project carbon dioxide is sent to coal layers where methane is freed and carbon dioxide accumulates. Another project involves capture of carbon dioxide by lime. The Teapot Dome in Wyoming has been chosen for a sequestration test. In Alabama, samples have been analyzed in the Black Warrior basin to determine absorption isotherms of carbon dioxide and methane. In tho state of Washington, the mineralization of carbon dioxide is obtained in basalt formations. A map of methane gas fields absorbed in coal has been drawn for the USA in active and abandoned mines. The physics of coal and interactions between carbon dioxide and methane are under study. In Nova Scotia the levels of coal indicate the possibility to sequester carbon dioxide with the extraction of methane. In Australia, site research is ongoing with the GEODISC program. In France, IFP studies the evolution of carbon dioxide injected into aquifers or fields depleted of hydrocarbons.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210485</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Development of a Low-Power Underwater NFC-Enabled Sensor Device for Seaweed Monitoring</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Aquaculture farming faces challenges to increase production while maintaining welfare of livestock, efficiently use of resources, and being environmentally sustainable. To help overcome these challenges, remote and real-time monitoring of the environmental and biological conditions of the aquaculture site is highly important. Multiple remote monitoring solutions for investigating the growth of seaweed are available, but no integrated solution that monitors different biotic and abiotic factors exists. A new integrated multi-sensing system would reduce the cost and time required to deploy the system and provide useful information on the dynamic forces affecting the plants and the associated biomass of the harvest. In this work, we present the development of a novel miniature low-power NFC-enabled data acquisition system to monitor seaweed growth parameters in an aquaculture context. It logs temperature, light intensity, depth, and motion, and these data can be transmitted or downloaded to enable informed decision making for the seaweed farmers. The device is fully customisable and designed to be attached to seaweed or associated mooring lines. The developed system was characterised in laboratory settings to validate and calibrate the embedded sensors. It performs comparably to commercial environmental sensors, enabling the use of the device to be deployed in commercial and research settings.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/s21144649</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210497</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Detection and tracking of aircraft over wind farms using SCANTER 4002 with embedded tracker 2</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Test results of aircraft detection and tracking over large offshore wind farms show that a track can be maintained on a light manoeuvring aircraft as well as general aviation aircraft using an off-the-shelf radar solution.

However, the carbon sequestration potential of Indian mangroves generally remained unexplored to date. In this study, multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and 2 data-derived variables were used to estimate the AGB of a tropical carbon-rich mangrove forest of India. Ensemble prediction of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosted Model (GBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were used for AGB prediction. The multi-temporal dataset was used in two different ways to find the most suitable method of using them. The results of the analysis showed that the modeling field measured AGB with individual date data values results in estimates with root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 149.242 t/ha for XGB to 151.149 t/ha for the RF. Modeling AGB with the average and percentile metrics of the multi-temporal image stack improves the prediction accuracy of AGB, with RMSE ranging from 81.882 t/ha for the XGB to 74.493 t/ha for the RF. The AGB modeling using ensemble prediction showed further improvement in accuracy with an RMSE of 72.864 t/ha and normalized RMSE of 11.38%. In this study, the intra-seasonal variation of Sentinel-1 and 2 data for mangrove ecosystems was explored for the first time. The variations in remotely sensed variables could be attributed mainly to soil moisture availability and rainfall in the mangrove ecosystem. The efficiency of Sentinel-1 and 2 data-derived variables and ensemble prediction of machine learning models for Indian mangroves were also explored for the first time. The methodologies established in this study can be used in the future for accurate prediction and repeated monitoring of AGB for mangrove ecosystems.

By using newly collected natural seawater, which is a chemically and biologically complex fluid, our experiments in pressurized, refrigerated vessels closely track the growth mechanisms of gas hydrate in oceanic seafloors. Nearly complete pore fill by hydrate can best be accomplished by nucleation of hydrate at point sources within the pore water or on sediment particulate, with growth outward into water space that is refreshed with circulating pore water having high concentrations of hydrate forming gas. Recovery of natural gas from hydrate deposits will depend on ensuring a large enough surface area of hydrate exposed to the circulating pore water. Fracking may be required.

Low abandonment pressure in the reservoir provides additional voidage-replacement potential for CO2 and allows for a low surface pump pressure during the early period of injection. However, the injection process poses several challenges. This work aims to raise awareness of key operational challenges related to CO2 injection in low-pressure reservoirs and to provide a new approach to assessing the phase behavior of CO2 within the wellbore. When the reservoir pressure is below the CO2 bubble-point pressure, and CO2 is injected in its liquid or supercritical state, CO2 will vaporize and expand within the well-tubing or in the near-wellbore region of the reservoir. This phenomenon is associated with several flow assurance problems. For instance, when CO2 transitions from the dense-state to the gas-state, CO2 density drops sharply, affecting the wellhead pressure control and the pressure response at the well bottom-hole. As CO2 expands with a lower phase viscosity, the flow velocity increases abruptly, possibly causing erosion and cavitation in the flowlines. Furthermore, CO2 expansion is associated with the Joule-Thomson (IJ) effect, which may result in dry ice or hydrate formation and therefore may reduce CO2 injectivity. Understanding the transient multiphase phase flow behavior of CO2 within the wellbore is crucial for appropriate well design and operational risk assessment. The commonly used approach analyzes the flow in the wellbore without taking into consideration the transient pressure response of the reservoir, which predicts an unrealistic pressure gap at the wellhead. This pressure gap is related to the phase transition of CO2 from its dense state to the gas state. In this work, a new coupled approach is introduced to address the phase behavior of CO2 within the wellbore under different operational conditions. The proposed approach integrates the flow within both the wellbore and the reservoir at the transient state and therefore resolves the pressure gap issue. Finally, the energy costs associated with a mitigation process that involves CO2 heating at the wellhead are assessed.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/geosciences9050199</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210513</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">What Feeds the Benthos in the Arctic Basins? Assembling a Carbon Budget for the Deep Arctic Ocean</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Half of the Arctic Ocean is deep sea (>1000 m), and this area is currently transitioning from being permanently ice-covered to being seasonally ice-free. Despite these drastic changes, it remains unclear how organisms are distributed in the deep Arctic basins, and particularly what feeds them. Here, we summarize data on auto- and heterotrophic organisms in the benthic, pelagic, and sympagic realm of the Arctic Ocean basins from the past three decades and put together an organic carbon budget for this region. Based on the budget, we investigate whether our current understanding of primary and secondary production and vertical carbon flux are balanced by the current estimates of the carbon demand by deep-sea benthos. At first glance, our budget identifies a mismatch between the carbon supply by primary production (3-46 g C m(-2) yr(-1)), the carbon demand of organisms living in the pelagic (7-17 g C m(-2)) and the benthic realm (&lt; 5 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) versus the low vertical carbon export (at 200 m: 0.1-1.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1), at 3000-4000 m: 0.01-0.73 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). To close the budget, we suggest that episodic events of large, fast sinking ice algae aggregates, export of dead zooplankton, as well as large food falls need to be quantified and included. This work emphasizes the clear need for a better understanding of the quantity, phenology, and the regionality of carbon supply and demand in the deep Arctic basins, which will allow us to evaluate how the ecosystem may change in the future.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3389/fmars.2020.00224</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210517</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">ELECTRIC FIELD ANALYSIS OF HIGH VOLTAGE SUBMARINE CABLES</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Electric power systems have been in use for more than a century.

In order to utilize properly the renewable energy potential, the sea platform will also include batteries and diesel generator, whereas the option of grid interconnection with Crete Island is also examined, in order to purchase and sell its electricity when needed. The alternative options that are examined include different battery autonomy, various funding options, and sensitivity analysis of the results regarding different lending parameters. The financial indices used in this analysis are: net present value, internal rate of return, discounted payback period, and weighted average cost of capital. The results show that the operation of the sea platform can be economically viable if annual incomes of a few hundred thousand euros exist, provided by platforms research activities.

In investigating the effect of sediment transport on turbine array performance, we consider two artificial scenarios of 16 turbines deployed in aligned and staggered layouts to explore the impact of morphodynamics on power conversion. An optimisation algorithm is then applied to improve the position of turbines to maximize power output. Comparing this optimisation for a case with and without sediment transport we study the effect of morphodynamics on optimal layouts. The results show that sediment transport can significantly influence the performance of the aligned layout turbine array. As for the layout optimisation process, the inclusion of sediment transport makes little difference to the final results, while the computational cost becomes substantial when including the sediment model within the optimisation, even for a steady state case.

In this scenario, the volumetric rates and cumulative volumes of CO2 injection would be comparable to or higher than those related to existing deep-subsurface injection and extraction activities, such as oil production. Large-scale pressure build-up in response to the injection may limit the dynamic storage capacity of suitable formations, because over-pressurization may fracture the caprock, may drive CO2/brine leakage through localized pathways, and may cause induced seismicity. On the other hand, laterally extensive sedimentary basins may be less affected by such limitations because (i) local pressure effects are moderated by pressure propagation and brine displacement into regions far away from the CO2 storage domain; and (ii) diffuse and/or localized brine migration into overlying and underlying formations allows for pressure bleed-off in the vertical direction. A quick analytical estimate of the extent of pressure build-up induced by industrial-scale CO2 storage projects is presented. Also discussed are pressure perturbation and attenuation effects simulated for two representative sedimentary basins in the USA: the laterally extensive Illinois Basin and the partially compartmentalized southern San Joaquin Basin in California. These studies show that the limiting effect of pressure build-up on dynamic storage capacity is not as significant as suggested by Ehlig-Economides and Economides, who considered closed systems without any attenuation effects.

The most critical scientific problem has been the selection of storage site for long-term safety, as well as reliable and reasonable estimation of CO2 storage capacity. This paper analyzed the stability effect factors in identifying the most suitable reservoir-seal assemblages in the Subei Basin in China. In this area, the Lower Yancheng Formation and the Upper Sanduo Formation were selected accurately based on analysis of their geomorphological and geological characteristics. Considering simultaneously the different tectonic units, cap-rock conditions, hydrodynamic conditions, and other factors, these formations could function as optimal reservoirs. The storage capacity in the aquifer layers hosted by these formations was estimated. The results showed that, on average, the storage capacity of the Lower Yancheng Formation is approximately 21.788 x 10(8) t, whereas that of the Upper Sanduo Formation is approximately 45.866 x 10(8) t. For the first-order tectonic units, the total storage capacity of the aforementioned two reservoir formations in the Yanfu Depression and the Dongtai Depression reaches 11.01 x 10(8) and 56.644 x 10(8) t, respectively, at the basin scale.

Slowing meridional overturning circulation (MOC) differentially impacts the ocean biological and solubility carbon pumps, leaving the net impact on ocean carbon uptake uncertain. Here using a suite of ESMs, we show that slowing MOC reduces anthropogenic carbon uptake by the solubility pump but increases deep-ocean storage of carbon and nutrients by the biological pump. The net effect reduces ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2. The deep-ocean nutrient sequestration will increasingly depress global-scale, marine net primary production over time. MOC slowdown represents a positive feedback that could extend or intensify peak-warmth climate conditions on multi-century timescales.

Here, we present first data on fatality rates, fatality factors and the likely origin of bats killed by WT in the Dobrogea region (Romania), located in a major migratory corridor for wildlife in Eastern Europe. Over a 4-year period, we found a total of 166 bat carcasses from 10 species, mostly representing migratory species such as Pipistrellus nathusii and Nyctalus noctula. Most fatalities at WT occurred in July and August. We documented 15 cases of barotrauma and 34 cases of blunt-force trauma in carcasses found below WT. After adjusting for carcass removals and variations in searcher efficiency, we estimated for the 4-year study period a total of 2394 bat casualties at the studied WT facility consisting of 20 units, resulting in a mean fatality rate of 30 bats/WT/year, or 14.2 bats/MW/year. By implementing a curtailment measure at wind speeds below 6.5 m/s, we reduced fatality rates by 78\%. Isoscape origin models based on hydrogen stable isotope ratios in fur keratin revealed that the majority of N. noctula that were killed by WT or captured nearby in mist nets originated from distant areas in the North (Ukraine, Belarus, Russia). The estimated high fatalitjegangy rates of bats at WT in this area have far-reaching consequences, particularly for populations of migratory bats, if no appropriate mitigation schemes are practised.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s10344-020-01378-x</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210540</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Potential fate of wetland soil carbon in a deltaic coastal wetland subjected to high relative sea level rise</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The fate of soil carbon in eroding coastal wetlands is of great concern, given the potential for a feedback loop from coastal wetland soil that would dramatically increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The biogeochemical transformations and overall fate of this soil carbon upon coastal erosion were investigated through geophysical and spectroscopic analysis of soil and associated dissolved organic matter. Bay water and core sections were collected across transects encompassing both intact and eroded, submerged, sections of a coastal marsh in Barataria Bay, Louisiana. We noted: i) a vertical increase in carbon content, humification of organic matter, and decrease in biotic degradation with depth at all sites; ii) an erosion and ultimate collapse of the top ~ 0â€“20 cm of the intact marsh's edge into the bay water due to the undercutting caused by tidal/wave forces; iii) the loss of the stored carbon from the submerged site's top 10 cm layer; and iv) leaching, dilution, abiotic, and biotic degradation of the marsh carbon due to the exposure to the bay water. This erosion and degradation of wetland soil carbon stores demonstrates the potential impact of rising sea levels on the future fate of coastal wetland carbon and atmospheric CO2 levels.

These environments are zones of high energy and changes that impact the long-term viability of subsurface intake systems. A key aspect for evaluation is a detailed analysis of the sediment budget and transport system along the beach and nearshore environments. Erosion of the shoreline or rapid deposition could cause the failure of many subsurface intake systems, especially beach and offshore gallery intakes. Both the seasonal fluctuations in shoreline profiles and the long-term trends in sedimentation must be evaluated. Large capacity subsurface SWRO intake systems, such as that proposed at Huntington Beach, California, require an optimal siting and evaluation analysis to be conducted using modern modeling and analytical methods. A detailed summary of global littoral and nearshore processes as related to the design and construction of subsurface intake systems is presented with a detailed analysis showing how the natural system was evaluated to select a stable site for a seabed gallery (infiltration) system at Huntington Beach, California, which is a high energy shoreline that creates considerable challenges in siting and construction.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/978-3-319-13203-7</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210545</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">SOLAR ENERGY RESEARCH, SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATIONS</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">People relay upon oil for primary energy and this for a few more decades. Other orthodox sources may be more enduring, but are not without serious disadvantages. Power from natural resources has always had great appeal. Coal is plentiful, though there is concern about despoliation in winning it and pollution in burning it. Nuclear power has been developed with remarkable timeliness, but is not universally welcomed, construction of the plant is energy-intensive and there is concern about the disposal of its long-lived active wastes. Barrels of oil, lumps of coal, even uranium come from nature but the possibilities of almost limitless power from the atmosphere and the oceans seem to have special attraction. The wind machine provided an early way of developing motive power. The massive increases in fuel prices over the last years have however, made any scheme not requiring fuel appear to be more attractive and to be worth reinvestigation. In considering the atmosphere and the oceans as energy sources the four main contenders are wind power, wave power, tidal and power from ocean thermal gradients. The renewable energy resources are particularly suited for the provision of rural power supplies and a major advantage is that equipment such as flat plate solar driers, wind machines, etc., can be constructed using local resources and without the advantage results from the feasibility of local maintenance and the general encouragement such local manufacture gives to the build up of small-scale rural based industry. This chapter gives some examples of small-scale energy converters, nevertheless it should be noted that small conventional i.e., engines are currently the major source of power in rural areas and will continue to be so for a long time to come. There is a need for some further development to suit local conditions, to minimise spares holdings, to maximise interchangeability both of engine parts and of the engine application. Emphasis should be placed on full local manufacture.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210548</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Effect of mangrove species on removal of tetrabromobisphenol A from contaminated sediments</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The increase levels of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in mangrove wetlands is of concern due to its potential toxic impacts on ecosystem. A 93-day greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of mangrove plants, A. marina and K. obovata, on TBBPA degradation in sediment and to reveal the associated contributing factor(s) for its degradation. Results show that both mangrove species could uptake, translocate, and accumulate TBBPA from mangrove sediments. Compared to the unplanted sediment, urease and dehydrogenase activity as well as total bacterial abundance increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) in the sediment planted with mangrove plants, especially for K. obovata. In the mangrove-planted sediment, the Anaerolineae genus was the dominant bacteria, which has been reported to enhance TBBPA dissipation, and its abundance increased significantly in the sediment at early stage (0 35 day) of the greenhouse experiment. Compared to A. marina-planted sediment, higher enrichment of Geobater, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, Azoarcus, all of which could stimulate TBBPA degradation, was observed for the K. obovata-planted sediment during the 93-day growth period. Our mass balance result has suggested that plant-induced TBBPA degradation in the mangrove sediment is largely due to elevated microbial activities and total bacterial abundance in the rhizosphere, rather than plant uptake. In addition, different TBBPA removal efficiencies were observed in the sediments planted with different mangrove species. This study has demonstrated that K. obovata is a more suitable mangrove species than A. marina when used for remediation of TBBPA-contaminated sediment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This provided a professional basis for the introduction of wind power in Denmark during the first two decades of this century and later during the Second World War. That phase of Danish wind power development culminated with the 200 kW Gedser mill operating from 1959 to 1967 with great reliability. After the oil crisis in 1973, a new phase of Danish wind power development was initiated. Using the basic concept from the Gedser mill, a government-sponsored programme has led to a strong commercial development of Danish wind turbines. In the late seventies, typical Danish turbines had power ratings around 20 kW. Today, 500 to 600 kW turbines are commercially available. As of early 1995 more than 500 MW of wind electric capacity is installed in Denmark, covering about 3.5% of Danish electricity demand. The official target is to cover 10% of electricity demand by the year 2005. The corresponding installed capacity would amount to 1300 to 1500 MW. Recently, growing local opposition to the Danish wind programme has delayed the development toward the official target for 2005. The Danish government is now taking new initiatives in order to overcome this barrier, including increased pressure on municipalities and development of new offshore sites for wind farms. Another barrier may be introduced by a single energy market in the EU which does not fully incorporate externalities in the market price. Long-range coverage of more than 25% of Danish electricity demand by wind is a realistic goal, especially if a close coupling with Norwegian hydropower can be established.

Modeling is probably the only practical way to know how much good sequestration is doing, or would do if implemented, since even with sequestration, atmospheric CO2 would be expected to continue to increase because of the release of non-sequestered CO2 and the return to the atmosphere of sequestered CO2, We have employed a carbon cycle model based on an ocean general circulation model to estimate the return of sequestered CO2 to the atmosphere for sequestration in the pre-industrial ocean at sites near Tokyo, San Francisco, New York and Miami. Significant differences in the effectiveness of sequestration are found. Off the East Coast of the USA, the atmospheric concentration due to the return of sequestered CO2 quickly rises to near the final equilibrium value, for all depths below about 800 m. Off the West Coast of the USA, the CO2 is effectively hidden from the atmosphere for several hundred years, for depths below 800 m. Then the atmospheric concentration rises to larger values than for sequestration off the East Coast. Sequestration off the coast of Japan at 800 m is similar to sequestration off the West Coast of the USA, but without the time delay. These predicted differences are understandable in terms of ocean circulation. Sequestration in the post-industrial ocean beginning in the year 2000 has been modeled also and sites near Tokyo acid New York. This calculation includes additional CO2 from a representation of anthropogenic CO2 for the entire fossil fuel era. No-sequestered CO2 tends to flush the sequestered CO2 out of the ocean by reducing the concentration of the carbonate ion, with which CO2 reacts. Results are less favorable in the post-industrial ocean. The pre-industrial ocean model can help in the selection of location and depth, but the post-industrial ocean model is more realistic. ``Thus human beings are now carrying out a large scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future. Within a few centuries we are returning to the atmosphere and oceans the concentrated organic carbon stored in sedimentary rocks over hundreds of millions of years{''} Roger Revelle and Hans Suess.(1) (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is mainly evaluated by the mean Global Warming impact indicator, expressed in grams of CO2 equivalent per MJ of energy (gCO2eqÂ·MJ-1). Biofuels are highly relevant renewable energy options on a global scale. Comparing with fossil fuels, biofuels in some cases can be carbon neutral or even carbon negative and play an important role in the reduction of GHG emissions. A number of LCA have shown that first generation biofuels provide a little to no benefit for GHG reductions compared to fossil fuels, particularly when indirect effects are considered. LCAs of second and third generation biofuels exhibit great variability and uncertainty but are intended to achieve greater GHG reductions. Highly possible Arctic Ocean ice meltdown in the late summer as soon as in September 2015 and accelerated methane hydrate destabilization in the Arctic Ocean seabed via ocean warming could cause abrupt climate change in the following decade. Mitigation of climate change requires to use only biofuels with the global warming impact indicator close to 0 gCO2eqÂ·MJ-1 (Carbon Neutral) or - gCO2eqÂ·MJ-1 (Carbon Negative).</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210560</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Coastal reclamation alters soil microbial communities following different land use patterns in the Eastern coastal zone of China</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Coastal reclamation seriously disturbs coastal wetland ecosystems, while its influences on soil microbial communities remain unclear. In this study, we examined the impacts of coastal reclamation on soil microbial communities based on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis following the conversion of Phragmites australis wetlands to different land use types. Coastal reclamation enhanced total soil microbial biomass and various species (i.e., gram-positive bacterial, actinomycete, saturated straight-chain, and branched PLFA) following the conversion of P. australis wetland to aquaculture pond, wheat, and oilseed rape fields. In contrast, it greatly decreased total soil microbial biomass and various species following the conversion of P. australis wetland to town construction land. Coastal reclamation reduced fungal:bacterial PLFA, monounsaturated:branched PLFA ratios, whereas increasing gram-positive:gram-negative PLFA ratio following the conversion of P. australis wetland to other land use types. Our study suggested that coastal reclamation shifted soil microbial communities by altering microbial biomass and community composition. These changes were driven primarily by variations in soil nutrient substrates and physiochemical properties. Changes in soil microbial communities following coastal reclamation impacted the decomposition and accumulation of soil carbon and nitrogen, with potential modification of carbon and nitrogen sinks in the ecosystems, with potential feedbacks in response to climate change.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1038/s41598-021-86758-2</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210562</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Variability of soil organic carbon reservation capability between coastal salt marsh and riverside freshwater wetland in Chongming Dongtan and its microbial mechanism</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Two representative zones in Chongming Dongtan which faced the Yangtze River and East China Sea respectively were selected to study the variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) reservation capability between coastal wetland and riverside wetland in the Chongming Dongtan wetland as well as its mechanism by analyzing soil characteristics and plant biomass. The results showed the SOC content of riverside wetland was only 48.61\% (P = 0.000 &lt; 0.05) that of coastal wetland. As the organic matter inputs from plant litter of the coastal wetland and riverside wetland were approximately the same, the higher soil microbial respiration (SMR) of riverside wetland led to its lower SOC reservation capability. In the riverside wetland, the high soil microbial biomass, higher proportion of beta-Proteobacteria, which have strong carbon metabolism activity and the existence of some specific aerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as Bacilli and uncultured Lactococcus, were the important reasons for the higher SMR compared to the coastal wetland. There were additional differences in soil physical and chemical characteristics between the coastal wetland and riverside wetlands. Path analysis of predominant bacteria and microbial biomass showed that soil salinity influenced beta-Proteobacteria and microbial biomass most negatively among these physical and chemical factors. Therefore the low salinity of the riverside area was suitable for the growth of microorganisms, especially beta-Proteobacteria and some specific bacteria, which led to the high SMR and low SOC reservation capability when compared to the coastal area.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/S1001-0742(11)60877-2</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210564</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Getting the story across</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Ten years of experience with carbon capture and storage on Sleipner East in the North Sea is worth having when studying value chains for this greenhouse gas.

Design and methods Forty-four Caucasian men and women, aged 41-79 years (mean +/- SEM 55.5 +/- 1.4), restricted their dietary intake of sodium chloride for 11 days and ingested sodium chloride capsules (an additional 190 mmol sodium/day) during the last seven of those days, On days 1, 4 and 11, resting PETCO(2) and blood pressure were monitored for 25 min in the laboratory, followed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in the natural environment for 24 h, Overnight urine samples were obtained at days 4 and 11 to estimate excretion of sodium and of an endogenous digitalis-like factor (EDLF) that is sensitive to changes in plasma volume, Results Individual resting PETCO, remained stable within and between laboratory monitoring sessions and was correlated with urinary excretion of the endogenous digitalislike factor, both before and after the period of high sodium intake, The high-sodium diet was associated with increased urinary sodium excretion and body weight in all quartiles of PETCO(2). The high-sodium diet produced significant increases in resting and in 24 h systolic blood pressures in the upper two quartiles of the PETCO(2) distribution, and significant increases in resting and in 24 h diastolic blood pressures in the highest PETCO(2) quartile only, Conclusion These findings indicate that blood pressure sensitivity to sodium loading is differentially associated with high resting PETCO(2) in older adults, A high PETCO(2) may be an index of a dynamic steady state that influences sodium transport mechanisms.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1097/00004872-199609000-00005</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210576</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Effects of Consolidation under a Penetrating Footing in Carbonate Silty Clay</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The effects of consolidation under a footing are generally viewed as beneficial due to the resulting increased capacity. Consolidation may also be actively sought because it minimizes footing embedment, which can be critical for the installation of mobile offshore jack-ups because available leg length is limited. However, it can also set the platform footing up to subsequently punch through the strengthened zone, with potentially serious consequences. The problem is complex due to the three-dimensional nature of consolidation. Further, footing penetration leaves the soil above heavily remolded and generates large excess pore pressures below, such that the soil state even prior to consolidation is significantly altered from its in situ conditions. This study has taken an experimental approach to investigate the effects of consolidation around a footing penetrating into carbonate silty clay and, following detailed discussion of the response, offers a framework to predict the changes to the load-penetration curve.

Input data are: grass primary production (P-g), respiration (R), net calcification (G) and the ratio of CO2 released to CaCO3 precipitated (psi); the output is the amount of dissolved inorganic carbon (F-CO2) which needs to be exchanged with the atmosphere to balance biologically mediated changes in the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon in an open sea water system: F-CO2 = -P-g + R + psi G. Coral reef data were used in the model to illustrate the relative influence of organic and inorganic carbon metabolism on ocean-atmosphere CO2 cycling. A coral reef comprised of calcareous and non-calcareous organisms can be shown to act as a sink for atmospheric CO2 when excess (= net) production is high and CaCO3 precipitation is low. These characteristics are not typical of actively developing reef systems which typically exhibit a nearly balanced organic carbon metabolism (P-g/R approximate to 1) and relatively high rates of calcification. In these circumstances, reef communities can be expected to cause CO2 evasion to the atmosphere. This prediction is confirmed by the only existing measurement of air-sea CO2 flux in a coral reef system.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3354/meps129307</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210580</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Composting as Sustainable Managing Option for Seaweed Blooms on Recreational Beaches</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Purpose Seaweed blooms are an irregular but frequent phenomenon in many coastal areas and during the touristic season, can cause limitations for recreational use of beaches. Here, we propose composting of seaweed removed from the shoreline as alternative to current management practices (e.g. disposal in landfills or incineration). Methods A co-composting strategy with garden prune waste was chosen for the treatment of seaweed blooms removed from the beaches. Composting was performed in windrows of 10 m long, 1.5 m wide and 1 m high using different ratios of algae and garden prune residues (1:2; 1:1 and 2:1) at a composting facility in Rota (Cadiz, Spain). Results Characteristic temperature profiles consisting of a very brief mesophilic phase, a 15-20-day thermophilic phase (maximum of 50-70 degrees C) and a second mesophilic phase (40-35oC) after 30-50 days were observed. After curing for more than 160 days, a stabilized non-phytotoxic composted material (50-70 g kg(-1) C; 2-3 g kg(-1) N; C/N ratio of 21-27 and electrical conductivity between 1.8-2.4 mS cm(-1)) was obtained. Composting worked best using a 2:1 ratio (prune waste:algae). The composted organic material showed larger presence of stabilized lignin-derived compounds as assessed via nuclear magnetic resonance. No odors were detected during the composting process suggesting that open-air treatment is feasible. Conclusion The co-composting strategy provides a safe, local and sustainable approach to deal with seaweed blooms during peaks of recreational use and in situations where algae have to be removed.

We measured the daily ingestion rates of Prorocentrum minimum by Prorocentrum micans over 5 days in 10 L experimental bottles, and the uptake rates of total dissolved inorganic carbon (C-T) by a mixture of B micans and B minimum (mixotrophic growth), and for the predator B micans (phototrophic growth; control) and prey B minimum (phototrophic growth; control) alone. To account for the effect of pH on the phototrophic growth rates of B micans and P minimum, measurements of C-T and pH in the predator and prey control bottles were continued until the pH reached the same level (pH 9.5) as that in the experimental bottles on the final day of incubation. The measured total C-T uptake rate by the mixture of B micans and B minimum changed from 123 to 161 mu mol C-T kg(-1) d(-1) over the course of the experiment, and was lower than the C-T uptake rates shown by P. micans and B minimum in the predator and prey control bottles, respectively, which changed from 132 to 176 mol C-T kg(-1) d(-1) over the course of the experiment. The reduction in total C-T uptake rate arising from the mixotrophy of B micans was 7-31\% of the daily C-T uptake rate seen during photosynthesis. The results suggest that red tide dinoflagellates take up less C-T during mixotrophy.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.4490/algae.2016.31.11.17</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210589</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Water-air carbon fluxes in the coastal upwelling zone off northern Baja California</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">An important challenge in marine science is to quantify the air sea flux of carbon because of its possible relation to climate change and the decreasing pH in seawater. In coastal areas of Mexico, the magnitude and variability of carbon fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere is almost completely unknown. Therefore, the objective of this research was to determine the variability of air-sea carbon fluxes in the upwelling system off northern Baja California. A one-year time series of carbon fluxes was generated from data on partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) from an oceanographic buoy installed immediately south of Punta Banda (Ensenada, Baja California), which measured salinity, temperature, and pCO(2) in the water (pCO(2water)) and air (pCO(2air)) every 3 h during 2009. The study area presented several upwelling events with low sea surface temperatures (&lt;= 14 degrees C), salinity &lt;34.0, and high values of pCO(2),a, which resulted in an export of excess CO2 in the water to the atmosphere, identifying the area as a temporary source of CO2. In contrast, during the relaxation of upwelling, low values of PCO2water and intermediate surface temperatures resulted in the sea acting as a sink for CO2. The average daily flux was 0.6 0.11 mmol C m(-2) in winter, 2.8 +/- 0.27 mmol C m(-2) in spring, 0.3 +/- 0.11 mmol C m(-2) in summer, and -0.3 +/- 0.03 mmol C. m(-2) in autumn, the positive sign indicating fluxes from the water to the air and vice versa. The annual balance of CO2 fluxes was 0.3 +/- 0.06 mol C m(-2) yr(-1); thus, the system turned out to be a net source of CO2 from the ocean to the atmosphere.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.7773/cm.v41i2.2484</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210601</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Ultrasonic testing of laboratory samples representing monopile wind turbine foundations</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Wind energy turbines and offshore hydrocarbon platforms rely on injected concrete grout to support and transfer loads between steel substructures. Deterioration of this grout under large operational stresses can lead to a loss of bonding, the formation of gaps, crushing and the loss of grout from the annulus between the steel substructures. In this paper, the integrity of the grout between two steel panels is experimentally tested using a low-frequency ultrasound backscatter method[1]. The experimental results and modelled outcomes[1] are compared for grout condition classes, including: good condition, gaps between the grout and either steel panel and the complete absence of grout. Pearson correlation coefficients of over 83% are observed when comparing the notch magnitudes and the frequencies on the modelled and experimental reflectance spectra of the front and rear gap, as well as missing grout conditions. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) similarity tests on the modelled and experimental notch magnitudes indicate a 20% significance on the rear gap and front gap spectra and a 10% significance on the missing grout spectra. The significance of these tests supports the potential application of backscattered low-frequency ultrasound for grout condition inspection. However, development of automated condition recognition algorithms, based on either spectral characteristics or time-localised spectral features of the backscatter, is required to make routine inspection commercially viable.

To this end, EOR (enhanced oil recovery) and EGR (enhanced gas recovery) are regarded as being viable options for economically sequestrating large amounts of CO2. A feasible approach would involve capturing CO2 from large-scale CO2 emission sources such as power plants, and then transporting that captured gas to near-depleted oil and gas wells to maintain the reservoir pressure and enhance the oil/gas recovery rate. In the future, CO2 will be transported large distances from emission sources in developed countries to oil/gas producing regions by pipelines or ships. The long-distance ship-based transport of CO2 would require that the gas be compressed or liquefied (LCO2). Furthermore, an LCO2 transport ship would have to be capable of processing boil-off gas while at sea. In this study, the selection method of compressors for re-liquefaction system of dedicated LCO2 transport ship was investigated by computational method. The performance of same compression ratio (SCR) method exhibited low levels of efficiency and reliability as for coefficient of performance (COP) and compressor discharge temperature in terms of oil degradation compared to that of intermediate pressure optimization (IPO). Of these three methods, IPO produced the highest level of performance of all, but could not guarantee compressor reliability as like SCR, too. Intermediate pressure optimization with same discharge temperature (IPODT) method was found to be better in terms of reliability, with a decrease in performance of only 5\% relative to that obtained by IPO. Consequently, we recommend the use of the IPODT method for the design of a multi-stage compression system for the re-liquefaction cycle of an LCO2 transport ship. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Wetland microtopography (hummock-hollow) also plays a critical role in mediating plant growth, microbial activity, and thus cycling of C and nutrients and may interact with rising seas to influence coastal wetland C dynamics. Recent evidence suggests that CH4 production in oxygenated surface soils of freshwater wetlands may contribute substantially to global CH4 production, but comprehensive studies linking potential CH4 production to environmental and microbial variables in temperate freshwater forested wetlands are lacking. This study investigated effects of temperature, moisture, and microtopography on potential net CO2 and CH4 production and extracellular enzyme activity (beta-glucosidase, xylosidase, phenol oxidase, and peroxidase) in peat soils collected from a freshwater forested wetland in coastal North Carolina, USA. Soils were retrieved from three microsites (hummock, hollow, and subsurface peat soils (approximately 20-40 cm below surface)) and incubated at two temperatures (27 degrees C and 32 degrees C) and soil water contents (65\% and 100\% water holding capacity (WHC)). Hummocks had the highest cumulative potential net CO2 (13.7 +/- 0.90 mg CO2-C g soil(-1)) and CH4 (1.8 +/- 0.42 mg CH4-C g soil(-1)) production and enzyme activity, followed by hollows (8.7 +/- 0.91 mg CO2-C g soil(-1) and 0.5 +/- 0.12 mg CH4-C g soil(-1)) and then subsurface soils (5.7 +/- 0.70 mg CO2-C g soil(-1) and 0.04 +/- 0.019 mg CH4-C g soil(-1)). Fully saturated soils had lower potential net CO2 production (50-80\%) and substantially higher potential net CH4 production compared to non-saturated soils (those incubated at 65\% WHC). Soils incubated at 32 degrees C increased potential net CO2 (24-34\%) and CH4 (56-404\%) production under both soil moisture levels compared to those incubated at 27 degrees C. The Q(10) values for potential net CO2 and CH4 production ranged from 1.5 to 2.3 and 3.3-8.8, respectively, and did not differ between any microsites or soil water content. Enrichment of delta(CO2)-C-13-C was found in saturated soils from all microsites (-24.4 to - 29.7 parts per thousand) compared to non-saturated soils (-31.1 to - 32.4 parts per thousand), while delta(CH4)-C-13-C ranged from -62 to -55 parts per thousand in saturated soils. Together, the CO2 and CH4 delta C-13 data suggest that acetoclastic methanogenesis is an important pathway for CH4 production in these wetlands. A positive relationship (Adj. R-2 = 0.40) between peroxidase activity and CH(4 )production was also found, indicating that peroxidase activity may be important in providing fermented C substrates to acetoclastic methanogenic communities and contribute to anaerobic C mineralization. These results suggest that changes in temperature and hydrology could stimulate CO2 and CH4 emissions from surface hummock soils, and to a lesser extent from hollow soils, and provide preliminary evidence that hummocks may be a spatially important and unrecognized hotspot for CH4 production.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115367</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210622</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Membrane biological reactor treatment of a saline backwash flow from a recirculating aquaculture system</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">A recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) can minimize water use, allowing fish production in regions where water is scarce and also placing the waterborne wastes into a concentrated and relatively small volume of effluent. The RAS effluent generated during clarifier backwash is usually small in volume (possibly 0.2-0.5\% of the total recirculating flow when microscreen filters are used) but contains high levels of concentrated organic solids and nutrients. When a RAS is operated at high salinities for culture of marine species, recovering the saltwater contained in the backwash effluent could allow for its reuse within the RAS and also reduce salt discharge to the environment. Membrane biological reactors (MBRs) combine activated sludge type treatment with membrane filtration. Therefore, in addition to removing biodegradable organics, suspended solids, and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, MBRs retain high concentrations of microorganisms and, when operated with membrane pore sizes &lt; 1 mu m, exclude microorganisms from their discharge. In this research, an Enviroquip (Austin, TX) MBR pilot-plant was installed and evaluated over a range of salinities to determine its effectiveness at removing bacteria, turbidity, suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus and cBOD(5) content from the approximately 22 m(3)/day concentrated biosolids backwash flow discharged from the RASs at The Conservation Fund Freshwater Institute. The MBR system was managed at a hydraulic retention time of 40.8 h, a solids retention time of 64 +/- 8 days, resulting in a Food: Microorganism ratio of 0.029 day(-1). Results indicated excellent removal efficiency (\%) of TSS (99.65 +/- 0.1 to 99.98 +/- 0.01) and TVs (99.96 +/- 0.01 to 99.99 +/- 0.0) at all salinity levels. Similarly, a 3-4 log(10) removal of total heterotrophic microbes and total coliform was seen at all treatment conditions. Total nitrogen removal efficiency (\%) ranged from 91.8 +/- 2.9 to 95.5 +/- 0.6 at the treatment levels and was consistent, provided a sufficient acclimation period to each new condition was given. Conversely, total phosphorus removal efficiencies (\%) at 0 ppt, 8 ppt, 16 ppt and 32 ppt salinity were 96.1 +/- 1.0, 72.7 +/- 3.5, 70.4 +/- 2.3, and 65.2 +/- 5.4, respectively, indicating reduced phosphorus removal at higher salinities.

We investigate the potential impact(s) of the diversion on marsh porewater through analysis of modern riverbank and suspended sediments, compared to sediments from pre-industrial deltaic deposits of LMR. Sequential extraction methods were used to evaluate Pb, cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) in the sediments. Our results show that metal contents are higher (e.g., 8- to 10-fold for Pb) in the modern sediments relative to pre-industrial deposits. Also, the reducible fraction, presumably iron/manganese (Fe/Mn) oxides/oxyhydroxides, is the chief reservoir of environmentally available metals. The substantially higher trace metal contents of the modern relative to pre-industrial sediments suggest that the modern sediments contain a sizeable amount of anthropogenic contributions. Furthermore, the concentration of the trace metals in the reducible fraction suggests bioavailability to marsh organisms upon reductive dissolution within the planned, constructed coastal marshes. Still, additional sediment samples from the marshlands during the diversion implementation phase will be necessary to support the preliminary findings in this contribution as it affects coastal marshes and vital local fisheries.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/soilsystems4030055</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210639</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Climate-induced decrease in biomass flow in marine food webs may severely affect predators and ecosystem production</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Climate change impacts on marine life in the world ocean are expected to accelerate over the 21st century, affecting the structure and functioning of food webs. We analyzed a key aspect of this issue, focusing on the impact of changes in biomass flow within marine food webs and the resulting effects on ecosystem biomass and production. We used a modeling framework based on a parsimonious quasi-physical representation of biomass flow through the food web, to explore the future of marine consumer biomass and production at the global scale over the 21st century. Biomass flow is determined by three climate-related factors: primary production entering the food web, trophic transfer efficiency describing losses in biomass transfers from one trophic level (TL) to the next, and flow kinetic measuring the speed of biomass transfers within the food web. Using climate projections of three earth system models, we calculated biomass and production at each TL on a 1Â° latitudeÂ Ã—1Â° longitude grid of the global ocean under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios. We show that the alterations of the trophic functioning of marine ecosystems, mainly driven by faster and less efficient biomass transfers and decreasing primary production, would lead to a projected decline in total consumer biomass by 18.5% by 2090â€“2099 relative to 1986â€“2005 under the â€œno mitigation policyâ€&#x9d; scenario. The projected decrease in transfer efficiency is expected to amplify impacts at higher TLs, leading to a 21.3% decrease in abundance of predators and thus to a change in the overall trophic structure of marine ecosystems. Marine animal production is also projected to decline but to a lesser extent than biomass. Our study highlights that the temporal and spatial projected changes in biomass and production would imply direct repercussions on the future of world fisheries and beyond all services provided by Ocean.

Understanding variability in flux and the key factors controlling emissions in these ecosystems are therefore important in the context of accounting for GHG emissions. The current study is the first to quantify GHG emissions using static chamber measurements from soils in disused aquaculture ponds, planted mangroves, and mature mangroves from the Ayeyarwady Delta, Myanmar. Soil properties, biomass and estimated net primary productivity were also assessed. Field assessments were conducted at the same sites during the middle of the dry season in February and end of the wet season in October 2019. Rates of soil CO2 efflux were among the highest yet recorded from mangrove ecosystems, with CO2 efflux from the 8 year old site reaching 86.8 Â± 17 Mg CO2 haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 during February, an average of 862% more than all other sites assessed during this period. In October, all sites had significant rates of soil CO2 efflux, with rates ranging from 31.9 Â± 4.4 Mg CO2 haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 in a disused pond to 118.9 Â± 24.3 Mg CO2 haâˆ’1 yrâˆ’1 in the 8 year old site. High soil CO2 efflux from the 8 year old site in February is most likely attributable to high rates of primary production and belowground carbon allocation. Elevated CO2 efflux from all sites during October was likely associated with the extreme 2019 South Asian monsoon season which lowered soil pore salinity and deposited new alluvium, stimulating both autotrophic and heterotrophic activity. Methane efflux increased significantly (50â€“400%) during the wet season from all sites with mangrove cover, although was a small overall component of soil GHG effluxes during both measurement periods. Our results highlight the critical importance of assessing GHG flux in-situ in order to quantify variability in carbon dynamics over time.

The magnitude of these processes is poorly constrained, because observations are typically interpolated over multiple years. Here, we used 298500 observations of CO2 fugacity (fCO(2)) from a single year (2015), to estimate the net influx of atmospheric CO2 as 26.2 +/- 4.7 Tg C yr(-1) over the open NW European shelf. CO2 influx from the atmosphere was dominated by influx during winter as a consequence of high winds, despite a smaller, thermally-driven, air-sea fCO(2) gradient compared to the larger, biologically-driven summer gradient. In order to understand this climate regulation service, we constructed a carbon-budget supplemented by data from the literature, where the NW European shelf is treated as a box with carbon entering and leaving the box. This budget showed that net C-burial was a small sink of 1.3 +/- 3.1 Tg C yr(-1), while CO2 efflux from estuaries to the atmosphere, removed the majority of river C-inputs. In contrast, the input from the Baltic Sea likely contributes to net export via the continental shelf pump and advection (34.4 +/- 6.0 Tg C yr(-1)).</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1038/s41598-019-56363-5</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210647</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">EMC problems caused by combinations of EHV transmission lines and electrified railway lines</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The percentage of electricity produced by renewable energy sources grows rapidly during last years. But high-power renewable energy sources like offshore or onshore wind farms in coastal regions are located very often far from consumers. The task of the energy transport over long distances becomes more and more important. Due to the difficulties finding new corridors for the extra high voltage (EHV) transmission lines in densely populated countries with developed infrastructure is often recommended to combine the new transmission line with other infrastructure objects like railways, highways and other transmission lines. One of theoretical possibilities is the use of common pylons for the installation of a new EHV transmission line together with catenary of electrified railway lines. Another one is the laying of HVDC cable parallel to the rail line. The proximity of different current feeding systems causes the electromagnetic interaction between transmission line and catenary. These interferences can disturb the operation of both systems. On the base of mathematical modelling of electromagnetic interferences between transmission lines and catenary the interaction between both systems is considered in the offered paper.

On the decadal to millennial timescales over which hydrate-sourced methane release is hypothesized to occur, several processes consuming methane below and above the seafloor have the potential to slow, reduce or even prevent such release. Yet, the modulating effect of these processes on seafloor methane emissions remains poorly quantified, and the full impact of benthic methane consumption on ocean carbon chemistry is still to be explored. In this review, we document the dynamic interplay between hydrate thermodynamics, benthic transport and biogeochemical reaction processes, that ultimately determines the impact of hydrate destabilisation on seafloor methane emissions and the ocean carbon cycle. Then, we provide an overview of how state-of-the-art numerical models treat such processes and examine their ability to quantify hydrate-sourced methane emissions from the seafloor, as well as their impact on benthic biogeochemical cycling. We discuss the limitations of current models in coupling the dynamic interplay between hydrate thermodynamics and the different reaction and transport processes that control the efficiency of the benthic sink, and highlight their shortcoming in assessing the full implication of methane release on ocean carbon cycling. Finally, we recommend that current Earth system models explicitly account for hydrate driven benthic-pelagic exchange fluxes to capture potential hydrate-carbon cycle-climate feed-backs.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/en15093307</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210659</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The Effect of Adding Different Amount of Carbon Source on the Nitrogen Removal Efficiency of Tidal Flow Artificial Wetland</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Based on the small trial of tidal flow artificial wetland, alkali-treated corn straw is used as carbon source supplement for denitrification. The author studys the effect of adding different amount of carbon source on removal efficiency of TN, NH4+-N, NO3--N, NO2--N and COD in the system. The results of the study show that: when the adding amount of alkaline straw are 0, 100g and 400g, NH4+-N average removal efficiency are respectively 59.9\%, 66.96\% and 71.91\%; NO3--N average removal efficiency are respectively 54.89\%, 72.33\% and 81.36\%; NO2--N average removal efficiency are respectively 12.76\%, 24.91\% and 40.97\%; TN average removal efficiency are respectively 23.14\%, 41.32\% and 64\%; COD average removal efficiency are respectively 83.94\%, 81.29\% and 77.85\%. Alkali-treated corn straw can provide the carbon source that denitrification required for artificial wetland system. The added carbon source can significantly improve the nitrogen removal efficiency of the system, and the nitrogen removal efficiency of adding 400g alkali-treated corn straw is better than adding 100g alkali-treated corn straw, and it is not a burden for the system.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210662</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Acidification mediated by a river plume and coastal upwelling on a fringing reef at the east coast of Hainan Island, Northern South China Sea</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">We investigated the dynamics of carbonate system which was greatly modulated by a river plume and coastal upwelling in July 2014 and July 2015 at the east coast of Hainan Island where a fringing reef distributes inshore. By using a three end-member mixing model, we semiquantitatively estimated the removal of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) mediated by biological production in the river plume and upwelled water to be 13 +/- 17 and 15 +/- 16 mu mol kg(-1), respectively. The enhanced organic production was mainly responsible for these DIC consumptions in both two regimes, however, nearly a half of DIC removal was attributed to biocalcification in the plume system while it was negligible in the upwelling system. Furthermore, the modeled results over reefs revealed that river plume and coastal upwelling were two major threats of acidification to coral communities at the east coast of Hainan Island during cruises. In comparison, the biological contribution to acidification was limited for balancing between organic production and biocalcification during July 2014 cruise, whereas the acidification was greatly intensified by organic degradation during July 2015 cruise. It was verified that naturally local acidification (physical and biological processes) played a major role in great pH decreases on a short-term scale, leading to coastal waters more vulnerable to anthropogenic ocean acidification (uptake of atmospheric CO2) by reducing buffering capacity of waters. Finally, effects of acidification associated with other local threats on a fringing reef were further depicted with a conceptual model.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1002/2017JC013228</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210667</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Simulation of an offshore wind turbine using a weakly-compressible CFD solver coupled with a blade element turbine model</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The present study addresses the first steps of development and validation of a coupled CFD-BE (Blade Element) simulation tool dedicated to offshore wind turbine farm modelling.

The utilization of living biofilms isolated from local environments is an effective strategy for infrastructure protection. In this study, three aerobic marine bacteria, Tenacibaculum mesophilum D-6, Tenacibaculum litoreum W-4, and Bacillus sp. Y-6, with strong biofilmforming abilities were isolated and evaluated for the corrosion protection of X80 carbon steel. The corrosion inhibitory effect of the bacteria was found to be closely related to their biofilmforming abilities. This conclusion was corroborated by biofilm characterization, electrochemical tests, weight loss analysis, and corrosion product analysis. Moreover, secreted extracellular polymeric substances were identified to play significant roles in corrosion inhibition.

However, there could be economical and environmental benefits of reducing the footprint. In the last decades, more focus has been given to synthetic mooring lines and different mooring layouts to optimize the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for offshore renevable energy converters such as wave energy converters. Therefore, this work presents a parametric study of two important parameters, namely the mooring line angle and line pretension, for a taut mooring configuration focusing on the dynamic response when applied to the TetraSpar floating foundation compared to a catenary mooring system. The work is based on experimental results conducted in the wave basin at Aalborg University (AAU) and compared to analytical stiffness calculations. In addition, a numerical model was tuned based on the main dynamics to achieve the tension response. The results showed satisfying dynamic behavior where the angle and pretension mainly influenced the surge and yaw natural periods. The motion response showed similar behavior between the chosen parameters, and larger pitch amplitudes were found compared to the catenary system.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/jmse8060431</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210696</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">A numerical study on behavior of single CO2 droplet released into the ocean</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The dynamics of single liquefied CO2 droplet released into the seawater to conduct the fundamental design for a new concept, COSMOS, was studied. This concept is proposed to contribute to sequestration and storage of CO2 in the deep part of the ocean for injecting liquefied CO2 droplets onto the sea bottom from an injection nozzle installed by an offshore floating system structure, as one of the options for mitigating the global warming effect. These CO2 droplets are made by a mixture of liquefied CO2 and dry ice at the CO2 triple point (0.52 MPa and 216.6 K), with density typically larger than that of the seawater. A numerical assessment to conduct the feasibility study by investigating fluid dynamics of liquefied CO2 in the turbulent seawater was presented. The effect of turbulence distorted the droplet very rapidly and violently, in particular under large gravitational effect.

To investigate the sciences and technologies concerned with it, Research Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth (RITE) initiated a research and development project for CO2 geological sequestration. The field experiment had been conducted at Nagaoka, Japan. For this technology, one of the geophysical dynamics additionally induced to the original geosystem is the dissolution of injected CO2 into the reservoir water, which is a way for storage. The density of dissolved water is changed leading to a gravity flow. This flow can make contribution to the evolution of CO2 enriched water in the terms of buoyancy. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This article is focused on the use of PEM fuel cells, which are currently the most common in maritime sector. The often use of PEM fuel cells is also because of international and regional regulations, which require significant reduction of emissions. Operation of PEM fuel cells onboard vessel brings potential risk, however when safety countermeasures are ensured PEM fuel cells are safe to use as well as any other power sources. Vessels are typically equipped with either AC grid or DC grid. Both has different benefits, which are useful in certain applications. Due to that, PEM fuel cells must be able to be integrated into AC and DC grid.

Here we explore whether negative emissions are indeed effective in reversing climate change on human timescales, given the potentially counteracting effect of natural carbon sinks and the inertia of the climate system. We designed a range of CO2 emission scenarios, which follow a gradual transition to a zero-carbon energy system and entail implementation of various amounts of net-negative emissions at technologically plausible rates. These scenarios are used to force an Earth System Model of intermediate complexity. Results suggest that while it is possible to revert to a desired level of warming (e.g. 2 Â°C above pre-industrial) after different levels of overshoot, thermosteric sea level rise is not reversible for at least several centuries, even under assumption of large amounts of negative CO2 emissions. During the net-negative emission phase, artificial CO2 removal is opposed by CO2 outgassing from natural carbon sinks, with the efficiency of CO2 removal - here defined as the drop in atmospheric CO2 per unit negative emission - decreasing with the total amount of negative emissions.

High fidelity analysis techniques like 3D finite element modeling are used alongside beam models of wind turbine blades to characterize the resulting designs in terms of their aeroelastic performance as well as their ability to resist damage growth. This study considers a common damage type for wind turbine blades, the bond line failure, and explores the damage tolerance of the designs to gain insight into how to improve bond line failure through aeroelastic design. Flat-back airfoils are also explored to improve the damage tolerance performance of trailing-edge bond line failures. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

To follow the direct and indirect effects of thermocline shifts on processes at the sediment-water interface, the thermoclines in six of twelve lake enclosures were deepened by pumping warm surface water below the thermocline. Hypolimnetic temperatures increased and oxygen concentrations decreased due to the treatment. Path modeling suggests a correlation of the treatment to epilimnetic chlorophytes and hypolimnetic diatoms, while the dominant cryptophytes and cyanobacteria remained unaffected by the treatment. Sedimentation rates, ranging between 0.1 and 1.9 g m(-2) day(-1) per enclosure, correlated strongly with the selected phytoplankton groups, but were not affected by the treatment. Concentrations of elements (Ba, Mn, S, Sr), nutrients (NH4 (+), PO4 (3-), Si), and greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) in the upper centimeter of the sediment were not affected by the hypolimnetic changes. Methane and carbon dioxide emission from the enclosures to the atmosphere were negligible. Bacterial and viral abundance in sediments were not affected by the treatment. Results suggest that the benthic ecosystem remains unaffected by slight changes in the pelagial. Further, we conclude that short-term warming does not increase greenhouse gas emissions from temperate, deep, oligo-mesotrophic lakes.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s10750-017-3202-7</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210734</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Biome-specific scaling of ocean productivity, temperature, and carbon export efficiency</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Mass conservation and metabolic theory place constraints on how marine export production (EP) scales with net primary productivity (NPP) and sea surface temperature (SST); however, little is empirically known about how these relationships vary across ecologically distinct ocean biomes. Here we compiled in situ observations of EP, NPP, and SST and used statistical model selection theory to demonstrate significant biome-specific scaling relationships among these variables. Multiple statistically similar models yield a threefold variation in the globally integrated carbon flux (~4â€“12 Pg C yrâˆ’1) when applied to climatological satellite-derived NPP and SST. Simulated NPP and SST input variables from a 4Ã—CO2 climate model experiment further show that biome-specific scaling alters the predicted response of EP to simulated increases of atmospheric CO2. These results highlight the need to better understand distinct pathways of carbon export across unique ecological biomes and may help guide proposed efforts for in situ observations of the ocean carbon cycle.

One such system treats seawater for injection into the reservoir. As reservoir waters often contain elevated concentrations of barium or calcium, treatment systems need membranes to remove any sulfates that may form in the seawater before it is injected into the reservoir, in order to avoid severe scaling. SPRINGS (Subsea PRocess and INjection Gear for Seawater) is a collaboration project between Total, Saipem, Veolia Water and VWS Westgarth. It was initiated in 2007 and aims to provide robust solutions featuring the use of membranes for treating seawater on the sea bed in deepwater areas. SPRINGS has now reached qualification stage and a first industrial application is planned for 2015. This paper describes the SPRINGS development project, including an update on the latest progress to date. It presents a specific case study conducted in the Gulf of Guinea which illustrates the commercial and technological advantages, along with the limitations, of deploying this technology for future remote applications. It compares the conventional field architecture utilized in conjunction with water injection from FPSO topsides with the architecture required for a SPRINGS solution on the ocean floor. The information provided allows operators to consider an alternative development strategy for the application of membranes to water injection in remote satellite fields.

The current study quantified these impacts in the Puttalam lagoon, an area of the country that has experienced some of the most destructive development. Land use change was analysed using a multi-temporal set of aerial and satellite images taken in 1992/1994 (aerial photographs), 2007 (SPOT 5) and 2012 (Pleiades). The area of shrimp farms increased by 2777% over this 19-year period, with salt pans expanding by 60%. Mangroves declined in area by 34% and coconut groves increased by 17%. Because of problems with disease many intensive shrimp farms are abandoned after a few years, leaving denuded and unproductive landscapes; here a large majority of farms (90% of the total area of shrimp aquaculture) were found to be abandoned. The loss of carbon sequestration and storage services caused by this unsustainable recent history of shrimp farming was calculated as one measure of environmental impact. The documented land use changes in Puttalam lagoon resulted in an estimated net carbon loss of 191584tC. This was mainly due to conversion of mangroves to shrimp farms, making up 75.5% of the total carbon loss. These results demonstrate the scale of environmental degradation caused by intensive shrimp farming in the study area, and highlight the need for an entirely new aquaculture model in Sri Lanka.

Understanding how species can cope with the changes in seawater carbonate chemistry represents a challenging issue. We addressed this topic using underwater CO2 vents that naturally acidify some marine areas off the island of Ischia. In the most acidified area of the vents, having a mean pH value of 6.7, comparable to far-future predicted acidification scenarios (by 2300), the biomass is dominated by the brown alga Sargassum vulgare. The novelty of the present study is the characterization of the S. vulgare proteome together with metabolite analyses to identify the key proteins, metabolites, and pathways affected by ocean acidification. A total of 367 and 387 proteins were identified in populations grown at pH that approximates the current global average (8.1) and acidified sites, respectively. Analysis of their relative abundance revealed that 304 proteins are present in samples from both sites: 111 proteins are either higher or exclusively present under acidified conditions, whereas 120 proteins are either lower or present only under control conditions. Functionally, under acidification, a decrease in proteins related to translation and post-translational processes and an increase of proteins involved in photosynthesis, glycolysis, oxidation-reduction processes, and protein folding were observed. In addition, small-molecule metabolism was affected, leading to a decrease of some fatty acids and antioxidant compounds under acidification. Overall, the results obtained by proteins and metabolites analyses, integrated with previous transcriptomic, physiological, and biochemical studies, allowed us to delineate the molecular strategies adopted by S. vulgare to grow in future acidified environments, including an increase of proteins involved in energetic metabolism, oxidation-reduction processes, and protein folding at the expense of proteins involved in translation and post-translational processes.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1111/mec.16553</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210773</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The Bloom-Forming Macroalgae, Ulva, Outcompetes the Seagrass, Zostera marina, Under High CO2 Conditions</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">While multiple species of macroalgae and seagrass can benefit from elevated CO2 concentrations, competition between such organisms may influence their ultimate responses. This study reports on experiments performed with a Northwest Atlantic species of the macroalgae, Ulva, and the seagrass, Zostera marina, grown under ambient and elevated levels of pCO(2), and subjected to competition with each other. When grown individually, elevated pCO(2) significantly increased growth rates and productivity of Ulva and Zostera, respectively, beyond control treatments (by threefold and 27\%, respectively). For both primary producers, significant declines in tissue C-13 signatures suggested that increased growth and productivity were associated with a shift from use of HCO3- toward CO2 use. When grown under higher pCO(2), Zostera experienced significant increases in leaf and rhizome carbon content as well as significant increases in leaf carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, while sediments within which high CO(2)Zostera were grown had a significantly higher organic carbon content. When grown in the presence of Ulva; however, above- and below-ground productivity and tissue nitrogen content of Zostera were significantly lower, revealing an antagonistic interaction between elevated CO2 and the presence of Ulva. The presence of Zostera had no significant effect on the growth of Ulva. Collectively, this study demonstrates that while Ulva and Zostera can each individually benefit from elevated pCO(2) levels, the ability of Ulva to grow more rapidly and inhibit seagrass productivity under elevated pCO(2), coupled with accumulation of organic C in sediments, may offset the potential benefits for Zostera within high CO2 environments.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s12237-018-0437-0</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210781</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Ecosystem carbon exchange in two terrestrial ecosystem mesocosms under changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The ecosystem-level carbon uptake and respiration were measured under different CO2 concentrations in the tropical rainforest and the coastal desert of Biosphere 2, a large enclosed facility. When the mesocosms were sealed and subjected to step-wise changes in atmospheric CO2 between daily means of 450 and 900 Î¼mol mol-1, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 was derived using the diurnal changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The step-wise CO2 treatment was effectively replicated as indicated by the high repeatability of NEE measurements under similar CO2 concentrations over a 12-week period. In the rainforest mesocosm, daily NEE was increased significantly by the high CO2 treatments because of much higher enhancement of canopy CO2 assimilation relative to the increase in the nighttime ecosystem respiration under high CO2. Furthermore, the response of daytime NEE to increasing atmospheric CO2 in this mesocosm was not linear, with a saturation concentration of 750 Î¼mol mol-1. In the desert mesocosm, a combination of a reduction in ecosystem respiration and a small increase in canopy CO2 assimilation in the high CO2 treatments also enhanced daily NEE. Although soil respiration was not affected by the short-term change in atmospheric CO2 in either mesocosm, plant dark respiration was increased significantly by the high CO2 treatments in the rainforest mesocosm while the opposite was found in the desert mesocosm. The high CO2 treatments increased the ecosystem light compensation points in both mesocosms. High CO2 significantly increased ecosystem radiation use efficiency in the rainforest mesocosm, but had a much smaller effect in the desert mesocosm. The desert mesocosm showed much lower absolute response in NEE to atmospheric CO2 than the rainforest mesocosm, probably because of, the presence of C4 plants. This study illustrates the importance of large-scale experimental research in the study of complex global change issues.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s004420050765</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210782</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Are renewable energy technologies cost competitive for electricity generation?</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Renewable energy technologies (RETs), particularly solar and wind energy technologies, have experienced a rapid decline in their costs over the last two decades. Several studies claim that RETs are cost-competitive with fossil fuel technologies based on their levelized costs of electricity (LCOE), the most common indicator used to compare the cost competitiveness of electricity-generating technologies. However, no consensus exists due to the wide variations in factors influencing the LCOEs across countries and technologies. This study calculates more than 4000 LCOEs for 11 technologies, varying all input variables. It shows that the LCOEs for RETs, except concentrated solar and offshore wind, are lower than those for fossil fuel technologies at the lower range of capital costs and discount rates of 10% or lower. However, for a reasonable range of input variables, the study cannot justify the low auction prices for solar power, below US$20/MWh, recently observed in some parts of the world. The study illustrates how various factors influence the cost of electricity generation across technologies. It also compares the trends in electricity generation costs between RETs and fossil fuels over the last two decades.

The latter one calls high requirement of wave generation and calculation. In this paper, we establish a spatial domain model of fourth order nonlinear SchrÃ¶dinger (NLS) equation for describing deep-water wave trains in moving coordinate system. For the first purpose mentioned above, this paper presents the evolution of random wave trains in real sea state described by the Joint North Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP) power spectrum numerically, which is governed by the NLS equation. The parameters of the spectrum are evaluated to discuss their effect on the occurrence of rogue waves. For the second purpose to generate rogue waves in experimental tank efficiently, the transient wave is focused for its allowance of precise determination of concentration place/time. First we simulate the three-dimensional transient waves in the numerical tank modeling the deepwater basin with double-side multi-segmented wave-maker in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) with linear superposing theory. To discuss its nonlinearity for the guidance of experiment, the transient wave is set as the initial condition of the NLS equation and the difference from the linear simulation is presented, which could be given as the suggestion to the preparation of experiment.

In general, increasing either the oscillatory frequency or tidal volume increased CO2 elimination, but increasing the tidal volume had more effect. The relationship between these 3 variables was best described by a power law equation. Ventilatory frequencies and tidal volumes required to maintain eucapnia in the species studied were extrapolated from the results and, when technically possible, the potential of the technique to maintain eucapnia was tested in extended runs.

Italian Economic Development Minister Ivan Scalfarotto said that facilities off the Adriatic coast could be reused for wind and solar energy, or for monitoring the marine environment, seismic, tourism or wireless transmission. Liv Hovem, senior vice president Africa and Europe, DNV GL Oil &amp;amp; Gas at OMC, said that by taking various measures, oil and gas firms could reduce their CO2 footprints cost effectively, on average, by 29%. DNV GL has produced a tool to assess the opportunities, using what it calls a marginal abatement curve (MAC). This considers the cost per ton of CO2 of a measure and the overall CO2 emission reduction. One option is to use floating wind turbines to power subsea facilities, such as subsea water injection, specifically. DNV GL completed a feasibility study, with input from ExxonMobil, Eni and Statoil, on such a concept, based on a site in the North Sea. DNV GL targeted a 44,000 b/d concept, which would traditionally require a 3MW gas turbine on a platform.

One option proposed is to replace conventional marine fuels with cleaner fuels. This is particularly important for vessels engaged in short-sea shipping and inland waterway transportation because their exhaust gases more negatively affect the local population than long-distance ships do. Hence the aim of this study is to undertake a technical, environmental and economic analysis of alternative fuels to reduce the environmental footprint and lifetime costs of inland waterway transportation. The analysis will focus on Croatia whose existing outdated inland waterway fleet needs to meet the goals of the Low-Carbon Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia. In the study, a life-cycle analysis and life-cycle cost assessment of different alternative fuels will be performed taking into account the operating profiles and technical characteristics of vessels working in Croatia. The potential effects of a carbon tax are also examined in a case study considering carbon emissions reduction targets in Croatia by 2030. The electrification of ships is highlighted as the most environmentally friendly option for each considered ship, reaching a carbon emission reduction of up to 51\%, while the most cost-effective option varies for each ship.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.rser.2021.111363</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210796</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Extensive CO2 emissions from shallow coastal waters during passage of Hurricane Irene (August 2011) over the Mid-Atlantic Coast of the U.S.A.</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Shallow coastal waters serve an important role as long-term carbon (C) sinks because they capture terrestrial C and retain internally produced C in wetlands and sediments. We show that tropical cyclones (TCs) can lead to rapid CO2 efflux from estuaries, driven by physical and biogeochemical perturbation of these coastal C reservoirs, and that the magnitude of TC-driven CO2 emissions may offset C that accumulates over much longer timescales. In August 2011, Hurricane Irene passed over North Carolina's Neuse River Estuary-Pamlico Sound (NRE-PS), which is part of the second largest estuarine system in the U.S., the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound. Irene rapidly changed the NRE-PS system from a small CO2 sink to a large CO2 source. Irene-induced CO2 efflux from the NRE alone was at least four times the annual riverine C input and seven times the annual atmospheric CO2 uptake. The magnitude and duration of ecosystem disturbance from TCs vary with storm intensity and frequency but likely are qualitatively similar across many terrestrial and coastal systems. Consequently, altered TC activity under future climate scenarios may shift the balance between C accumulation in, and release from, coastal C reservoirs.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.4319/lo.2014.59.5.1651</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210801</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Assessing biological and chemical signatures related to nutrient removal by floating islands in stormwater mesocosms</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Aquatic floating plants on BioHaven mats were tested for their potential use as a Best Management Practice to be incorporated within existing stormwater detention ponds. Plants were analyzed for their capability to remove nutrient-pollution in parallel with the study of ecological dynamics. Experiments were carried out in cylindrical mesocosms of 5 m diameter and 1.2 m height, above-ground pools with a water volume of 14 m(3). The design parameters tested were for 5\% and 10\% vegetated floating island coverage of the mesocosm, both with and without shoreline plants called littoral zone. This littoral shelf was 0.5 m thick, graded at a downward slope of 1:5 toward the center using loamy soil with low organic matter content, excavated from below turf grass. Endemic plant species were chosen for the experimental location in central Florida based on a wetland identification manual by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to ensure the study was not compromised by unique climate requirements of the plants. Nutrient and aquatic chemical conditions such as pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, turbidity, and chlorophyll a were monitored to understand their relationships to the general wetland ecosystem. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis identified the microbial activity near the rhizospheric zone. Logistical placement considerations were made using spatial sampling across the horizontal plane of the mesocosms, beneath and around the root zone, to determine if nutrients tend to aggregate around the floating island. This study concluded that the application of floating islands as a stormwater technology can remove nutrients through plant uptake and biological activity. The most cost-effective size in the outdoor mesocosms was 5\% surface area coverage of the mat. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A novel metric linking this future growth to policy decisions today is the mitigation delay sensitivity (MDS), but MDS estimates for Earth system variables other than peak temperature (Delta T-max) are missing. Using an Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity, we show that the current emission increase rate causes a Delta T-max increase roughly 3-7.5 times as fast as observed warming, and a millenial steric sea level rise (SSLR) 7-25 times as fast as observed SSLR, depending on the achievable rate of emission reductions after the peak of emissions. These ranges are only slightly affected by the uncertainty range in equilibrium climate sensitivity, which is included in the above values. The extent of ocean acidification at the end of the century is also strongly dependent on the starting time and rate of emission reductions. The preservable surface ocean area with sufficient aragonite supersaturation for coral reef growth is diminished globally at an MDS of roughly 25\%-80\% per decade. A near-complete loss of this area becomes unavoidable if mitigation is delayed for a few years to decades. Also with respect to aragonite, 12\%-18\% of the Southern Ocean surface become undersaturated per decade, if emission reductions are delayed beyond 2015-2040. We conclude that the consequences of delaying global emission reductions are much better captured if the MDS of relevant Earth system variables is communicated in addition to current trends and total projected future changes.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1088/1748-9326/11/1/014010</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210807</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Effective EEDI performance achievement by MAN B and W G-Type ultra long stroke marine diesel engine: A review</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Man Diesel &amp;amp; Turbo G-Type ultra long stroke marine diesel engine was introduced in October 2010.This ultra long stroke means it has been designed to have reduced engine speeds and there by achieving high efficiency ships with reduced fuel consumption as well as reduced CO2 emissions.

In this process, CO2 is captured and injected into geological formations for permanent storage. The injected plume and its migration within the reservoir is carefully monitored, using geophysical methods. While it is considered unlikely that the injected CO2 should escape the reservoir and reach the marine environment, marine monitoring is required to verify that there are no indications of leakage, and to detect and quantify leakage if it should occur. Marine monitoring is challenging because of the considerable area to be covered, the limited spatial and temporal extent of a potential leakage event, and the considerable natural variability in the marine environment. In this review, we summarize marine monitoring strategies developed to ensure adequate monitoring of the marine environment without introducing prohibitive costs. We also provide an overview of the many different technologies applicable to different aspects of marine monitoring of geologically stored carbon.

However, allowing the accumulation of metabolic CO2(aq) results in pH reduction, thereby reducing the fraction of NH3 from TAN. Such operation strategy may allow increasing the design criteria for TAN, which can result in reduced water flow requirements in flow-through systems. In this study, growth parameters of sea bream Sparus aurata grown in high TAN and low pH values, were monitored. TAN toxicity was first tested in 27-1 aquariums, where sea bream fingerlings were grown in TAN values of up to 20 mg N l(-1) and pH 6.8, without showing any significant negative effects. Following that, two 100 m(3) marine fish-culture tanks were stocked with 84 g fish and supplied with the same daily feed for 250 days. Liquid oxygen enrichment was affected and paddlewheel aerators were used for CO2 stripping. Seawater was supplied to the high TAN experimental system at an average rate of 5.25 m(3) (kg feed)(-1) and to a control tank at an average rate of 22.9 m(3) (kg feed)(-1) (normal flow-through practice). The experimental system included a solids filter, but not a nitrification unit. TAN concentrations measured in the experimental system were much higher than those in the control system (5.44 +/- 1.2 mg N land 1.34 +/- 0.6 mg N l(-1) on average, respectively), however fish growth and fish mortality rates in both systems were statistically identical. The inorganic carbon mass balance differed significantly between the two systems emphasizing the important role of the CO2 stripping device. The choice of stripping device allows controlling the CO2(aq) concentration, which in turn controls the pH value for a given alkalinity value. Such control over the CO2(aq) concentration enables operating the system at relatively high TAN concentrations while maintaining NH3(aq) below the threshold concentration. An aquatic-chemistry model was developed to predict pH value, and consequently CO2(aq) and NH3(aq) concentrations, assuming steady state conditions. Model results were used to determine the minimal makeup water flow-rate that would allow safe operation with regard to the threshold metabolite concentrations. Model results indicated that under the conditions tested, a flow-through system could be operated safely with a ratio as low as 4.4 m(3) seawater (kg feed)(-1) with no need for a nitrification biofilter. The implications of growing fish at high TAN concentrations are extensive, the most important being a significant reduction in water treatment costs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The optical schematic diagram is shown at first to describe how the polarized light is launched and the scattered polarizations are measured. The concept profile and physical image of the prototype and its battery are shown. The prototype was deployed in the Daya Bay (at the edge of South China Sea) in December, 2017. The data showed that the polarization parameters of particles in two deployment sites were quite different. And moreover, the polarization parameters normalized by the intensity, can characterize the difference between the particles in two sites.

Here we use a semi-empirical model, calibrated with sea-level data of the past millennium, to estimate the SLR implications of holding warming below 2 Â°C or 1.5 Â°C above pre-industrial temperature, as mentioned in the CancÃºn Agreements. Limiting warming to these levels with a probability larger than 50% produces 75-80 cm SLR above the year 2000 by 2100. This is 25 cm below a scenario with unmitigated emissions, but 15 cm above a hypothetical scenario reducing global emissions to zero by 2016. The long-term SLR implications of the two warming goals diverge substantially on a multi-century timescale owing to inertia in the climate system and the differences in rates of SLR by 2100 between the scenarios. By 2300 a 1.5 Â°C scenario could peak sea level at a median estimate of 1.5 m above 2000. The 50% probability scenario for 2 Â°C warming would see sea level reaching 2.7 m above 2000 and still rising at about double the present-day rate. Halting SLR within a few centuries is likely to be achieved only with the large-scale deployment of CO2 removal efforts, for example, combining large-scale bioenergy systems with carbon capture and storage.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1038/nclimate1584</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210840</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">An experimental description of the double positive effect of CO2 injection in methane hydrate deposits in terms of climate change mitigation</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">In this paper, the possibility of injecting CO2 into a hydrate reservoir, with the only aim of preventing methane release was investigated. Pure methane hydrates were formed and then partially dissociated, due to a provoked temperature increase of 2 degrees C. The same procedure was applied to a system composed by a core of CO2 hydrates and an external shell made with CO2 hydrates. In tests with only methane hydrate, that temperature increase caused partial hydrate dissociation, with a consequent increase in pressure about 7.81-8.42 bar. In presence of CO2 hydrate, the same temperature increase did not cause any dissociation, even if the new established condition were not suitable for CH4 hydrates stability. Results proved that CO2 is capable to form a strong hydrate shell around the methane core, which hinders its dissociation. Two positive contributions were reached: CO2 permanent storage and the prevention of CH4 release in the atmosphere. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

GIS-based viewshed analysis is the most widely used technique to address visual impacts. However, despite the wide application its spatial extent remains limited to local and regional studies. This study presents a GIS-based model for cumulative visual impact assessment on macro-regional scale based on a case study for the Baltic Sea. The viewshed model was deployed over a visibility zone covering 54% (223.641 km2) of the Baltic Sea space using a database of 63,672 observation points integrated by geospatial data on existing and planned sea uses representing potential visual stressors. Results show that areas of highest potential visual impact are sheltered coastal areas with complex geomorphological features such as barrier islands, peninsulas, straits, archipelagos and lagoons in combination with intensive anthropogenic activity and presence of nature protected areas. The methodology can be applied to any coastal area of the world to classify coastal areas due to their cumulative viewshed characteristics and as early monitoring tool for visual impact assessment on transboundary scale.

An anthropogenically induced increase in seawater CO2 reduces the HCO3 â€“ requirement of diatoms, potentially saving intracellular energy and benefitting their growth. This effect is commonly speculated to be most remarkable in larger diatoms that are subject to a stronger limitation of CO2 supply because of their smaller surface-to-volume ratios. However, we constructed a theoretical model for diatoms and revealed a unimodal relationship between the simulated growth rate response (GRR, the ratio of growth rates under elevated and ambient CO2) and cell size, with the GRR peaking at a cell diameter of âˆ¼7 Î¼m. The simulated GRR of the smallest diatoms was low because the CO2 supply was nearly sufficient at the ambient level, while the decline of GRR from a cell diameter of 7 Î¼m was simulated because the contribution of seawater CO2 to the total carbon demand greatly decreased and diatoms became less sensitive to CO2 increase. A collection of historical data in CO2 enrichment experiments of diatoms also showed a roughly unimodal relationship between maximal GRR and cell size. Our model further revealed that the â€œoptimalâ€&#x9d; cell size corresponding to peak GRR enlarged with the magnitude of CO2 increase but diminished with elevating cellular carbon demand, leading to projection of the smallest optimal cell size in the equatorial Pacific upwelling zone. Last, we need to emphasize that the size-dependent effects of increasing CO2 on diatoms are multifaceted, while our model only considers the inorganic carbon supply from seawater and optimal allocation of intracellular energy. Our study proposes a competitive advantage of middle-sized diatoms and can be useful in projecting changes in the diatom community in the future acidified high-CO2 ocean.

Previous studies on the genus Trichodesmium suggested a strong sensitivity towards ocean acidification. In view of the large functional diversity in N-2 fixers, the objective of this study was to improve our knowledge of the CO2 responses of other diazotrophs. To this end, the single-celled Cyanothece sp. and two heterocystous species, Nodularia spumigena and the symbiotic Calothrix rhizosoleniae, were acclimated to two pCO(2) levels (380 vs. 980 mu atm). Growth rates, cellular composition (carbon, nitrogen and chlorophyll a) as well as carbon and N-2 fixation rates (C-14 incorporation, acetylene reduction) were measured and compared to literature data on different N-2 fixers. The three species investigated in this study responded differently to elevated pCO(2), showing enhanced, decreased as well as unaltered growth and production rates. For instance, Cyanothece increased production rates with pCO(2), which is in line with the general view that N-2 fixers benefit from ocean acidification. Due to lowered growth and production of Nodularia, nitrogen input to the Baltic Sea might decrease in the future. In Calothrix, no significant changes in growth or production could be observed, even though N-2 fixation was stimulated under elevated pCO(2). Reviewing literature data confirmed a large variability in CO2 sensitivity across diazotrophs. The contrasting response patterns in our and previous studies were discussed with regard to the carbonate chemistry in the respective natural habitats, the mode of N-2 fixation as well as differences in cellular energy limitation between the species. The group-specific CO2 sensitivities will impact differently on future biogeochemical cycles of open-ocean environments and systems like the Baltic Sea and should therefore be considered in models estimating climate feedback effects.

The estimation used allometric equations that employ tree type and diameter at breast height. The carbon content in sediment was also evaluated using the ignition method. Results showed that the estimated value of standing carbon stock in the Mangunharjo mangrove ecosystem is 152.85 ton he. The highest value (i.e., 68.1 ton ha(-1)) is observed in the area near the river, which is dominated by the Avicennia marina species with a density of 733 ind ha(-1). The lowest value (i.e., 34.69 ton ha(-1)) is observed in the area near the residential area with the A. marina species density of 333.26 ind ha(-1). Sediment carbon stocks in all stations amounted to 236.07 ton ha(-1). The amount of carbon in sediment is influenced by the sediment type, vegetation type, and sediment age.

Three types of pCO(2) sensors (fluorescence, NDIR and ISFET-based technologies) were used in combination with multiparameter instruments measuring oxygen, temperature, salinity and currents in the water column at the epicentre of release and further away. It was shown that distribution of seafloor CO2 emissions features high spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The highest pCO(2) values (similar to 1250 mu atm) were detected at low tide around a bubble stream and within centimetres distance from the seafloor. Further up in the water column, 30-100 cm above the seabed, the gradients decreased, but continued to indicate elevated pCO(2) at the epicentre of release throughout the injection campaign with the peak values between 400 and 740 mu atm. High-frequency parallel measurements from two instruments placed within 1 m from each other, relocation of one of the instruments at the release site and 2D horizontal mapping of the release and control sites confirmed a localized impact from CO2 emissions. Observed effects on the water column were temporary and post-injection recovery took &lt;7 days. A multivariate statistical approach was used to recognize the periods when the system was dominated by natural forcing with strong correlation between variation in pCO(2) and O-2, and when it was influenced by purposefully released CO2. Use of a hydrodynamic circulation model, calibrated with in situ data, was crucial to establishing background conditions in this complex and dynamic shallow water system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The bioavailability and subsequent biogeochemical effects of this sediment-derived DOM are unclear. To investigate those, we collected a sediment pore-water DOM (SDOM) sample and its overlying seawater to conduct a bioassay experiment, which allowed tracking of both short-term and long-term microbial processes in the context of DOM transformations. Short-term incubation results show that the SDOM extract supported the growth of specific taxa. The microbial community composition changed dramatically and an approximately 50\% of SDOM-derived carbon was consumed within the first 2 days. Viruses likely played a role in promoting bacterial community succession, further enhancing transformation of this SDOM. Long-term incubation results show that labile DOM was gradually consumed, while approximately 16\% of the initial SDOM appeared to be recalcitrant to microbial utilization and remained at the end (after 110 days) of the incubation experiment. Despite the short-term drastic changes in microbial community composition, a highly diverse microbial community is similar to the control at the end of the incubation. It is suggested here that resuspension of coastal sediments weakens their role as a net sink of carbon, with most of the mobilized SDOM transformed by successive microbial communities in the overlying seawater and the remaining recalcitrant organic material becoming part of the long-lived DOM pool. Thus, the bioavailability of the coastal SDOM might influence the carbon budget in coastal oceans.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1029/2019JG005212</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210145</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Carbonic Anhydrase as a Biomarker of Global and Local Impacts: Insights from Calcifying Animals</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The emission of greenhouse gases has grown in unprecedented levels since the beginning of the industrial era. As a result, global climate changes, such as heightened global temperature and ocean acidification, are expected to negatively impact populations. Similarly, industrial and urban unsustainable development are also expected to impose local impacts of their own, such as environmental pollution with organic and inorganic chemicals. As an answer, biomarkers can be used in environmental programs to assess these impacts. These tools are based in the quantification of biochemical and cellular responses of target species that are known to respond in a sensitive and specific way to such stresses. In this context, carbonic anhydrase has shown to be a promising biomarker candidate for the assessment of global and local impacts in biomonitoring programs, especially in marine zones, such as coral reefs, considering the pivotal role of this enzyme in the calcification process. Therefore, the aim of this review is to show the recent advances in the carbonic anhydrase research and the reasons why it can be considered as a promising biomarker to be used for calcifying organisms.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/ijms20123092</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210151</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Development of floating offshore wind turbine and the mooring system</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The offshore wind turbine, especially the floating offshore wind turbine in the deep sea is a perspective technology in the context of increasing energy demands.

Due to higher and more consistent wind speeds, offshore wind farms (OWFs) have the potential to generate more energy at a steadier rate than their onshore counterpart. However, at the collection system level, all the OWFs use alternating current (AC) technology at present. Nonetheless, with an increasing capacity of the single wind turbine (WT) and larger distances to the shore, the use of direct current (DC) technology at the collection system level is beneficial. To select a suitable DC collection system topology, this paper proposes a comprehensive analytical reliability evaluation method, based on the Universal Generating Function technique, together with associated economic factors. Four candidates DC collection system options were evaluated with different WT capacities for a 400 MW OWF. The availability indices such as Generation Ratio Availability and Expected Energy Not Supplied were used to assess their reliability levels. The results show that the radial topology with a single platform DC/DC converter is more reliable and economical than the other candidate options.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/en14102922</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210141</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Combining CPTU and UMASW to characterise Irish offshore deposits</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The north Irish Sea is earmarked for the development of several offshore wind farms. The complex Quaternary history of this area has resulted in a legacy of geotechnically challenging deposits, including heterogeneous glacial deposits, soft sediments and gas-charged sediments. Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) is commonly used onshore to produce shear wave velocity (Vs) profiles and is increasingly being used offshore (UMASW). When used in tandem with in-situ Cone Penetration Testing (CPTU) profiles it is a powerful tool for characterising offshore deposits. UMASW profiles were obtained from sites across the north Irish Sea coincident with CPTU profiles. Vs profiles from UMASW show good agreement with CPTU parameters in a range of geological settings. The purpose of this paper is to present a characterisation of geological deposits using a combined approach of CPTU and UMASW. By doing so the aim is to further develop classification charts that can give reliable characterisations of offshore deposits by combing non-invasive geophysical techniques and traditional CPTU.

The design of the conversion system aims for a high efficiency and low weight and volume.

The system is intended for a DC collection grid of turbines connected in series. Three different AC-AC converters are considered: the direct and indirect matrix converter and the back-to-back converter. The design of the entire conversion system is presented with emphasis on the converter and the high frequency transformer. The efficiencies of these two components as well as filters are assessed using a simulation model of the conversion system and device datasheet for the converter and analytical analysis for the transformer and filters. The conversion systems with the three converters show comparable efficiency performance; the system with the matrix converter however displaying the highest efficiency of 96.53\%, the indirect matrix converter 86.4\% and the back-to-back the lowest, 96.36\% or 93.51\% depending on the filter design. This paper is the prequel to a second part where the conversion system is further developed to improve the converter efficiency and the transformer design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the western Arctic, Ocean, the focus of this paper the Chukchir Sea is a Ocean sink for CO2 compensated for by outgassing of CO2 from the East Siberian Sea shelf. The Arctic marine carbon cycle and exchange of CO2 between the ocean and atmosphere appear particularly sensitive to environmental changes, including sea ice loss, warming, changes in seasonal marine phytoplankton primary production, changes in ocean circulation and freshwater inputs, and even the impacts of ocean acidification. In the near term, further sea ice loss, increases in phytoplankton growth rates, and other environmental and physical changes in the Arctic are expected to cause a limited net increase in the uptake of CO2 by Arctic surface waters. Recent studies suggest that this enhanced uptake will be short lived, with surface waters rapidly warming and equilibrating with the atmosphere. Furthermore, release of large stores of carbon from the surrounding Arctic landmasses through rivers into the Arctic Ocean and further warming over the next century may alter the Arctic from a CO2 sink to a source over the next century.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.5670/oceanog.2011.71</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210292</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Fuels, oils, and emissions: SMM discussion on emissions issues</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">A range of company views and future trends are presented during the 2008 CIMAC Circle at the SMM exhibition in Hamburg, Germany.

Tidal flat measurements were done using a flux chamber, and ship borne measurements using an equillbrator to determine the partial pressure of CO2 In the water. A strong response of CO2 exchange rate on Irradiance changes was observed at the tidal flat surface, with generally strong uptake of CO 2 during daylight conditions and release; presumably due to respiration, during dark conditions. the rate of respiration appeared to increase with temperature. Daytime CO2 uptake tended to be higher than nighttime release all year round. Apparently, tidal flats in temperate regions of the globe may be a sink for CO2 on an annual basis. In contrast to terrestrial CO2 exchange, uptake by processes active on and In tidal flats responds only slowly to changing irradiance. This Slow reaction Is attributed to CO2 storage In wet soli. Measurements In the water between tidal flats suggest that the estuarlne, open water part of the Wadden Sea Is a source of CO2 in spring.

Slow progress in emissions reduction to mitigate climate change is resulting in increased attention to what is called geoengineering, climate engineering, or climate intervention - deliberate interventions to counter climate change that seek to either modify the Earth's radiation budget or remove greenhouse gases such as CO2 from the atmosphere. When focused on CO2, the latter of these categories is called carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Future emission scenarios that stay well below 2 degrees C, and all emission scenarios that do not exceed 1.5 degrees C warming by the year 2100, require some form of CDR. At present, there is little consensus on the climate impacts and atmospheric CO2 reduction efficacy of the different types of proposed CDR. To address this need, the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (or CDRMIP) was initiated. This project brings together models of the Earth system in a common framework to explore the potential, impacts, and challenges of CDR. Here, we describe the first set of CDRMIP experiments, which are formally part of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). These experiments are designed to address questions concerning CDR-induced climate ``reversibility{'' the response of the Earth system to direct atmospheric CO2 removal (direct air capture and storage), and the CDR potential and impacts of afforestation and reforestation, as well as ocean alkalinization.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.5194/gmd-11-1133-2018</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210339</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Emissions fuel discussions at Gothenburg conference</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The 30th Motorship Propulsion Conference that will be held in Gotheburg on 21-22 May, 2008, is aimed at discussing significant topics related to emission fuels.

Sequential CO2 mineralization is a promising technology to address both issues. This paper reports the effects of key reaction parameters in this process, namely additional agitation of the reactant phases, presence of electrolytes, and CO2 microbubble injection rate. It was found that enhanced mass transport of reactants under agitation and an appropriate CO2 microbubble injection rate are necessary for effective CO2 mineralization by precipitating carbonate minerals. Compared to deionized water, various electrolytes in the brine reduced the amount of CO2 required to achieve the same Mg conversion ratio. However, deionized water led to a much higher purity (98\%) of the precipitated hydromagnesite, a valuable product of sequential CO2 mineralization. This report provides useful guidelines for the design of systems for sequential CO2 mineralization with seawater desalination brine.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.desal.2021.115309</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210372</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Heat recovery from sulfuric acid plants for seawater desalination using RO and MED systems</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Conforming to the factor characteristics of electricityâ€“water cogeneration power plants, an improved multieffect desalination (MED) and reverse osmosis (RO) are the most current techniques for seawater desalination. A principal change between these operations consists of their various energy requirements, thermal energy for MED and mechanical energy for RO plants. The main improvement ideas of RO and MED are the recovery of large quantities of heat produced during the production of sulfuric acid, which exhibits an exothermic reaction where a part of this heat will be used for the thermal power plant and subsequently reverse osmosis and another amount of heat recovery system will be used to desalinate seawater by the MED system. In this work, the sulfuric acid is used to recover heat energy; this energy is used in a hybrid system of ROâ€“MED in order to desalinate the seawater. A thermodynamic steady-state study of this system is investigated to select the optimum cogeneration system. These improvements could make the benefits of cogeneration to the energy consumption of an RO and MED which will be remarkably reduced.

Recently, the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) of the United States Department of Energy has begun to support an enhanced oil recovery project at the SACROC field in north central Texas, working in close collaboration with the Bureau of Economic Geology in Austin, Texas. The project requires the injection of CO2 at a depth of approximately 2040 meters into a reef structure. This project involves both repeat reflection seismic surveys and rock physics based analysis of core material. In the SACROC field, hydrocarbons were flooded out using water, and will be flooded with liquid CO2 during the summer of 2008. An experiment is planned whereby we first image fluid floods through reservoir rock using a CT scanner at NETL in order to see what the residual saturations of the previous fluids are. We then plan to conduct velocity measurements in this order, so that we can obtain a good estimate of conditions in different parts of the reservoir. We will then measure the P and S wave velocities, porosity, and permeability at varying pressures and temperatures that simulate reservoir conditions after each successive flood. In addition to velocity measurements, we will measure porosity, permeability, Young's Modulus, Poisson's ratio, and stress and strain measurement under simulated in situ reservoir conditions. Preliminary P and S wave velocity measurements were made in dry Berea sandstone samples in order to have a base reference material to compare our results to. Our Berea measurements were 2402 m/s for Vp, 1688 m/s for Vs, and 0.703 for Vs/Vp for an unstressed sample, which agrees well with the literature. The measured velocities, the P and S waveforms, the velocity vs. confining pressure will be used to calibrate our acoustical measurements both in dry and saturated samples of the carbonate SACROC reservoir rock using oil, gas, water, and CO2. We then plan on doing the first of several seismic surveys in the SACROC field in west Texas. The first survey will be completed during the summer of 2008, and presented at this meeting. Using our velocity measurements, we hope to be able to discern the difference between areas of the reservoir rock that are saturated with different pore-filling phases. With repeated surveys over the next few years, we hope to be able to observe the area of extent of various floods of CO2 that are scheduled to be injected into several wells in the area using the laboratory measurements we collected.

The pressure buildup caused by such injections may impact a volume of the basin significantly larger than the CO2 plume itself In areas with hydrological settings similar to the Gulf Coast Basin, the perturbation of the flow-field in deep parts of the basin could result in brines or brackish water being pushed up-dip into unconfined sections of the same formations or into the capture zone of fresh-water wells. The premise of the current study is that the details of multiple-phase flow processes necessary to model the near field evolution of the CO2 plume are not necessary to describe the impact of the pressure anomaly on up-dip aquifers. This paper quantitatively explores conditions under which shallow groundwater would be impacted by up-dip displacement of brines, utilizing an existing carefully calibrated flow model. Modeling an injection of water, arguably equivalent to 50 million tons of CO2/year for 50 years resulted in an average water-table rise of similar to 1 in, with minor increase in stream baseflow and larger increase in ground water evapotranspiration, but no significant change in salinity.

This, it is argued, implies the wetlands are more resilient to future sea-level rise than previously thought and under conditions of continued acceleration, even more organic carbon will be stored. However, upon closer inspection, the study conclusions are flawed as they are based upon an inappropriate methodological approach to quantifying sediment and organic carbon accumulation rates and require an acceleration in the rate of historical (decades) sea-level rise of which there is limited evidence and no broad consensus.

Unlike inland watersheds, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was the dominant component of C flux from this coastal watershed and stable carbon isotope and chromophoric dissolved organic matter evidence indicated the estuary and sound were dominated by wetland-derived terrigenous organic matter sources for several months following the storm. Persistence of wetland-derived DOC enabled its degradation to carbon dioxide (CO2), which was supported by sea-to-air CO2 fluxes measured in the sound weeks after the storm. Under future increasingly extreme weather events such as Hurricane Matthew, and most recently Hurricane Florence (September 2018), degradation of terrestrial DOC in floodwaters could increase flux of CO2 from estuaries and coastal waters to the atmosphere. Plain Language Summary Recent hurricanes along the Southeastern and Gulf coasts of the United States have received much attention, because these extreme events have led to immense societal and economic impacts. Wetlands in coastal watersheds store large amounts of organic matter and upon flooding during extreme weather events are poised to release this material into adjacent rivers and estuaries where its decomposition can generate carbon dioxide. Alteration of carbon balances in these events can shift impacted coastal ecosystems from states of carbon sinks to carbon sources for periods of weeks to months. Understanding the balance between these states is important to our understanding of how, and how long, regional carbon cycling is impacted after such extreme weather events. A biweekly record of dissolved and particulate organic matter quantity and quality from a coastal watershed in North Carolina in the 3months following Hurricane Matthew in 2016 illustrated a major input of wetland carbon to coastal waters caused by this storm and its substantial lingering effect on coastal carbon cycling.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1029/2019GL082014</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210496</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">A model for estimating the carbon footprint of maritime transportation of Liquefied Natural Gas under uncertainty</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) in the global markets has changed significantly. As a result, industries have been forced to consider investing significantly in supply chains to achieve an efficient distribution of LNG for cost efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. To minimize the contribution of LNG maritime transportation to global climate change, there is a need to quantify the carbon footprints systematically. In this research, we developed a novel and practical model for estimating the carbon footprint for LNG maritime transport. Using the MATLAB program, an uncertainty-based carbon footprint accounting framework is created. The Monte Carlo simulation model is built to conduct a carbon footprint analysis while the main input parameters were changed within a reliable range. Later, a multivariate sensitivity analysis is performed using the Risk Solver software to estimate the most significant parameters on the net carbon footprints. The sensitivity analysis results showed that that steam process day and steaming fuel consumption are found to be the most sensitive parameters for the overall carbon footprint for both Laden and Ballast trips. Furthermore, it was found that the Q-Max vessel produces more carbon emissions when compared to the Q-Flex, although both are traveling the same distance and are using the same fuel type. The type of fuel is also significantly affecting the emission values due to the relevant carbon content in the fuel. Like the case of the two conventional vessels, the one that is running with the only LNG is found to have fewer emissions when compared to the one run with dual-mode.

The ammonia process (BAU case) has been labelled as a significant greenhouse gas (GHG) producer-mainly due to high energy demand and CO2 emissions. This places the process under substantial scrutiny in terms of its climate change impacts and thus, provides a strong case study for viable transition towards greater sustainable operations. Here we examine, for the first time, sustainable eco-park designs for the diversification of the ammonia industry utilizing industrial symbiosis. The network considers several carbon capture and utilization (CCU) applications as well as ammonia (NH3) integration to produce the following downstream products: NH3, urea, Urea Ammonium Nitrate (UAN), Melamine (Mel) and Methanol (MeOH). Our results demonstrate improved energy efficiency with the inclusion of MeOH while UAN decreases net energy demand. Economically, the incorporation of MeOH gave attractive returns on investment due to increased productivity. Insights into environmental sustainability, through the assessment of Planetary Boundaries (PBs), revealed high risk operations aligned to climate change and ocean acidification earth systems linked to BAU operations. These impacts improved considerably with the addition of MeOH, resulting in safe operations of the ammonia process, attributed to increased waste recovery. These results were further supported using Life Cycle Sustainability Assessments, highlighting the potential of the BAU + urea + UAN + Mel + MeOH eco-park design for enhanced sustainable development. Overall, the findings of our paper suggest that upcoming and existing ammonia facilities can exploit industrial symbiosis to achieve greater sustainability through diversification of process operations.

To assess the ecological resilience of aquafarms to nutrient influx, we investigated the redox homeostasis of benthic ecosystems using a marine oligochaete as a model benthic organism in aquaculture fields. Real-time monitoring of the redox potential of a model benthic ecosystem constructed in an electrochemical reactor allowed evaluation of the homeostatic response of the system to nutrient addition. Although the detrimental effects of overfeeding were confirmed by irreversible potential changes in the sediment, redox homeostasis was reinforced through a cooperative relationship between oligochaetes and sediment microorganisms. Specifically, the oligochaetes exhibited reversible changes in metabolism and body position in response to dynamic changes in the sediment potential between -300 and 500 mV, thereby promoting the decomposition of organic compounds. The potential-dependent changes in metabolism and body position were reproduced by artificially manipulating the sediment potential in electrochemical reactors. Given the importance of benthic animals in sustaining coastal ecosystems, the electrochemical monitoring and physiologic regulation of marine oligochaetes could offer an intriguing approach toward sustainable aquaculture.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3389/fmicb.2022.907703</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210572</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Analysis of Pollutant Emission Characteristics of Marine Diesel Engine Using Chemical Kinetics under the Background of Energy Shortage</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The study aims to reduce the environmental pollutants produced in the ship transportation in the environment of energy shortage, and realize the comprehensive development of energy saving and emission reduction. Based on the theoretical basis of chemical kinetics, a new type of NOx emission generation model of marine diesel engine was proposed according to the traditional HB model. Second, the combustion chemical kinetics of sulfide was described, on which the sulfide generation and emission model of marine diesel engine was proposed. Third, the characteristics of NO, N2O and SO2 were analyzed according to the emission model of NOx and sulfide generation in marine diesel engine. The results showed that when the crankshaft angle was 230Â° and 250Â°CA, the content of NO and N2O in the exhaust pipe of diesel engine had an obvious peak. The content of NO and N2O in the cylinder and exhaust pipe of diesel engine increased at the beginning. As the crankshaft angle increased, the content of both decreased gradually, and the trend of change in the cylinder was slower than that in the exhaust pipe. The SO2 content in the diesel cylinder kept stable after a small increase until it disappeared. The SO2 content in the exhaust pipe first increased and then decreased. When the crankshaft angle was 230Â°CA, the SO2 content in the exhaust pipe of the diesel engine had an obvious peak. The emission characteristics of nitrogen oxide and sulfide were consistent with the correct change trend, which conformed to the theoretical mechanism. In a word, the study provides a practical basis for energy conservation and emission reduction, development of low-carbon economy, and efficient use of energy.

Acute ocean acidification ``events{''} in the Pacific Northwest United States have jeopardized the \$270 million, 3200 jobs/year shellfish aquaculture industry in Washington State, and this has contributed to the state's broad-based, legislatively driven response to ocean acidification. Even though impacts from ocean acidification have yet to be felt in many locations, states, and regions are beginning to take action on the issue. In this paper, we present an array of actions that can be undertaken by communities or regions to address ocean acidification. The actions can be coupled, completed one at a time, or aligned with other environmental initiatives, and they can be tailored to the prevailing political or economic environment. We review which actions have been used by different U.S. states and identify common themes and popular choices. We close by suggesting combinations of conditions and clusters of activities that seem to promote rapid and sustained action. Cutting atmospheric carbon dioxide levels internationally is still the most comprehensive way to address ocean acidification, but this review shows that productive actions can still be taken at smaller scales to help marine resource-dependent communities adapt to existing ocean acidification and prepare for possible future impacts</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3389/fmars.2015.00128</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210644</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Carbon Leakage: The Impact of Asymmetric Regulation on Carbon-Emitting Production</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Regions with carbon emission regulations bear the risk of â€œcarbon leakageâ€&#x9d; if local producers shift production capacity to an unregulated region. We investigate the problem for a producer subject to geographically asymmetric emission regulation with uncertain future emission price. The producer has two ex ante options to lower its compliance cost: investing in clean production technology in the regulated region and building production capacity in the unregulated region. The producer determines its production quantities ex post, after emission price uncertainty is resolved. We study two anti-leakage policies, Border Tax (BT) and Output-Based Allocation (OB), where the former adopts a â€œstickâ€&#x9d; approach that penalizes offshore production and the latter adopts a â€œcarrotâ€&#x9d; approach that grants free emission allowances for production in the regulated region. First, we show that the emission price uncertainty can exert opposing effects in the absence of an anti-leakage policy: When the expected emission price is low (high), a higher uncertainty aggravates (mitigates) carbon leakage. Second, through a comprehensive comparison, we highlight that while both BT and OB are able to reduce carbon leakage, BT has a stronger effect in both the regulated and unregulated regions in multiple dimensions, especially when the carbon leakage risk is high. Third, we find that a higher emission price uncertainty weakens the effect of both BT and OB. We therefore suggest that emission price uncertainty should be accounted for when formulating anti-leakage policies. Finally, we extend our analysis to a competitive case and find that the superiority of BT relative to OB is enhanced.

The NA-ECA limited fuel sulfur use in these vessels to below 1\% in 2012 and to below 0.1\% starting in 2015. This work uses ambient PM2.5 monitoring data from the U.S. IMPROVE network and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor modeling to assess the effectiveness of the NA-ECA at reducing ambient PM2.5 from highsulfur residual fuel oil (RFO) use. RFO combustion emissions of PM2.5 are known to have a fairly unique vanadium (V) and nickel (Ni) trace metal signature. To determine if IMPROVE sites were affected by residual fuel oil combustion, V and Ni data from 65 IMPROVE sites in coastal States of the U.S. were analyzed from 2010 to 2011, the two years prior to NA-ECA implementation. 22 of these IMPROVE sites had a V and Ni correlation coefficient (r(2)) greater than 0.65 and were selected for further analysis by PMF. The slopes of the correlations between V and Ni at these 22 sites ranged from 2.2 to 4.1, consistent with reported V:Ni emission ratios from RFO combustion. Each of the 22 IMPROVE sites was modeled independently with PMF, using the available PM2.5 chemical speciation data from 2010 to 2015. PMF model solutions for the 22 sites contained from 5 to 9 factors, depending on the site. At every site a PMF factor was identified that was associated with RFO combustion, however, 9 sites had PMF factors where RFO combustion was mixed with other aerosol sources. For the remaining 13 sites, PM2,5 from RFO combustion was analyzed for three time periods; 2010-2011 representing the time period prior to the NA-ECA implementation (pre-NA-ECA), 2013-2014 representing the time period where fuel sulfur was limited to 1.0\% (NA-ECA 1.0\% S), and 2015 representing the time period where fuel sulfur was limited to 0.1\% (NA-ECA 0.1\% S). All 13 sites indicated statistically significant reductions in the contribution of RFO combustion to PM2.5 between the pre-NA-ECA period and the two periods of fuel sulfur control. The average decrease in annual average PM2.5 from RFO combustion from the pre-NA-ECA to NA-ECA 1\% S period was 50.2\% (range, 29.0\%-65.4\%) and from the pre-NA-ECA to NA-ECA 0.1\% S period was 74.1\% (range, 33.0\%-90.4\%).

However, a comprehensive post-assessment on the policy's effectiveness is still lacking. This study developed a series of high-spatiotemporal ship emission inventories around China from 2016 to 2019 based on an updated Ship Emission Inventory Model (SEIM v2.0) and analyzed the interannual changes in emissions under the influence of both ship activity increases and gradually promoted policies. In this model, NOx, SO2, PM and HC emissions from ships in China's inland rivers and the 200 Nm (nautical miles) coastal zone were estimated every day with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees based on a combination of automatic identification system (AIS) data and the Ship Technical Specifications Database (STSD). The route restoration technology and classification of ocean-going vessels (OGVs), coastal vessels (CVs) and river vessels (RVs) has greatly improved our model in the spatial distribution of ship emissions. From 2016 to 2019, SO2 and PM emissions from ships decreased by 29.6 \% and 26.4 \%, respectively, while ship NOx emissions increased by 13.0 \%. Although the DECA 1.0 policy was implemented in 2017, it was not until 2019 when DECA 2.0 came into effect that a significant emission reduction was achieved, e.g., a year-on-year decrease of 33.3 \%, regarding SO2. Considering the potential emissions brought by the continuous growth of maritime trade, however, an even larger SO2 emission reduction effect of 39.8 \% was achieved in these 4 years compared with the scenario without switching to cleaner fuel. Containers and bulk carriers are still the dominant contributors to ship emissions, and newly built, large ships and ships using clean fuel oil account for an increasingly large proportion of emission structures. A total of 4 years of consecutive daily ship emissions were presented for major ports, which reflects the influence of the step-by-step DECA policy on emissions in a timely manner and may provide useful references for port observation experiments and local policy making. In addition, the spatial distribution shows that a number of ships detoured outside the scope of DECA 2.0 in 2019, perhaps to save costs on more expensive low-sulfur oil, which would increase emissions in farther maritime areas. The multiyear ship emission inventory provides high-quality datasets for air-quality and dispersion modeling, as well as verifications for in situ observation experiments, which may also guide further ship emission control directions in China.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.5194/acp-21-13835-2021</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210672</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Performance of a plate-wave energy converter integrated in a floating breakwater</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">A plate-wave energy converter (pWEC) moored in front of a floating stationary breakwater is considered. The pWEC is composed of a submerged flexible plate with piezoelectric layers bonded to both faces of it. Hence the elastic motion of the plate excited by water waves can be transformed into useful electricity due to the piezoelectric effect. To evaluate the performance of the breakwater-attached pWEC in terms of wave power absorption and wave attenuation, a hydroelastic model based on linear potential flow theory and the eigenfunction matching method is developed with the electromechanical and the hydrodynamic problems of the pWEC coupled together. The pWEC can be either simply supported or clamped at the edge. A multi-parameter analysis is carried out with the employment of the present model. Effects of the width, submergence and edge types of the plate, together with the scales of the breakwater, including its width and draft, on wave power absorption and wave attenuation, are examined. As the pWEC moves towards a deeper position, the main peaks of the frequency response of the wave power absorption efficiency become lower and narrower. In contrast, its effect on wave attenuation isÂ limited. Â© 2021 The Authors.

The basic concept of Hybrid propulsion is the use of battery packs to store energy and consequentially operate the propulsion system of the ship, in order to have zero emission navigation, especially in areas of environmental interest. Especially this propulsion is spreading in passenger ships, such as small passenger ferries or yacht, due to the importance of carrying people in a clean way. This propulsion makes extensive use of Li-Ion or Li-Po batteries, storing high quantities of energy, (MWh) to provide the propulsion, furthermore, the propulsion systems are usually operating with high voltage (660 V or more) to guarantee adequate efficiency at the system. As well know, the Lithium based batteries offer a good capability storing energy, but there is also a problem of risk of explosion in case of overheating. The author will investigate in the paper, the consequences of the hybrid propulsion in small ships, considering the case study of small passenger ships, examining the interaction among the industrial solutions adopted for the realization of the hybrid propulsion system{[}1] and the specific requirements of the marine rules in terms of changes to the project, to increase the safety of the ship, The paper will examine the aspects of fire protection not only from the point of view of the passive fireprotection but also from the point of view of the containment of problem of overheating, underlining the need of a smart and combined use of manufacturing solutions and remote control systems. The paper will show how the use of the hybrid propulsion is for sure interesting in terms of environment protection, but at the same time, it requires some important changes to the project approach that cannot be underestimated.

The site for the desalination plants should be selected carefully and should be away from residential areas particularly for forward planning for possible future expansions. The concerning issues identified are noise pollution, visual pollution, reduction in recreational fishing and swimming areas, emission of materials into the atmosphere, the brine discharge and types of disposal methods used are the main cause of pollution. The reverse osmosis (RO) method is the preferred option in modern times especially when fossil fuels are becoming expensive. The RO has other positives such as better efficiency (30-50%) when compared with distillation type plants (10-30%). However, the RO membranes are susceptible to fouling and scaling and as such they need to be cleaned with chemicals regularly that may be toxic to receiving waters. The input and output water in desalination plants have to be pre and post treated, respectively. This involves treating for pH, coagulants, Cl, Cu, organics, CO2, H2S and hypoxia. The by-product of the plant is mainly brine with concentration at times twice that of seawater. This discharge also includes traces of various chemicals used in cleaning including any anticorrosion products used in the plant and has to be treated to acceptable levels of each chemical before discharge but acceptable levels vary depending on receiving waters and state regulations. The discharge of the brine is usually done by a long pipe far into the sea or at the coastline. Either way the high density of the discharge reaches the bottom layers of receiving waters and may affect marine life particularly at the bottom layers or boundaries. The longer term effects of such discharge concentrate has not been documented but it is possible that small traces of toxic substances used in the cleaning of RO membranes may be harmful to marine life and ecosystem. The plants require saline water and thus the construction of input and discharge output piping is vital. The piping are often lengthy and underground as it is in Tugun (QLD, Australia), passing below the ground. Leakage of the concentrate via cracks in rocks to aquifers is a concern and therefore appropriate monitoring quality is needed. Leakage monitoring devices ought to be attached to such piping during installation. The initial environment impact assessment should identify key parameters for monitoring during discharge processes and should recommend ongoing monitoring with devices attached to structures installed during construction of plants.

It is shown that the voltage will rise by approximately 30% within 50-100 ms in the ensuing island operation. The process is superimposed by transients caused by short but repetitive periods of saturation of the transformer resulting in excitation of the resonance frequency between transformer and cable capacitance predominantly in the zero sequence. It is demonstrated that in EMT type simulation the phenomena can be reproduced provided that the wind turbine control and the saturation of the transformer are properly modelled. A simulation tool has been used to demonstrate the effect of the level of wind farm loading at the instant of islanding on the observed phenomena.

Climate change and ecological damage unparalleled in recent history echoed these milestones. Storms have become more erratic and extreme. The first plot of habitable land recently gave way to rising sea levels in coastal India. Deforestation, desertification, and sprawling development are drastically reducing the world's biological diversity and available arable land. Global warming is no longer under dispute. The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change links human behavior with higher land and ocean temperatures and rising sea levels over the past century and into the future (IPCC 2007). The greatest impetus for growing greener is thus the impending crises stemming from climate change. Human activities are responsible for many of these ecological problems. For example, in America's Appalachian region and other mining districts around the world, miners eliminated mountains, filled river valleys, and left gaping holes carved into the earth's crust to reach the underlying natural resources. The use of fossil fuels for transport and manufacturing concentrates pollution in the air, oceans, animals, and, most worrisome, in those who use them and their children. Just as humans have created these problems, they can also relieve them by promoting greener patterns of growth. Most important, they can reduce the demand for energy through promoting green regional design to achieve a greater balance between the built and natural environments, curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Intervention at the regional scale is not only feasible but also necessary to counteract the dangers of climate change. In this essay we define the key aspects of green regional design. We then use the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut metropolitan area as a case study of the application of regional design, detailing its use in the creation of open space, transportation (and related land uses) and energy networks that frame an area's growth and development. We show how it makes the area more livable and competitive while addressing global warming.

To substantiate this view, the present investigation was conducted in one of the units of sewage fed East Kolkata wetlands (EKW), a Ramsar site, over a period of 3years. The result revealed that because of high primary productivity due to abundance of primary producers and other sources of C input primarily through sewage influx, there is net positive balance of C in the system. The rate of C accumulation estimated through C budget was 1245.27-2490.55kg C ha(-1) year(-1) while the rate estimated through sediment core analysis came out to be 1584kg C ha(-1) year(-1). The amount of total C deposited up to 15cm depth in sediment was 29.37Mgha(-1), quite higher than the C deposited up to 15cm depth of reference upland soil which was measured at 23.79Mgha(-1). If C burial from this experiment in 55ha is up-scaled for entire EKW of 12,500ha area, then it empirically corresponds to 56.97-113.94 Gg CO2 captured from atmosphere per annum. EKW is not only used for aquaculture production thereby harvesting blue carbon but also has great potential to accumulate C in its sediments and thus helping mitigate climate change.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s11273-019-09661-8</style></electronic-resource-num></record></records></xml>
