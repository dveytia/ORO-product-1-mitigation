The global trend of e-mobility also applies to sea and inland water transport. This article presents the results of experimental tests carried out on a life-size, parallel diesel-electric hybrid propulsion system. The efficiency of the propulsion system was analysed for two modes of operation (electric and diesel) and for different engine speeds and loads. Analysis of the impact of using a hybrid propulsion system on fuel consumption was carried out on a case study vessel and for six actual journeys. The use of hybrid propulsion in zero emission mode enables up to four times higher energy efficiency when compared to a conventional drive, while reducing CO2 emissions and air pollution to zero, as well as a hundred-fold reduction in noise emissions. High flexibility in the operation of such a drive enables the use of intelligent power control technology (smart propulsion). This article shows that the use of hybrid propulsion reduces the negative impact on the environment to a minimum and allows for a significant reduction in the vessel's operating costs.

In this study, a new integrated, model-based design and optimization method for hybrid electric propulsion system of a marine vessel (harbor tugboat) has been introduced. The sizes of key hybrid powertrain components, especially the Li-ion battery energy storage system (ESS), which can greatly affect the ship's life-cycle cost (LCC), have been optimized using the fuel efficiency, emission and lifecycle cost model of the hybrid powertrain system. Moreover, the control strategies for the hybrid system, which is essential for achieving the minimum fuel consumption and extending battery life, are optimized. For a given powertrain architecture, the optimal design of a hybrid marine propulsion system involves two critical aspects: the optimal sizing of key powertrain components, and the optimal power control and energy management. In this work, a bi-level, nested optimization framework was proposed to address these two intricate problems jointly. The upper level optimization aims at component size optimization, while the lower level optimization carries out optimal operation control through dynamic programming (DP) to achieve the globally minimum fuel consumption and battery degradation for a given vessel load profile. The optimized Latin hypercube sampling (OLHS), Kriging and the widely used Expected Improvement (EI) online sampling criterion are used to carry out ``small data{''} driven global optimization to solve this nested optimization problem. The obtained results showed significant reduction of the vessel LCC with the optimized hybrid electric powertrain system design and controls. Reduced engine size and operation time, as well as improved operation efficiency of the hybrid system also greatly decreased the GHG emissions compared to traditional mechanical propulsion.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210109</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Reduction of Resistance, Fuel Consumption and GHG Emission of a Small Fishing Vessel by Adding a Bulbous Bow</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Protection of marine environment and reduction of GHG emissions are currently imperative criterion for ship design. For ships in service, including fishing vessels powered by internal combustion engines, options of retrofitting are sought to reduce their hydrodynamic resistance and fuel consumption. One such possibility is the addition of a simple-shape bulbous bow, which can be installed at low cost to upgrade a fishing vessel. We present an analysis of the effect that the bulbous bow has on fishing vessel resistance across the whole range of speeds at which the entire work cycle of the vessel is carried out. The resistance was calculated using a calculation of fluid dynamics (CFD) method for the actual size of the vessel. We show that it is possible to develop such a bulbous bow for which the resistance of fishing vessel with a bulbous bow is going to be lower than that of an unmodified shape. For the modified shape of the fishing vessel, fuel consumption, amount and composition of exhaust gases were calculated and the obtained results were compared with the parameters of the vessel without modification. The tests carried out and the obtained calculation results indicate that a significant reduction of fuel consumption and GHG emissions may be obtained for the existing old fishing vessels at low anticipated modernization costs.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/en14071837</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210110</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Maintaining marine diesel emissions using performance monitoring</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Ships are an integral part of modern commercial transport, leisure travel, and military system. A diesel engine was used for the first time for the propulsion of a ship sometime in the 1910s and has been the choice for propulsion and power generation, ever since. Since the first model used in ship propulsion, the diesel engine has come a long way with several technological advances. A diesel engine has a particularly high thermal efficiency. Added to it, the higher energy density of the diesel fuel compared to gasoline fuel makes it inherently, the most efficient internal combustion engine. The modern diesel engine also has a very unique ability to work with a variety of fuels like diesel, heavy fuel oil, biodiesel, vegetable oils, and several other crude oil distillates which is very important considering the shortage of petroleum fuels that we face today. In spite of being highly efficient and popular and in spite of all the technological advances, the issue of exhaust gas emissions has plagued a diesel engine. This issue has gained a lot of importance since 1990s when IMO, EU, and the EPA came up with the Tier I exhaust gas emission norms for the existing engine in order to reduce the NOx and SOx. Harsher Tier II and Tier III norms were later announced for newer engines. Diesel fuels commonly used in marine engines are a form of residual fuel, also know as Dregs or Heavy Fuel Oil and are essentially the by products of crude oil distillation process used to produce lighter petroleum fuels like marine distillate fuel and gasoline. They are cheaper than marine distillate fuels but are also high in nitrogen, sulfur and ash content. This greatly increases the NOx and SOx in the exhaust gas emission. Ship owners are trapped between the need to use residual fuels, due to cost of the large volume of fuel consumed, in order to keep the operation of their ships to a competitive level on one hand and on the other hand the need to satisfy the stringent pollution norms as established by the pollution control agencies worldwide. Newer marine diesel engines are being designed to meet the Tier II and Tier III norms wherever applicable but the existing diesel engine owners are still operating their engines with the danger of not meeting the applicable pollution norms worldwide. Here we make an effort to look at some of the measure that the existing marine diesel engine owners can take to reduce emissions and achieve at least levels prescribed in Tier I. Proper maintenance and upkeep of the engine components can be effectively used to reduce the exhaust gas emission. We introduced a pilot program on diesel engine performance monitoring in North America about two years ago and it has yielded quite satisfying results for several shipping companies and more and more ship owners are looking at the option of implementing this program on their ships.

Historically, fuel costs have been low compared to fixed and other variable costs, but more recently, rising fuel prices and environmental concerns have made it more attractive to reduce fuel consumption through lower steaming speeds. Since speed reduction drastically reduces power requirements, it has become common to operate at 15 to 50% of the installed power in calm to moderate sea conditions. When engines operate at low power, fuel consumption per kWh produced power increases slightly, while the emissions of exhaust gases increase rapidly due to incomplete combustion. This study investigates flexible hybrid power solutions, i.e. power take out (PTO), power take in (PTI) and batteries in combination with internal combustion engines. The focus is on the full operational range from being idle at berth to the peak power needed in critical situations in high sea states. Our results indicate that hybrid solutions are cost-competitive with traditional engine setups. They also reduce the environmental impact, including greenhouse gas emissions and cost effectively satisfies IMOâ€™s energy efficiency requirements (EEDI).

This, in combination with the rather stringent regulations, which are continuously being adopted, have resulted in the development of innovative and energy efficient technologies aiming at mitigating shipping's impact on the environment. This design project proposes an energy efficient solution aiming at the reduction of air emissions generated by the fleet of one of the largest sections of international shipping, containerships. By designing a containerised battery system capable of providing 10.3MWh of useful energy, the ultimate aim is to replace an existing diesel generator and to operate the battery system on manoeuvring. With the aid of a load planner software it was ensured that such a system can be loaded on-board a specific containership, without a negative impact on the stability and the structural integrity of the employed vessel. The battery system can be charged both by a shore supply (cold ironing) as well as during the seagoing part of the voyage. The energy feasibility of such a system and the emissions reduction were verified by developing several software models, which allowed various case study trips to be investigated. Results from the case studies suggested that with such a system on-board, emissions can be reduced by 19% when the ship carries only normal containers and by 4 % when the ship carries normal and refrigerated containers. However, the performed financial analysis indicated that such an investment would result to a loss, primarily due to the current price of battery systems.

One of the main objectives is to search the alternative to fossil fuels. The main problem is the lack of indication of the target fuel for shipping. The current changes, forced by international regulations, are made by the decisions of shipowners who themselves are looking for an alternative fuel that will enable them to continue their activities. Attempts have been made to use fuels considered as transient, which will be used in the perspective of about 10 years. However, this is too short a time compared to the life of the ship (20â€“30 years). This will force another change in the type of fuel used on ships still in operation, which will result in additional costs associated with the adaptation of the shipâ€™s power plant fuel systems to a different type of fuel. The article evaluates the changes that currently taking place. Scenarios of the most likely directions of changes in a perspective of 2050 have been indicated. Â© 2022, Politechnika Lubelska.

Therefore, effective energy consumption monitoring and emission control methods in the process of ship operation have attracted great attention in related fields. Therefore, this study optimized the structure of the energy consumption monitoring equipment for hybrid ships, and achieved the energy consumption monitoring and control by effectively collecting the energy consumption data of hybrid ships. The application of real-time monitoring system for ship energy consumption can better monitor the energy consumption of hybrid ships and realize the treatment and control of energy conservation and emission reduction according to the monitoring results. At the same time, according to the current situation of ship energy consumption management, through the analysis of the characteristics of ship operation and diesel engine fuel system, this study proposed a low loss, high precision mass flowmeter, to achieve the requirements of energy conservation and emission reduction control. Based on this, strengthening ship basic management, saving Marine fuel and reducing pollution can achieve a win-win situation between economy and environment.

However, it is challenging to develop optimal or near-optimal energy management for these systems without exact knowledge of future load profiles. Although efforts have been made to develop strategies in a stochastic environment with discrete state space using Q-learning and Double Q-learning, such tabular reinforcement learning agents' effectiveness is limited due to the state space resolution. This article aims to develop an improved energy management system using deep reinforcement learning to achieve enhanced cost-saving by extending discrete state parameters to be continuous. The improved energy management system is based upon the Double Deep Q-Network. Real-world collected stochastic load profiles are applied to train the Double Deep Q-Network for a coastal ferry. The results suggest that the Double Deep Q-Network acquired energy management strategy has achieved a further 5.5\% cost reduction with a 93.8\% decrease in training time, compared to that produced by the Double Q-learning agent in discrete state space without function approximations. In addition, this article also proposes an adaptive deep reinforcement learning energy management scheme for practical hybrid-electric propulsion systems operating in changing environments.

For instance, starting in 2020 the International Maritime Organization (IMO) required a reduction of the global sulfur limit for shipping fuels outside designated Sulfur Emission Control Areas (SECA) from 3.5% to 0.5% on a mass basis. Other pollutants are also being targeted for short-term and long-term reduction. Aiming at providing sustainable fuel solutions for the stage of tank to propeller, this manuscript evaluates various shipping fuel options focusing on quantitatively comparing the fuel consumption and emissions of major air pollutants. A bottom-up emission inventory model is developed by analyzing and optimizing multiple sources of load factors, specific fuel consumption and emission factors. Rather than taking deterministic emission leading values, this work improves the model quality by considering external factors and the latest emission data and processing a detailed ship-by-ship calculation for the ship database collected by the shipboard Automatic Identification System (AIS). The amounts of carbon dioxide for the main engine, auxiliary engine and auxiliary boilier are firstly calculated, and then the fuel consumption per nautical mile are computed by integrating CO2 intensity. Next, ship exhaust gases are calculated for two categories: (i) gases impacting the global warming potential (GWP) and (ii) the non-GWP gases. Besides sustainable solutions within one specific ship fleet, this work firstly establishes a nautical mile-based fuel consumption per unit of capacity bin for major merchant ships to serve as a basis for finding an optimized fuel solution among different ship types. In addition to addressing the typical ship-source pollutants, this work also focuses on negative environmental effects resulting from BCA because it has not been thoroughly considered in the literatures despite its contribution to GWP. To illustrate the value and applicability of the proposed approach, a case study is solved to estimate the cumulative fuel consumption and GWP-related gas emission inventory for a transoceanic trip from Houston to Rotterdam. The results demonstrate that the GWP gas emissions of heavy fuel oil with scrubber are 38% more than those of one LNG dual-engine option. Explicit consideration is also given to BCA emissions. The results indicate that the blended fuel aimed at satisfying the IMO 2020 Sulfur Cap does not perform well in BCA emission control.

In developing such devices, it is crucial to understand their hydrodynamic characteristics and to consider their corresponding effects accurately on the powering performance of a ship when applied. In this study, a number of model tests for several large container vessels were performed to investigate effects of a "rudder bulb" on the powering performance. From these investigations, a modified extrapolation method of full scale wake fraction is proposed which can be reflected into the practical evaluation of the rudder bulb acting on the full scale wake field. In near future, the proposed method will be verified by comparing the powering performance of full scale sea trials with that of model tests.

Due to the presence of non-linearity in Specific FC (SFC) curves of the diesel engines, the PSO algorithm is used. The SFC-vs-load relationship obtained from Brake SFC (BSFC) map of the diesel engines is characterized using a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) interpolation.

The majority of ships designed for international voyages and powered by large two-stroke marine diesel engines use heavy fuel oil (HFO), which has the advantage of a low price compared to other types of fuel. However, HFO generates large amounts of harmful exhaust emissions during combustion in a marine diesel engine. In addition, as fuel costs account for a large portion of the expenditure budgets of the shipping companies that operate and manage such ships, fuel cost reduction is of considerable interest to such companies. In this study, two fuel additives, oil-soluble Ca-based and oil-soluble Fe-based organometallic compounds, which can improve the performance of diesel engines, were injected into HFO at fixed concentrations (1/4000 and 1/6000 of the total fuel, respectively), in attempts to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. For enhanced experimental accuracy and reproducibility, a large two-stroke diesel engine installed in a land-based power plant was used as the test subject. Evaluative tests were conducted for three engine loads (50\%, 75\%, and 100\%). The engine performance (i.e., the fuel consumption rate, maximum combustion pressure, and exhaust gas temperature) and the exhaust emissions (NOx, particulate matter (PM)) were analyzed before and after the fuel additive insertion.

Predominantly, a hybrid power system is used via a combination of alternative energy sources with hydrocarbon fuel due to the relatively small energy efficiency of the former as compared to the latter. For such a hybrid system to operate efficiently, the power management on the multiple power sources has to be optimised and the power requirements for different vessel types with varying loading operation profiles have to be understood. This can be achieved by using energy management systems (EMS) or power management systems (PMS) and control methods for hybrid marine power systems. This review paper focuses on the different EMSs and control strategies adopted to optimise power management as well as reduce fuel consumption and thus the carbon emission for hybrid vessel systems. This paper first presents the different commonly used hybrid propulsion systems, i.e., dieselâ€“mechanical, dieselâ€“electric, fully electric and other hybrid systems.

International maritime organization (IMO) has prescribed operational and design measures to develop energy efficiency and decrease ship emissions, and one of the effective operational measures is trim optimization, which is a feasible measure because it does not necessitate ship structural modification or engine advancement, but it can reduce the ship resistance and decrease fuel consumption. The study of trim optimization can be implemented by conducting experimental tests, but it is a difficult, expensive method and consumed more time. Therefore, the present paper proposes a numerical method to predict the optimum trim which achieves the minimum ship resistance and lower fuel consumption. The current paper investigated two types of ships as a case study, bulk carrier, and container ship. The optimization process has studied several trim conditions, ship drafts, and speeds. The results showed that positive trim (trim by bow) have an increasing effect on fuel consumption, while the negative trim (trim by stern) have a decreasing effect on fuel consumption. Fuel-saving based on using optimum trim at each speed is a significant quantity to be benefited as it would reduce the operating costs and increase the energy efficiency.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s11356-022-22116-7</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210171</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Low emission LNG fuelled ships for environmental friendly operations in arctic areas</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Environmental restrictions now favor cleaner fuels, and Natural gas (LNG) is one of the most promising alternative fuels. Highly efficient natural gas fuelled engines have been developed since around 1990. These engines are now entering maritime applications, offering significant emission reductions, both in a local and global perspective. Using LNG as fuel reduce NOx emissions by up to 90%, SOx and particulate matter (soot) are reduced by 95-100% and CO 2 emissions are reduced by up to 25%, when compared to traditional marine fuels. These emission reductions are significant contribution especially in local and regional environments. Using LNG as a clean fuel also offers a significant increase in total energy efficiency. Combining power and heat generation, natural gas fuelled engines for on-shore power generation offer a total thermal efficiency of 80-90%, depending on the waste heat recovery rate. For liquid fuels exhaust heat recovery is limited due to the sulfur content, which may cause acid corrosion. Onboard ships, LNG fuelled engines have potential to utilize waste heat to obtain significant higher thermal efficiency than their diesel engine counterpart. LNG is mainly available from fossil sources, but now also increasingly from renewable sources as bio-gas. For storing and transportation LNG is preferred as less challenging compared to high pressure CNG. On the coast of Norway a LNG distribution system is now being built, supplying a fleet of more than 40 ships. LNG is transported by special designed small LNG carriers from the production plants to a series of main terminals along the coastline. From these main terminals the LNG is distributed by trucks to the local fuelling stations, or for direct fuelling of the ships. This paper will present the basic technology and experiences from this full scale LNG fuel system. The paper will discuss local and global environmental benefits, technical solutions, safety issues, and costs issues related to the distribution system and the on-board fuel installations.

One of the most effective strategies for reducing GHG emissions is to switch from conventional fuels such as heavy fuel oil to alternative fuels. Green hydrogen is a promising alternative for the shipping industry. Nonetheless, its potential usage will depend on more than its environmental friendliness. Economic, technical, and safety factors must be assessed. This paper provides a critical assessment of the potential usage of green hydrogen in the shipping industry with an evaluation of production routes, techno-economic performance, storage, and safety. Benchmarking is also carried out compared to existing â€˜greyâ€™ and â€˜blueâ€™ production routes specific to shipping industry applications. Important metrics for liquid hydrogen are analyzed to evaluate production cost and GHG emissions for various routes. Furthermore, a comparison is made for the safety and health issues of hydrogen compared to conventional and emerging maritime shipping fuels.

The OWTIS concept has major advantages over existing assets, not least in its ability to improve offshore safety by necessitating fewer tasks to be performed offshore. It is environmentally friendly and able to operate in harsh weather and deploy large loads. The OWTIS concept is not limited by water depth and is readily transferable to the oil and gas heavy-lift market. The purpose-designed OWTIS will be equipped with a unique 1500-ton crane which, when used in conjunction with the patented lift system, will enable fully assembled wind turbines to be installed in one lift onto pre-installed foundations. This new industry-changing vessel will reduce the cost of installing offshore wind turbines by at least one third compared to current methods. IHC Merwede and W3GM expect that OWTIS will be the first of a series of vessels to enable the burgeoning offshore wind industry to meet the economic targets for round three of offshore wind farm development in the UK and other similar projects in Europe.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210195</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Control Strategy for Battery/Flywheel Hybrid Energy Storage in Electric Shipboard Microgrids</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Integrated power system combines electrical power for both ship service and electric propulsion loads by forming a microgrid.

In this paper, HyForce, the next generation 2 MW hydrogen powered virtual tugboat was designed for a feasibility assessment for her techno-economic and environmental footprint to replace existing diesel-powered tugboats. The study compares the use of hydrogen fuel cells and an internal combustion engine to perform the same dynamic load profile for a typical tugboat mission. The results from the study show that a signpost for commercial competitiveness of HyForce is influenced primarily by the projected liquid hydrogen cost of 5.10 USD per kg in 2040 with a 2,000 USD/kW capital cost for the fuel cells.

To simulate this hybrid electric power system, a nonlinear programming method is used to identify the optimal power sharing criteria between generators and the energy storage. The control strategy is based on the diesel generators loading level, which is implemented in MATLABÂ®. A comparison is made by counter posing the simulation results of the ship power system, before and after using the energy storage.

It is, therefore, necessary to identify the areas where improvements can be made to reduce fuel consumption, and influence to the shipowners, shipyards and designers of ships on the need to implement these improvements in energetic efficiency and to achieve a reduction of between 25% and 75% of CO2 emissions as IMO report 2009 provides, making ships even more environmentally friendly. The study was conducted focusing on one type of ship such as containership, compiling a database of these ships built from 2000 to 2014. The 3618 ships comprising the study were taken from the database of Lloyd's Register of Shipping. With all the technical data on each of the ships, we proceeded to relate the main and auxiliary power, with the operating speed of the vessel, its displacement and GT, by size, age and generation ships. All the above comparisons were made according to ship sizes, graphically and analytically in which interesting conclusions could be drawn in the relevant dimensioning of the main and auxiliary engines, as well as the operation of the ship. Because of the current crisis some owners have already begun to change their size criteria of propulsion and auxiliary engines of these vessels, their management and operation as well as their speed. Another significant finding was the identification of some shipyards that build their ships with an oversize and exaggerated power of the main and auxiliary engines, regardless of the effect on increasing fuel consumption and impact on the environment. Finally, we have performed a comparative study of EEOI of these vessels by size and age to determine the environmental signature and their evolution. All this leads us to determine a set of measures to be applied, for example, power reduction or derating, etc. on existing ships and applied to new designs, thus reducing the propulsion and auxiliary power of these ships and collaborating to reduce greenhouse gases.

If the shipping industry aims at delivering its proportionate contribution to curbing global warming under the Paris agreement, the sector has to, inevitably, promote energy conservation and emission reduction. A rapidly growing oceangoing fleet size and correspondingly rising GHG emissions on a global scale raise an interesting research question: could a certain relationship between the two be characterized as a function so that further emissions can be forecast based on the model? The paper adopts an allometric approach based on biological scaling laws to explore the potential relationship between the fleet size and corresponding GHG emissions from shipping. The results show that both the slowdown of the navigation speed and the current implementation of the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Energy Efficiency Operation Index (EEOI) are effective on the whole. By employing the model, the development trends of GHG emissions from shipping in the future can be better understood. Through model applications and result analysis, numerical results validate the effectiveness of this method. The paper not only studies the development of GHG emissions from shipping in the past, but aslo evaluates its specific emission quantities in the future which is in line with the GHG emission reduction targets proposed by IMO on the 72nd IMO meeting, which will be helpful for policy decisions on the quota of GHG emissions to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and port administrators.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.03.136</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210216</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Preliminary thermodynamic analysis of waste heat recovery in marine diesel engines using Organic Rankine Cycles</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">In order to comply with International Maritime Organization (IMO) gas emissions legislations and to cut fuel costs, ship owners are considering different options both in terms of utilization of different fuels and of introduction of energy recovery solutions.

Among these, Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) using Organic Rankine Cycles (ORC) is receiving growing attention in particular, to recover low temperature waste heat in 2-stroke diesel engines. In order to assess the potential of the ORC utilization in terms of fuel saving, in this work, a preliminary thermodynamic analysis is presented. The analysis is based on a thermodynamic process simulation model of an ORC applied to a 2-stroke diesel engine implemented using Engineering Equation Solver (EES). The simulation model allows to analyse different type of engines and different waste heat recovery layouts. In this work, strategies for heat recovery in the cooling water circuits have been compared and different working fluids considered. Overall, the analysis allowed to identify the best waste heat recovery plat configuration both in terms of layout and working fluid. The preliminary thermodynamic analysis shows that recovering heat from the high temperature cooling water circuit allows a potential reduction in fuel consumption of 0.9-1%.

Therefore, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) implemented an amendment to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annex VI, which stipulates that the sulfur content in marine fuel oil shall not exceed 0.5 wt.% starting in 2020. In order to meet the IMO low sulfur policy, shipping lines could adopt one of the following strategies: (1) using very low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO), i.e., with sulfur content less than 0.5 wt.%; (2) installing scrubbers or other exhaust gas aftertreatment systems; or (3) replacing current fuels with clean alternative fuels such as natural gas. This study evaluates the feasibility and benefits of these strategies for shipping lines in order to determine the most cost-effective measures. First, according to the feasibility of the strategies evaluated by SWOT analysis, although scrubbers can reduce emissions of sulfur oxides into the atmosphere, more and more countries are restricting the discharge of wastewater from open-loop scrubbers into their waters. Instead, VLSFO and liquefied natural gas (LNG) are good choices in terms of environmental protection and economic benefits. Therefore, this study further evaluates the two strategies of replacing high sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) with VLSFO and converting diesel engines to LNG engines based on a cost-benefit methodology. This study took an 8500 TEU container vessel, which is powered by a marine diesel engine with the nominal power of 61,800 kW, sailing the Asian-European route as an example, and calculated the total incremental costs, pollutant emission reductions, and cost benefits arising from the implementation of the VLSFO and LNG strategies, respectively. According to the results of this study, the total incremental cost of LNG is higher than that of VLSFO in the first 4.7 years, but this gradually decreases, making the gap of the total incremental costs between the two strategies wider year by year. In comparison with using HSFO without any improvement, the total incremental costs of the VLSFO and LNG strategies increase by 12.94% and 22.16% over the following five years, respectively. The use of LNG can significantly reduce SOx, PM, NOx, and CO2 emissions; on the other hand, it leads to more CH4 emissions than the VLSFO strategy. Compared to doing nothing, the cumulative reduction rates of SOx, PM, NOx, and CO2 emissions over the next five years after the adoption of the LNG strategy are 3.6%, 7.0%, 70.4%, and 15.7%, respectively. The higher emission reduction rates of LNG compared to VLSFO illustrate that the former has a good effect on the suppression of exhaust gas pollution. In terms of the cost-benefit evaluation of the two strategies, this study shows that the VLSFO strategy is more cost-effective than the LNG strategy in the first 2.5 years, but that the cost-benefit ratio of the latter increases year by year and exceeds that of the former, and the gap between them widens year by year. Based on the evaluation results of this study, the LNG strategy is suitable for ocean-going container vessels with fixed routes and younger or larger sized vessels to meet the IMO low sulfur policy. In contrast, the VLSFO strategy is appropriate for old merchant ships with fewer container spaces. LNG is a suitable medium-and long-term strategy, i.e., for more than 2.5 years, for shipping lines to meet the IMO low sulfur policy, while VLSFO is a suitable short-term strategy.

The international efforts for maintaining a clean environment are various and this paper refers to the efforts in the maritime transport field. The subject of our study is the concept of Energy Efficiency Operational Index (EEOI), developed to provide ship-owners with assistance in the process of establishing the emissions from ships in operation, and to suggest the methods for achieving their reduction. As a monitoring tool, EEOI represents the mass of CO2 emitted per unit of transport work. Using the software developed by the authors, it will emphasize the variation of the EEOI value for one vessel using different types of fuel during the laden and ballast voyages, for a period of three months, as stated in the Ship's Log Books.

The outcomes to date are three policies; the " Energy Efficiency Design Index " (EEDI), the " Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan" (SEEMP) and the " Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator" (EEOI). The first two of these were included in MARPOL Annex VI Chapter 4 in July 2011 at MEPC 62 and apply to certain types of commercial ships. Although warships are exempt from IMO regulations, many navies throughout the world strive to meet IMO environmental regulations. As most navies are a reflection of their governments" policy, environmental stewardship is generally held as a high priority for navies during peacetime operations. This paper explores if and how the EEDI and SEEMP can be applied to warships.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210252</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">A variable DC approach to minimize drivetrain losses in fuel cell marine power systems</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">This paper presents a method of operating a zero-emission power system in marine vessels. The main goal of the proposed method is to reduce losses of drivetrain devices. The power sources considered in this work are proton exchange membrane fuel cell and lithium-ion battery while the main power consumers are induction motors driven propulsion system. Both sources and consumers are connected to a common DC bus through power conversion devices. In the proposed method, the DC bus voltage level is controlled according to the loading of the fuel cells. By controlling the DC bus voltage, it allows operation of fuel cell DC/DC converter in freewheeling mode which significantly reduces the converter losses. In addition, this approach is also expected to reduce the motor and battery drive losses. Feasibility of the proposed operation method and loss calculations are presented on a real-time hardware-in-loop simulator consisting of real control units and virtual power device models.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210253</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The Impact of Alternative Fuels on Ship Engine Emissions and Aftertreatment Systems: A Review</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Marine engines often use diesel as an alternative fuel to improve the economy. In recent years, waste oil, biodiesel and alcohol fuel are the most famous research directions among the alternative fuels for diesel. With the rapid development of the shipping industry, the air of coastal areas is becoming increasingly polluted. It is now necessary to reduce the emission of marine engines to meet the strict emission regulations. There are many types of alternative fuels for diesel oil and the difference of the fuel may interfere with the engine emissions; however, PM, HC, CO and other emissions will have a negative impact on SCR catalyst. This paper reviews the alternative fuels such as alcohols, waste oils, biodiesel made from vegetable oil and animal oil, and then summarizes and analyzes the influence of different alternative fuels on engine emissions and pollutant formation mechanism. In addition, this paper also summarizes the methods that can effectively reduce the emissions of marine engines; it can provide a reference for the study of diesel alternative fuel and the reduction of marine engine emissions.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/catal12020138</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210256</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Advancing propulsion efficiency</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">A discussion on efforts to codify measures for more efficient marine propulsion covers IMO's 2009-issued Ship Energy Efficiency Management Program (SEEMP) guidelines, which aim to reduce fuel consumption rates, which in turn, reduces CO2 emissions; planning on a vessel by vessel basis, including management improvements on the company level; new breed of electronic controlled engines, which can provide efficiency gains; realizing optimum firing pressure with reductions in fuel consumption rates per unit of power produced; features of MAN Diesel's ME engine, which optimizes peak firing pressure at all load ranges thereby reducing CO2; WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤'s RT-flex series that use a common rail system to allow complete control of fuel injection timing, rate of fuel flow, fuel pressure, and timing of valve operation; and overcoming issues with marine fuel treatment additives, e.g., PRI's fuel treatment chemistry for distillate fuels.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210257</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Reducing shipboard emissions â€“ Assessment of the role of electrical technologies</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Saving fuel and reducing emissions are major drivers in the marine industry, with a large number of potential modifications and machinery options available to enable the greening of shipping. Assessing which technology and what combination of solutions gives favourable economic results needs careful consideration of the vessel's operational profile. Electrification of shipboard systems introduces operational flexibility, offering the potential for fuel savings and emission reductions. Auxiliary drives, energy storage and onshore power supply are three approaches which address the issues of ship fuel consumption/emissions, specifically during in-harbour operation of vessels. In this paper, the impact of these three technologies on ship environmental performance and energy consumption is assessed by considering a real case RoRo vessel sailing a real operational profile. Models of the resultant system are built such that the machinery configurations can be analysed separately or in conjunction with each other. The results stress the importance of the operational profile of the vessel, showing significant fuel and emissions reductions during in-harbour operations but relatively small savings when considering operation through a complete return voyage. The sensitivity of the results to fuel and utility costs are also considered and shown to have a large impact on the economic feasibility (or otherwise) of different solutions.

The shipping industry underwent a tremendous growth during the last century (from 2.6 billion tons annual shipments in 1970 to 9.2 billion tons annual shipments in 2012). The industrial revolution and unrestricted transcontinental trade have catalyzed the global trade volume. Nowadays; merchant ships, approximately 50,000 in number, are sailing across the globe to deliver cargoes of various kinds. On the other hand, the shipping industry is also responsible for a notable amount of total CO2 emissions and several other harmful air pollutants such as Sulfur Oxides, Nitrogen Oxides and Particulate Matter. It may, however, be noted that shipping continues to remain a better environmental option for commercial transportation compared to other available means due to lowest gCO2/ton.km emissions. There is indeed an unrelenting requirement for further improvements in energy efficiency and emissions reduction in the shipping industry as global shipping volume is predicted to continue growing significantly in future. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has been vigorously seeking for new measures for further improvements in energy efficiency and emissions reduction, and swift implementation of these measures to reduce the harmful emissions from international shipping. A major improvement in fuel efficiency and significant reductions in harmful emissions from ships has been achieved over the past decades through improved powering technologies and increasing energy-efficiency of engine and propulsion systems. These technologies can be divided into three major groups, i.e., machinery options, propeller efficiency options and alternate powering options. In this chapter; a comprehensive overview of these green ship technologies is presented which includes basic concepts, principles and potential, related core issues and possible solutions.

Traditional ship energy efficiency monitoring is based on the noon reports, which are susceptible to human error and have a time delay. Many ship energy efficiency monitoring systems have been designed and developed, but they usually cannot send data to the shore in time. In order to identify abnormal fuel consumption in time, this paper realizes a big data collection system for ship energy efficiency monitoring based on the BeiDou System. The system installed on two sister container ships has already collected a lot of data. Big data analysis methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis, are applied in the system to realize data visualization and analysis. Using PCA, it turns out that the shaft power of the main engine is related to a certain ship speed, which is also affected by load and weather conditions, and is the biggest factor in determining fuel consumption. To realize the assessment of hull fouling and the optimization of ship trim, a useful physics-based analysis is proposed. The analysis shows that the fouling of ship body greatly increases its resistance. Our analysis method can also find the best trim under specific loading condition. All these points are important for reducing fuel consumption and improving ship efficiency.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1155/2021/9914720</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210272</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Bunkering &amp; fuel testing: Fuel for thought</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Even though shipping is one of the most efficient methods of transport in terms of carbon produced per ton-mile, it is the target of major carbon reduction efforts.

This is an electric generation system used to recover the waste heat of the exhaust gas from a diesel engine used for the propulsion of a large ship. As a result, when the boundary temperature between the topping and the bottoming cycles increased, the system efficiencies of energy and exergy were simultaneously maximized because the total exergy destruction rate (Â£Ed) and exergy loss (Â£) decreased, respectively. In the case of a marine diesel engine, the waste heat recovery electric generation system can be utilized for additional propulsion power, and the propulsion efficiency was found to be improved by an average of 9.17 % according to the engine load variation, as compared to the case with only the base engine.

The optimization of a ship's energy efficiency can reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions effectively. However, most of the available studies only focus on either the sailing speed or route optimization, and the interaction between speed and route under the influence of multiple environmental factors was not accounted properly. In this paper, a novel joint optimization method of the sailing route and speed, which considers the interaction between route and speed as well as multiple environmental factors, is proposed to fully exploit the energy efficiency's potential. Moreover, a joint optimization model of the sailing route and speed, which is based on an energy consumption model that considers multiple environmental factors, is established. Next, a solution algorithm for the joint optimization model is investigated in order to achieve joint decision-making with regard to the sailing route and speed. Finally, a case study is conducted that demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can achieve the optimal sailing route and speed under complex environmental conditions, as well as a reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of about 4\%.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.oceaneng.2020.107591</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210281</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Total life cycle emissions of post-Panamax containerships powered by conventional fuel or natural gas</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">This study proposes an easy-to-apply method, the Total Life Cycle Emission Model (TLCEM), to calculate the total emissions from shipping and help ship management groups assess the impact on emissions caused by their capital investment or operation decisions. Using TLCEM, we present the total emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs) during the 25-yr life cycle of 10 post-Panamax containerships under slow steaming conditions. The life cycle consists of steel production, shipbuilding, crude oil extraction and transportation, fuel refining, bunkering, and ship operation. We calculate total emissions from containerships and compare the effect of emission reduction by using various fuels. The results can be used to differentiate the emissions from various processes and to assess the effectiveness of various reduction approaches. Critical pollutants and GHGs emitted from each process are calculated. If the containerships use heavy fuel oil (HFO), emissions of CO2 total 2.79 million tonnes (Mt), accounting for 95.37\% of total emissions, followed by NOx and SOx emissions,which account for 2.25\% and 1.30\%, respectively.The most significant emissions are from the operation of the ship and originate from the main engine (ME).When fuel is switched to 100\% natural gas (NG), SOx, PM10, and CO2 emissions show remarkable reductions of 98.60\%, 99.06\%, and 21.70\%, respectively. Determining the emission factor of each process is critical for estimating the total emissions. The estimated emission factors were compared with the values adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO).The proposed TLCEM may contribute to more accurate estimates of total life cycle emissions from global shipping.Implications: We propose a total life cycle emissions model for 10 post-Panamax container ships. Using heavy fuel oil, emissions of CO2 total 2.79 Mt, accounting for approximately 95\% of emissions, followed by NOx and SOx emissions. Using 100\% natural gas, SOx, PM10, and CO2 emissions reduce by 98.6\%, 99.1\%, and 21.7\%, respectively. NOx emissions increase by 1.14\% when running a dual fuel engine at low load in natural gas mode.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1080/10962247.2018.1505675</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210286</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Energy efficiency and fuel changes to reduce environmental impacts</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Many different emissions from ships are directly related to a ship's fuel consumption. This is particularly true for emissions to air, which are generated during the combustion process in the engines. Hence, improving the conversion process from fuel energy to transport work can be an effective means of reducing ship emissions. Solutions for reducing ship fuel consumption are generally divided into design and operational measures. Design measures primarily include technical solutions implemented when the ship is designed, constructed, and retrofitted, such as weightreduction, hull coatings, air lubrication, improvement of hull design, optimal propulsion systems and harvesting waste energy. Operational measures are related to how the ship or the fleet is operated and include measures such as weather routing, optimal ship scheduling, improved ship logistics, and on-board energy management. Although reducing fuel consumption always generates an environmental benefit, it should be noted that the use of different fuels results in different impacts on the environment for a given energy conversion efficiency. Another way to reduce emissions is therefore related to the type of fuel used on a ship, e.g., diesel fuels, gases, alcohols and solid fuels. However, choosing a fuel is not an easy process because it is influenced by a broad range of criteria, including technical, environmental and economic criteria.

With this scenario in mind, the objective of this study was to develop a procedure to evaluate the potential benefits arising from the integration of innovative light-weight structures in ship hull structural design. To achieve such an objective, a hybrid light-weight ship hull structural design solution, in which aluminium honeycomb sandwich panels were used to build the conventional steel inner side shell of the cargo holds, was adopted for a bulk carrier. The authors of this study used a multiple criteria decision-making approach. An optimal ship hull structural design solution was identified based on capital cost, voyage cost, annual cost, energy efficiency design index, dismantlingâ€“reselling cost, cargo transportation, energy consumption and carbon footprint. The optimal solution, identified with the multiple criteria decision-making approach, improved the shipâ€™s efficiency and costs by combining the hybrid structural design with efficient cargo transportation. In addition, using recycled aluminium was found to be a promising strategy to reduce the energy consumption and carbon footprint related to the shipbuilding process.

Also, an exergy analysis is implemented to predict the irreversibility rates of the components of both HT and LT loops of the ORC system. Various organic fluids are examined for the HT and the LT ORC loops and the optimum combination is selected based on the results of a parametric analysis. The effect of ambient conditions on the energetic and exergetic performance of the dual-loop ORC is examined. The energy analysis of the bottoming dual-loop ORC is projected to a specific mission operational profile of a bulk carrier for predicting the benefits in fuel cost saving and CO2 and SO2 emission reduction compared to conventional vessel operation.

In this context, a hybrid medium voltage DC (MVDC) distribution system concept with diesel engine, PV system, and battery energy storage system (BESS) as the generators for the shipboard power system is proposed. Variable speed operation of a diesel engine is considered for the benefit of minimal specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC). Regarding the fault-tolerant characteristics of six-phase permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM), it is used for both generating and motoring application, thus maintaining system reliability at any time. A hierarchical control system is designed and implemented to ensure proper load power-sharing among the generators and to regulate the dc-link voltage of the proposed MVDC distribution system. To bolster the intent of minimal SFOC zone operation of diesel engines and coordination between the generators and load, a deterministic rule-based power management system is proposed and implemented. The simulation is carried out for potential operational modes of a cruise ship in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. Simulation results show that the proposed topological and control structure has satisfactory performance in terms of power delivery, stable dc-link dynamics, and overall system stability.

The strategy optimally balances the charge/discharge of the storage device, the power of the generation system, the loads' demand of hotels, auxiliaries, and electrical machineries used for propulsion and maneuvering purposes. The optimal approach aims at minimizing the fuel consumption, while technical constraints of the on-board system are considered in terms of both generation system and energy storage system.

However, the fuel cell of the hybrid power system has a critical drawback of short lifetime. For this reason, the development of the energy management strategy considering power sources degradation becomes significant and urgent. In addition, the power system configuration has a strong link with the control strategy. In this vein, a sizing method of the hybrid energy storage system for a fuel cell hybrid excursion ferry is proposed to prolong the fuel cell lifetime. Based on the configuration of the power system, a real-time optimization control strategy considering efficiency and durability is developed. To verify the control strategy, the mathematical model of the hybrid power system is established. Compared with the wavelet-based control strategy and rule-based control strategy, the proposed strategy has better performance in terms of the fuel economy, the system durability as well as the dynamic property.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2991519</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210314</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Green steaming: A methodology for estimating carbon emissions avoided</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Commercial shipping cannot readily reduce its dependency on fossil fuels. Ships are large energy consumers and need to carry sufficient fuel for a voyage. The principle of green steaming, when ships travel at slower speeds to arrive just-in-Time, is discussed and a methodology developed to estimate the carbon savings resulting if the industry were to adopt this practice. The method is based on public automatic identification system (AIS) data generated by commercial vessels. A speed profile is estimated for each ship, and based on observed anchoring times, potential savings are computed by back propagating the distance a ship could travel at its slowest observed speed. The methodology is demonstrated for the Port of Gothenburg. There is a discussion of how the methodology can estimate carbon emissions avoided by the global shipping industry.

It will play an important role in the assessment of carbon emissions from the shipping industry, especially under the current and future development goal of carbon neutrality. Various green technologies to reduce the carbon emissions of ships have been demonstrated and applied. Hybrid power system is one of them. Compared with traditional direct propulsion, it can significantly reduce the energy consumption and carbon emissions of ships in inland waters such as the Yangtze River. Based on the characteristics of the hybrid power system, this paper firstly analyzes the power types of the hybrid power system during ship navigation. Then, according to the principle and elements of EEDI calculation method, it puts forward the key problems that should be solved in ship EEDI calculation of hybrid power system. Then, according to different hybrid operation modes, it also puts forward the calculation method of EEDI of each power mode and the calculation method of acquired EEDI of hybrid ship.

However, it is shown that the vessels' steel hulls will act as sacrificial anodes for the grounding systems in the ports, hence accelerated corrosion of the hulls may occur. The required protective earth (PE) conductor between the hull and the grounding system on shore could also introduce touch voltages above 30 V in case of a fault, posing a safety hazard. Based on field measurements and analyses, a grounding strategy with galvanic separation in the low resistance PE conductor is recommended. It is further advised to use active and passive cathodic protection, and to reduce the set point of the impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) system to approximately 100 mV versus zinc. These measures will reduce the corrosion rate of the vessels' hulls during power delivery from shore, while avoiding transferred touch voltages.

The ambitious vision of this strategy is to reduce the total annual GHG emissions from international shipping by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008. One of the solutions to achieve this vision is to operate vessels on alternative marine fuels that generate less or no GHG emissions, like liquefied natural gas (LNG), hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, ethanol, biofuel, synthetic fuel, electricity (produced by battery), and so on. The challenge is that each alternative fuel has its own characteristic on various aspects. For instance, some alternative fuels may generate no GHG emission but can have higher risk than conventional marine fuel. Other alternative fuels may generate no GHG emission with relatively low risk, but the capital and/or operational expenditure can be significantly higher than other fuels. The main objective of this paper is to explore the properties of selected alternative marine fuels and to emphasize the necessity of integrated evaluation of them. It is concluded that the alternative marine fuels need to be comprehensively evaluated with respect to environmental impact, risk to human, and business value. Â© 2020 The Author(s).

In the United States, the maritime industry provides key transportation services for people and goods. Immediate and future legislation at the state and federal levels are beginning to push passenger vessel operators to seek more carbon-neutral propulsion methods and begin the necessary transition towards a zero-emission future. Small high-speed, zero-emission vessel concepts are being introduced in the United States, most notably the SWITCH project of San Francisco. The SWITCH project aims to put the first hydrogen fuel cell e-ferry into service in 2021. To date, the zero-emission fast ferry efforts have focused on smaller passenger vessels. This paper examines the potential design elements and operating conditions required for a large (450 passengers) high-speed vessel to meet zero-emission standards. Key ferry metrics of speed and passenger capacity are studied with this concept hull to compare a zero-emission propulsion system against a more traditional carbon-based system. To account for major project decision factors, the economics/cost and regulatory restrictions of a hydrogen fuel cell system are considered for a high-speed passenger vessel of this scope. A sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the technological and performance gains necessary for fuel cell power to match the current capabilities of carbon-based powers. Future development of zero-emission technologies is discussed to evaluate the continually improving opportunities for such a large high-speed vessel.

In this study, a novel systematic methodology is proposed for the energy management of the ship propulsion engine, which is the largest ship energy producer. The methodology employs a combination of tools including statistical analysis, compressor modelling to predict the engine airflow and energy and exergy analyses, whereas its output includes the engine operating profile, the most frequently occurring propeller curves and the engine most frequent operating points, the key performance indicators for quantitatively assessing the recorded parameters quality as well as the energy/exergy flows and the engine components exergy destruction. The methodology is implemented for three case studies for a very large crude carrier, a container ship and a bulk carrier, for which recorded data were available by using different monitoring techniques from either noon reports or automatic data acquisition systems. The derived results provide the engine operating profile demonstrating that the investigated vessels were operating in slow steaming conditions with a lower engine efficiency associated with a greater exhaust gas wasted energy. The measured data analysis demonstrates the better quality of the data recorded by automated monitoring systems and pinpoint maintenance issues of the engine components. Lastly, the exergy analysis results demonstrate that the exhaust gas and jacket cooling water provide the greater exergy flows rendering them attractive for energy saving initiatives, whereas the engine block, compressor and turbine are the engine components with the greater exergy destruction, thus requiring closer monitoring for timely identifying mitigating measures.

Power factor compensation that is usually achieved by adding capacitive load to offset the inductive load present in the system can have many benefits. As a ship power system, fuel oil costs and air pollution emissions for power generation remain low. This paper aims to establish a set of energy-savings evaluation model for benefit-cost analysis for automatic power factor compensators (APFCs) applied in marine vessels. The active power, reactive power, power factor, and diesel electric engine's oil consumption for a practical commercial vessel power system during different operating conditions were measured and analyzed. Base on the actual measurements, an APFC for marine use is designed and the possible benefits after installing the APFC are quantified to justify the investment by using two standard cost-benefit analysis methods. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to reduce effects of input parameters on the analysis results and determine the critical parameters. Analysis results can assist shipbuilding corporations and ship owners in managing energy efficiency of similar systems and building business cases for determining return on investment (ROI).</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210338</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Energy savings for ship propulsion in waves based on real-time optimal control of propeller pitch and electric propulsion</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">To reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships as required by international environmental regulations, we propose herein an energy-saving method for ships sailing on wavy seas. The effect of applying this method is investigated by a numerical study of a bulk carrier self-propelled in regular head and following waves. The method requires that the ship be equipped with a controllable-pitch propeller (CPP) and an electric propulsion motor, which are controlled in an optimal manner to anticipate impending waves, thereby minimizing energy consumption. Optimal control is implemented using a nonlinear model predictive control method that uses information within a receding horizon to calculate the adjustments, which in turn control actuators that vary the propeller-pitch angle and the drive frequency of the motor. To implement this real-time application, we use a fast algorithm for solving the model predictive control problem. As a result, for a wave steepness of 0.01 and a unity ratio of wavelength to ship length, the energy required to propel a bulk carrier without optimal control is reduced by about 10% with the optimal-control system proposed herein.

Many countries and international organizations have begun to work to mitigate the problem and drive the society towards more sustainable sources of energy. Shipping is no exception and in 2018 the IMO-International Maritime Organization set the ambitious goal of reducing the CO2 emissions of the shipping industries of at least 50% within 2050, compared to the levels of 2008. This has introduced the need to research and develop new, sustainable energy sources and power systems for ships. The REShiP projects is aimed to identify a type of ship which would be suitable for an early adoption of a carbon free or carbon neutral fuel and a matching power generation system, tailored on specific routes. A small ferry powered by a hybrid combination of liquid hydrogen-fuelled fuel cells and Lithium-ion batteries has thus been identified. A mathematical model was developed to optimize the usage of fuel cell and batteries based on the ship operative profile. A multi objective optimization was implemented to minimize system performance degradation. To support the mathematical model a 7 kW PEMFC power generating unit was assembled and relevant data have been analysed. Following a regulatory framework research and in lack of comprehensive prescriptive rules, the design of the ferry and the prototype was done in accordance with the alternative design approach based on the risk assessment methodology, reaching a level of confidence appropriate to award an approval in principle.

IMOâ€™s MARPOL Annex VI, with its future plan of applying Tier III requirements, the Energy Efficiency Design Index for new ships, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan for all ships. To assist policy formulation and follow-up, this study applies an energy consumption approach to estimate container ship emissions. The volumes of sulphur oxide (SOx), nitrous oxide (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from container ships are estimated using 2018 datasets on container shipping and average vessel speed records generated via AIS. Furthermore, the estimated reductions in SOx, NOx, PM, and CO2 are mapped for 2020. The empirical analysis demonstrates that the energy consumption approach is a valuable method to estimate ongoing emission reductions on a continuous basis and to fill data gaps where needed, as the latest worldwide container shipping emissions records date back to 2015. The presented analysis supports early-stage detection of environmental impacts in container shipping and helps to determine in which areas the greatest potential for emission reductions can be found.

Shipping accounts for nearly 3\% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it the sixth largest CO2 producer in the world. This is a result of inefficient ship design, lack of planning and optimal use of resources. As the transport sector expands, so does the pressure for a greener and cleaner maritime industry. Reducing fuel consumption is a major driver of the need for energy efficiency on ships. In this paper, due to the importance of maritime transport, we observed the impact of reducing the dimensions of the main switchboard as a contribution to energy efficiency. This contribution is not of great importance as is the case with the optimization of the navigation route, etc., but it certainly affects the weight and, thus, the fuel consumption, which contributes to energy efficiency in the designed system. The aim of this paper is to optimize the design of the main switchboard by using 2D simulations of possible bus topologies, in order to develop six different busbar models and find one that best meets the requirements. The simulation results indicate the optimal location and dimensions of the busbars in the main switchboard in accordance with the switchgear parameters. Apart from the change in layout and dimensions of the busbars, the replacement of conventional instrument transformers with new current/voltage sensors contributes to a significant reduction in the weight and size of the switchboard, which ultimately benefits energy efficiency.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/en14227567</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210351</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Design of hybrid diesel-electric energy storage systems to maximize overall ship propulsive efficiency</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The concept of hybrid cars, where a combination of prime mover and energy storage allows a more efficient use of fuel shows considerable promise.

Emissions that are produced in transient cases are higher and the developed reduction techniques deal mainly with the optimum operational point. This work, using real operational data of Post Panamax vessels, correlates daily sea state and engine loading to propose and size alternative hybrid propulsion system to reduce emissions and fuel consumption. The latter are calculated using the "as measured" fuel consumption; the bunker characteristics and widely adopted empirical formulae.

Transnational organizations such as the European Union and the International Maritime Organization monitor these emissions and have come to limit some gas emissions such as SOx, NOx, PM, and CO2. These limiting measures are all needed and welcome. However, we need more accurate data to inform and implement even more concrete policies. This study contributes to such efforts by providing calculations of the emissions of NOx, NMVOC, PM, SOx, CO, and CO2 from an oceangoing container ship during its 37-day voyage in 2019. The use of a real case scenario differentiates this study from others. We employed two conventionally used methods to make the estimations. One is the fuel-based approach (top-down) and the other is the activity-based approach (bottom-up). While there is some discrepancy of results produced by the two methods, there is also consistency in terms of percentages regarding which gas is emitted most and when. The results indicate that by taking appropriate measures such as reducing fuel consumption, and using low-sulfur fuel, as well as optimizing port traffic, the environmental damage of maritime transportation could be reduced.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s10668-021-01605-8</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210357</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Experimental investigations of hydrogen-natural gas engines for maritime applications</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">A novel ship propulsion concept employs natural gas to reduce ship emissions and improve overall ship propulsion efficiency. This concept proposes a serial integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and a natural gas engine, while anode-off gas (gas at the fuel cell exhaust) is used in the natural gas engine. This study focusses on SOFC-gas engine integration by experimentally analyzing the effects of adding hydrogen, which is the main combustible component of the fuel cell anode-off gas, in marine natural gas engines. The overall challenge is to employ the anode-off gas to improve the performance of marine natural gas engines. To study the effects of anode-off gas combustion in natural gas engines, experiments with hydrogen addition in a marine natural gas engine of 500 kW rated power were performed. Natural gas was replaced with 10 % and 20 % of hydrogen, by volume, without any penalties in terms of output power. We found that the high combustion rate of hydrogen improved combustion stability, which allowed for better air-excess ratio control. Thus allowing leaning to higher air-excess ratios and extending the, otherwise, limited operating window. Hydrogen addition also improved brake thermal efficiency by 1.2 %, while keeping NOx emissions below the maritime emission regulations. The improvement in engine efficiency with a larger operating window may help improve the load-taking capabilities of marine natural gas engines.

According to the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) recommended by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the main scope of this article is in fact to overcome the deterministic limits of the monitoring systems installed in modern ships and support technical management in decision making based on large navigation databases. The proposed statistical approach is founded on a multiple linear regression and allows for both pointwise and interval predictions of the fuel consumption. At the end of each voyage, the model can be used to alert management for a possible change in ship performance in all those situations where the actual fuel consumption lies outside the prediction interval. Moreover, the model can also be utilized to quantify the contribution to the fuel consumption due to the hull and propeller fouling, which is particularly profitable for shipping companies and operators to claim for carbon credits after a specific improvement operation.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.5957/JOSR.59.3.150012</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210361</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Parametric investigation and optimal selection of the hybrid turbocharger system for a large marine four-stroke dual-fuel engine</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Hybrid turbochargers can become an attractive solution for new built and retrofitted ship power plants, as their use can result in increasing the plant efficiency and reducing emissions. This study aims at computationally investigating the hybrid turbocharger effects on a large marine dual-fuel four-stroke engine performance and emissions characteristics as well as determining its electrical generator optimal size for the case of a ship power plant considering an actual operating profile. An existing model of a large marine four-stroke dual-fuel engine of the zero/one-dimensional type, which was developed in the commercial software GT-Power, is extended to include the hybrid turbocharger sub-model. This model is subsequently employed to carry out a parametric investigation considering a wide range for the hybrid turbocharger electric motor power. The derived results are analysed to identify the variations of the investigated dual fuel engine performance and emissions parameters in the whole engine operating envelope at both the diesel and gas modes, whilst taking into account the engine and its components operational limits. For the considered annual load profile, the results demonstrate that the optimal nominal size of the hybrid turbocharger electric motor power is 300 kW and leads to an annual energy surplus between 2% and 3% of the annually delivered engine mechanical energy. This study benefits the quantification of the hybrid turbocharger impact on large marine dual fuel four-stroke engines as well as the ship energy efficiency, thus providing useful decision support to facilitate the shipboard implementation of this technology.

This study focuses on the financial analysis of investment on waste heat recovery that has its origin in the heavy industry especially in power plants, steel mills and other high-energy fabrics. As with other industries, the waste heat recovery systems (WHRS) can also be used to reduce emissions and fuel consumption of ship engines but is still relatively new in the maritime industry and until now, the economic assessment of the installations are still not adequately covered in the scientific literature. The evaluation of the investment of the WHRS installations on ships carried out in this work used the traditional capital budgeting analysis followed by the real-option approach that includes a fuzzy model. The results were validated using data from a ferry plying between Tallinn and Helsinki. The capital budgeting analysis reveals that the investment in maritime WHR technology is economically favorable only under certain frame conditions. On the other hand, the real-option analysis shows a practical and pragmatic assessment of the WHRS investment even when implemented under high uncertainty and volatility condition in material resource markets.

The emission reductions can be attributed to the related technological advancement, including particularly the improvements in navigational performance and berthing in port, which can achieve better efficiencies and lower fluctuations in sailing speeds. The scenario modeling approach is first established based on the foreseeable development of energy policies and usage as well as ship operations. Subsequently, assessment is performed in five major ports worldwide, namely Shanghai, Singapore, Long Beach, Hamburg, Tokyo from Year 2020 to 2050. The results are compared to the corresponding projections with manned shipping to determine the probabilistic emission abatements with the gradual adoption of autonomous ships into the fleet. Overall, the results provide a better understanding of the future environmental benefits with autonomous shipping to the policymakers, shipowners, and shipping industry.

For every new ship the attained EEDI has to be calculated and not higher than the required EEDI, which is determined by the reference line value and the reduction factor defined in a set of time intervals. The aim of this paper is to analyze how the application of the required EEDI reduction factor will influence the general cargo ships GHG emission in future. These ships average lifetime is much higher compared to other ship types. Since the EEDI applies only to new ships it is interesting to analyze the effect of the EEDI implementation on their GHG emission in future and to compare it with the requirement of reaching mean global CO2 stabilization level in the atmosphere. The analysis showed that in order to reach the stabilization level a more stringent policy is required for general cargo ships which would encourage the implementation of innovative energy efficient technologies and result in lower GHG emission.

It can help climate mitigation efforts by cutting down marine fuel consumption and consequently reducing CO2 and other Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG). Due to climate change both the European Union (EU) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are analysing the inclusion of international shipping in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) in the near future or alternatively implementing a carbon tax. The paper proposes a methodology to decide the optimal speed of a vessel taking into account its characteristics and the factors that determine its economic results. The calculated cash flow can be used in valuation models. The methodology is applied for a case study for any container ship in a range from 2000 to 20,000 Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEU) on a leg of a round trip from Shanghai to Rotterdam. We calculate how speed reduction, CO2 emissions and ship owner's earnings per year may vary between a business-as-usual scenario and a scenario in which shipping is included in the ETS. The analysis reveals that the optimal speed varies with the size of the vessel and depends on several variables such as marine fuel prices, cargo freight rates and other voyage costs. Results show that the highest optimal speed is in the range of 5500-13,000 TEUs whether or not the ETS is applied. As the number of TEUs transported in a vessel increases emissions per TEU decrease. In an established freight rate market, the optimal speed fluctuates by 1.8 knots. Finally, the medium- and long-term expectations for slow steaming are analysed based on future market prices.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/en14227487</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210383</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Review of 2010: The past is black, but the future is green</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Year 2010 is, in many ways, a year that will be better forgotten. It started in the depths of a global recession, and although there has been much cause for optimism, little of that has yet to reach the shipping and shipbuilding industries in tangible form. Year 2010 may also be remembered as the year in which ship efficiency and alternative fuels began to be taken seriously. The need for efficiency has to be met by more complex, cleaner, hull forms as well as more sophisticated machinery and systems. The year ended with DNV trumpeting its environmentally-friendly VLCC design concept, Traility. In 2010, The Motorship investigated the feasibility of holding a conference about gas fueled ships in 2010. At the time, and certainly in the view of experts just 12 mo back, the idea of large ocean-going merchant ships using LNG as fuel was seen as a pipe dream. Meanwhile, a consortium of British, American, and Greek interests agreed in November 20101 to investigate the practical maritime applications for small modular reactors, in particular for commercial tanker vessels. The Strategic Research Group at Lloyds Register Hyperion Power Generation, UK designer BMT Nigel Gee and Greek ship operator Enterprises Shipping and Trading are leading a research program into nuclear propulsion, which is technically feasible and has the potential to drastically reduce the CO2 emissions from commercial shipping. The project expects to result in a concept tanker-ship design in which special attention will be paid to analysis of lifecycle cost as well as hull-form designs and structural layout, including grounding and collision protection. In addition, its latest NYK Altair container ship recently made her maiden voyage, calling at Hamburg. The NYK Super Eco Ship 2030 concept claims to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 69% against current levels, using such measures as a lightweight hull with an air-lubrication system, while the extensive use of renewable energy sources and LNG-based fuel cells will further lower the carbon footprint.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210387</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Emerging technologies in marine electric propulsion</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Increasing fuel costs and regulation of emissions are encouraging operators, shipbuilders and researchers to seek improvements in marine vessel efficiency.

Also, it is proposed to use hydrogen and ammonia as dual fuels to quantify the reduction potential of greenhouse gas emissions. An environmental impact assessment of transoceanic tanker and transoceanic freight ship is implemented to explore the impacts of fuel substituting on the environment. In the life cycle analyses, the complete transport life cycle is taken into account from manufacture of transoceanic freight ship and tanker to production, transportation and utilization of hydrogen and ammonia in the maritime vehicles. Several hydrogen and ammonia production routes ranging from municipal waste to geothermal options are considered to comparatively evaluate environmentally benign methods. Besides global warming potential, environmental impact categories of marine sediment ecotoxicity and marine aquatic ecotoxicity are also selected in order to examine the diverse effects on marine environment. Being carbon-neutral fuels, ammonia and hydrogen, yield significantly minor global warming impacts during operation. The ecotoxicity impacts on maritime environment vary based on the production route of hydrogen and ammonia. The results imply that even hydrogen and ammonia are utilized as dual fuels in the engines, the global warming potential is quite lower in comparison with heavy fuel oil driven transoceanic tankers. Geothermal energy sourced hydrogen and ammonia fuelled transoceanic tankers release about 0.98 g and 1.65 g CO2 eq. per tonne-kilometer, respectively whereas current conventional heavy fuel oil tanker releases about 5.33 g/tonne-kilometer CO2 eq. greenhouse gas emissions.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is seeking measures to reduce the CO2 emissions from ships, and their proposed Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) aim at ensuring that future vessels will be more efficient. Waste heat recovery can be employed not only to improve energy utilization efficiency but also to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, a typical conceptual large container ship employing a low speed marine diesel engine as the main propulsion machinery is introduced and three possible types of Waste Heat Recovery Systems(WHRS) are designed. To calculate the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) and Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) of the given large container ship, two software packages are developed. Impact of performance of Waste Heat Recovery Systems(WHRS), as well as different ship design parameters, have been varied to see influence of these parameters on the EEDI. From the viewpoint of operation and maintenance, lowering the ship speed and improve container load rate can greatly reduce Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) and further reduce total fuel consumption. Although the large container ship itself can reach the International Maritime Organization requirements of EEDI at the first stage, i.e. with a reduction factor 10% under the reference line value, the proposed waste heat recovery systems can improve the ship EEDI reduction factor to 20% under the reference line value.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210412</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Lithium-sulfur batteries for marine applications</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Marine vessels (MVs), such as cruise ships, submarines, cargo ships, tugboats, and yachts, whether big or small, require powerful batteries to start their engines, to run electric lights, power inverters for kettles, microwaves, induction cookers, and nowadays even air-conditioning systems. Thus, energy-efficient batteries with long life spans have become an integral part of MVs. MVs have various power requirements depending on their size, number of crew members, and mode of operation. Traditionally, lead-acid batteries were used extensively for these purposes but have now been replaced with lithium-ion batteries. Compared with their predecessors, lithium-ion batteries are 60% lighter, nontoxic, have 10 times the cycle life due to a low discharge rate and fast charging, and deliver nearly their rated capacity even at the higher discharge current with no distilled water maintenance. Lithium battery technology based on the lithium-sulfur (Li-S) system has been in the development stage for commercialization because it possesses a higher specific energy density (500Whkgâˆ’1 or more), is cost-effective, and is more eco-friendly. However, a few issues, such as shuttle reactions and electrode stability, must be addressed to make the commercialization of Li-S battery technology possible. Many companies are now involved in designing and marketing Li-S batteries for automotive, aviation, and marine applications. This chapter is focused on the importance of batteries in marine applications. The energy requirements of different MVs, the types of batteries used and their energy density and capacity, and cost analysis for installation in MVs are summarized. The introduction of developed Li-S technology in electric or hybrid MVs, especially ferries and yachts, can reduce operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

For bibliometric analysis, the bibliometrix package in the R software was used in combination with the VOSviewer software. The outcomes of bibliometric analysis are the most ranked articles, journals, authors, and institutions related to ship energy efficiency research. The bibliographic coupling analysis identified five research clusters: (1) decarbonization and emission reduction measures, (2) speed management, (3) policy and regulations, (4) economic and organizational factors, and (5) alternative energy sources.

In this study, the energetic and ecological benefits of slow steaming and gasification are studied for a container ship sailing between Shanghai and Hamburg. Resistance and propulsion characteristics in calm water are calculated using computational fluid dynamics based on the viscous flow theory for a full-scale ship, while the added resistance in waves is calculated by applying potential flow theory. The propeller operating point is determined for the design and slow steaming speeds at sea states with the highest probability of occurrence through the investigated sailing route. Thereafter, the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are calculated for a selected dual fuel engine in fuel oil- and gas-supplying modes complying with IMO Tier II and Tier III requirements. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for various slow steaming speeds compared to the design speed at different sea states, and for the gasification of a container ship. For realistic weather conditions through the investigated route, the potential reduction in CO2 emissions per year could be up to 11.66 kt/year for fuel oil mode and 8.53 kt/year for gas-operating mode. CO2 emission reduction per year due to gasification under realistic weather conditions could be up to 22 kt/year.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/jmse10050703</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210428</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Outlook of future implementation of PEMFC and SOFC onboard cruise ships</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">According to third IMO GHG Study shipping is responsible of about 2, 6% of world CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions. The dangerous effect on people is increased because emissions are concentrated in coastal areas. IMO and other bodies are engaged in imposing measures to reduce GHG emissions and improve the overall ship's energy efficiency. There are many technical and operational improvements that can help to reach these goals, but hydrogen and fuel cells remain one of the best candidates to substantially reduce emissions and fuel consumption. This paper gives an outlook of possible fuel cells applications in the marine sector and analyses the potential of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC) and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) for the on-board installation. The analysis shows the advantages that fuel cells can give in terms of emissions reductions and fuel saving, but also highlights some challenges that designers will face when implementing these technologies on a cruise ship. Both PEMFC and SOFC application in the marine sector suffer of the lack of standards and regulations from IMO and Classification Societies and high acquisition cost. While PEMFC are ready for marine application, SOFC are still in a study phase for on-board implementation. Also, the type of fuel used by these generators and the possibility of heat recovery can influence their application on-board cruise ships.

The main advantage of such systems is high reliability, better maneuverability, greater ability to optimize and significant decreasing of the engine room volume. Marine propulsion systems are required to be as energy efficient as possible and to meet environmental protection standards. This paper analyzes the impact of split injection on fuel consumption and NOx emissions of marine medium-speed diesel engines. For the needs of the research, a zero-dimensional, two-zone numerical model of a diesel engine was developed. Model based on the extended Zeldovich mechanism was applied to predict NOx emissions. The validation of the numerical model was performed by comparing operating parameters of the basic engine with data from engine manufacturers and data from sea trials of a ship with diesel-electric propulsion. The applicability of the numerical model was confirmed by comparing the obtained values for pressure, temperature and fuel consumption. The operation of the engine that drives synchronous generator was simulated under stationary conditions for three operating points and nine injection schemes. The values obtained for fuel consumption and NOx emissions for different fuel injection schemes indicate the possibility of a significant reduction in NOx emissions but with a reduction in efficiency. The results showed that split injection with a smaller amount of pilot fuel injected and a smaller angle between the two injection allow a moderate reduction in NOx emissions without a significant reduction in efficiency. The application of split injection schemes that allow significant reductions in NOx emissions lead to a reduction in engine efficiency.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/jmse8100820</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210436</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Ship fuel consumption monitoring and fault detection via partial least squares and control charts of navigation data</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">New regulations in the shipping sector aim to give greater transparency to operations and public access to CO2 emissions data. EU regulation 2015/757 became mandatory in January 2018 and urges shipping companies to set up systems for daily monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of emissions for individual ships. Manual acquisition and handling of emissions data may be allowed (e.g. bunker fuel delivery note, bunker fuel tank monitoring), but is adversely affected by uncertainty due to human intervention and will eventually be unusable for monitoring purposes. However, the massive amounts of navigation data acquired by multi-sensor systems installed on-board of modern ships have great potential to aid compliance with regulations but their use is hampered by the lack of effective analytical methods in the maritime literature. This work demonstrates a statistical framework and automatic reporting system for fuel consumption monitoring that addresses the MRV requirements needed to comply with the regulations. The framework has been applied to the Grimaldi Group's Ro-Ro Pax cruise ships and is shown, in addition, to be capable of supporting fault detection as well as verifying CO2 savings achieved after energy efficiency initiatives.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.trd.2018.11.009</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210438</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">An overview of natural gas use in ships: Necessity and engine supply</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The article consists of analysis of existing and planned air pollution from ships control and prevention tools such Marpol 73/78 Annex VI, Energy Efficiency Design Index, Energy efficiency operational indicator, Ship energy efficiency management plan, Regulation on the Monitoring Reporting and Verification of shipping emissions, Carbon tax, Maritime emission trading scheme.

In this study, firstly impacts of new marine fuels on ships have been evaluated by means of a literature review. Furthermore, repair and maintenance systems have been presented that are currently used on board ships. Subsequently, advantages of a predictive maintenance system that will reduce risk by constantly monitoring the potential critical characteristics of VLSFO over other maintenance systems have been discussed.

The EEDI is applied to every ocean-going vessel and ratified to be stringent with respect to time; the CO2 emission should be reduced by 30 % in 2022 (Phase 3) and by 40 % in 2025 (Phase 4) from the emission level of 2013. Although the LNG-fuelled propulsion system has been developed to reduce the green-house gas emission, it hardly meet the regulation in Phase 4, and consequently some fuel without green-house gas emission should be combined with LNG. This study proposes the LNG-hydrogen hybrid system of a LNG carrier with 154K, 210K, and 267K cargo capacity and discusses some issues including the relative ratio of hydrogen with respect to LNG, the size of hydrogen fuel tanks, and operating complexities to satisfy the step-by-step regulations. An appropriate ratio of hydrogen fuel to satisfy the environmental regulation is estimated to more than 12% and 27% for Phase 4 and 5 respectively. The tank size of liquid hydrogen for the ship is estimated 1,300 âˆ¼ 3,300 m3, and the power of a fuel cell is required to be 4.9 âˆ¼ 11.8 MW. Optimising the hybrid propulsion system considering the spatial, operational, and economic feasibility for the hybrid propulsion system is identified as a future challenge.

Nevertheless, mainly in relation with the most traveled routes, frequently it might happen that port facilities are congested, and the time schedule for ship load/unload operations is accordingly delayed. In this circumstance the choice is between meeting the original ETA (estimated time of arrival) and then let the ship riding at anchor or slowing down the ship in order to adjust the arrival to the actually needed time window. The latter option is called "Virtual Arrival"[l] because it consists of applying a speed reduction that fits the new time for port operations instead of arriving at the original ETA. The purpose of this paper is to investigate to what extent the Virtual Arrival policy could be a valuable option providing a reasonable energy saving for ships. The potential benefits are considerable and they result in direct saving in fuel consumption, reduction of C02 emissions and less congested port areas.

The extensive utilization of hydrogen requires massive production of green hydrogen and the development of proper infrastructure to support a sustainable supply chain. An alternative solution is based on the on-board production of hydrogen, where production units are installed on-board the vessel. Along these lines, the HYMAR project aims to test the utilization of a hydrogen production unit for on-board use. The article deals with the use of hydrogen as a fuel for internal combustion engines, taking into consideration reports from literature and the preliminary results of the HYMAR project, focusing on the environmental impact and the reduction in emissions. Experimental investigation on a marine auxiliary engine for power generation, under the HYMAR project, leads to promising results regarding the environmental footprint of the internal combustion engine when hydrogen is added in the fuel mix with increasing percentages.

In this context, a framework for the design and experimental evaluation of power-split control systems for ship propulsion is proposed. Using machine learning, data from ship operation are processed and 20 loading patterns are recognized; representative templates are extracted to be used as marine loading cycles in the energy management system development and testing. A ship propulsion model with wave disturbance is utilized to simulate realistic loading scenarios on the experimental facility. A predictive energy management system is presented, that controls the diesel engine and the electric motor/generator based on a strategy that defines the trade-off between fuel consumption and NOx emissions minimization. In addition the propeller load characteristics that are estimated and a speed predictor are utilized to aid the optimization within the 10 s prediction time window. A parametric simulation study is performed for the trade-off evaluation between fuel consumption and NOx emissions reduction potential of the control scheme. Finally, utilizing an extracted loading cycle, the energy management system is experimentally implemented and tested in real-time operation, where it has to cope with environmental disturbance rejection and follow the desired speed profile while performing the power-split control in respect to the fuel to NOx weighting strategy. Based on the experimental results in a hybrid dieselâ€“electric marine powertrain with a 260 kW diesel engine and a 90 kW electric machine, fuel consumption and NOx emissions reduction by 6% and 8.5% respectively, were achieved over the tested profile. In this framework, the capabilities of the energy management system in realistic operation conditions can be exploited and evaluated.

A challenge for electric-ship propulsion systems, however, is large propulsion-load fluctuations. To address this issue, this paper explores a new solution, namely a combined battery and flywheel (B/FW) hybrid energy storage system (HESS) as a buffer to isolate load fluctuations from the shipboard network. Our two main objectives, power-fluctuation compensation and energy saving under various operating constraints, are formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Pareto fronts, which illustrate the trade-offs between the main objectives, are obtained by using dynamic programming with the weighted sum method. To quantitatively analyze the performance of B/FW HESS, a comparative study is performed under different sea conditions, where a battery/ultra-capacitor (B/UC) HESS configuration is used as a reference in performance evaluation. Simulation results show the feasibility and effectiveness of B/FW to mitigate the load fluctuations for all-electric ships, especially at high sea states. Furthermore, a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is developed to facilitate real-time implementation of the proposed solution. A performance comparison between the proposed MPC energy management strategy and the global dynamic programming is performed, and this comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed MPC strategy.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.12.098</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210466</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Integration of solid oxide fuel cell and internal combustion engine for maritime applications</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The current literature on solid oxide fuel cell and internal combustion engine (SOFC-ICE) integration is focused on the application of advanced combustion technologies operating as bottoming cycles to generate a small load share. This integration approach can pose challenges for ships such as restricted dynamic capabilities and large space and weight requirements. Furthermore, the potential of SOFC-ICE integration for marine power generation has not been explored. Consequently, the current work proposes a novel approach of SOFC-ICE integration for maritime applications, which allows for high-efficiency power generation while the SOFC anode-off gas (AOG) is blended with natural gas (NG) and combusted in a marine spark-ignited (SI) engine for combined power generation. The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential of the proposed SOFC-ICE integration approach with respect to system efficiency, emissions, load sharing, space and weight considerations and load response. In this work, a verified zero-dimensional (0-D) SOFC model, engine experiments and a validated AOG-NG mean value engine model is used. The study found that the SOFC-ICE integration, with a 67â€“33 power split at 750 kWe power output, yielded the highest efficiency improvement of 8.3% over a conventional marine natural gas engine. Simulation results showed that promising improvements in efficiency of 5.2%, UHC and NOx reductions of about 30% and CO2 reductions of about 12% can be achieved from a 33â€“67 SOFC-ICE power split with comparatively much smaller increments in size and weight of 1.7 times. Furthermore, the study concluded that in the proposed SOFC-ICE system for maritime applications, a power split that favours the ICE would significantly improve the dynamic capabilities of the combined system and that the possible sudden and large load changes can be met by the ICE.

Among the different means of transportation, global maritime transport is responsible for 2\%-3\% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and it is predicted to increase to 17\% by 2050 if no changes are adapted. Hence, the international maritime organization (IMO) has targeted to reach a 50\% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 compared to 2008. Hence, alternative energy sources shall be utilized in order to meet these strict GHG emissions reduction targets, where battery- and hydrogen-fed fuel cells can play a vital role in such aspects. Since the output of these two energy sources is unregulated dc voltage, their connection to the whole ship power system can be accomplished in several ways, where each way has its features, in addition to utilizing different power conditioning stages (PCSs), and these features are not well clarified and compared in the literature. Hence, this article presents an overview of the possible integration schemes that can be utilized in fuel cell- and battery-fed vessels, which is supported with a comparative assessment. This is also presented along with highlighting the state-of-the-art PCSs that are available in the market and can be utilized in these integration schemes within marine vessels.

Hence, the SEEMP with various navigation strategies can play an important part of e-navigation under modern integrated bridge systems. This study proposes a machine-intelligence-based data handling framework for ship performance and navigation data to improve the quality of the respective navigation strategies. The prosed framework is divided into two main sections of pre and post processing. The data pre-processing is an onboard application that consists of sensor faults detection, data classification, and data compression steps. The data post processing is a shore-based application (i.e., in data centers) and that consists of data expansion, integrity verification, and data regression steps.

Several shipping companies have configured on-board bunker tanks and systems, approving them to be used for LNG. High oil and energy prices around the world are also influencing shipping companies, to use LNG. LNG is providing power for the existing carriers, a few ferries, and a number of offshore vessels in Norway. Several ferries and a coastguard cutter from Norwegian shipping service are also being powered by LNG. A large of ships are being powered by LNG in the country, as it has sufficient LNG, to deliver as bunkers, while willing to reduce both air pollution and marine pollution risk.

This paper investigates the optimal operation of diesel generators in marine power systems, particularly the PSV. The investigation is mainly focused on carbon dioxide emission and fuel consumption in a ship's mission. In this regard, this paper presents a clear optimization strategy, called a trip-ahead to determine the best operation schedule of generators to supply the electricity demand for the next days of a PSV. The PSV has six generators (i.e., four primary and two auxiliary diesel generators) with two different fuel consumption curves and carbon dioxide emission. The trip-ahead algorithm's objective functions consist of minimization of cost and emission during the complete PSV mission. A power level is assigned to each generator for each hour of the next day of a 5-day trip, taking into account the fuel consumption per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The prepared sample of the load profile is the historical demand records of a real PSV. Additionally, this paper compares the results of the proposed approach with other optimization algorithms such as the Genetic algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO), and the software HOMER Pro optimization tool. Moreover, this paper presents the sensitivity analysis to compensate for possible errors in prediction demand for the next trip. The results prove the proposed algorithm in comparing GA and PSO is more accurate and the calculation velocity of the proposed algorithm when objective functions are cost and emission is about 27% and 46% better than the PSO and about 36% and 62% better than the GA, respectively.

Current and future green ship are expected to comply against demanding environmental standards, requirements for new equipment and for sustainability within the context of lifecycle performance. And also there have been a lot of argument and discussion during the establishment of environmental convention and it is still on-going. The rationality or technical background are still challenged. However, it is to be stressed that the global measures to reduce the emission from the ship is agreed by all stakeholders and once the level playing field is given, no one is free from implementation of the common rules and regulation. Furthermore, there is a consensus that this will, in return, bring shipping and shipbuilding industries sustainable growth. This paper in view of above, I can conclude that first, designer and ship operators have to technically cooperate each other to find out what is the most appropriate method for reduction of emission from ships in view of vessels' usage although there exist some commercial barriers. Second, green ship technology is not necessary an innovative one. There are many technologies which become cost effective due to high oil price. Niche technology is also available. Third, EEDI is not the representation of overall vessel's energy efficiency. It should be monitored and lowered continuously in the future. Fourth, the benefit coming from fuel saving should be shared by all stakeholders in such a way that further development is made possible and that level playing of every stakeholders is also possible. Fifth, related R&amp;D should be well recognized and coordinated, especially for the IT convergence technology.

However, a ship can rarely follow pre-defined speeds because dynamic sea environments lead to continuous speed variation. In this paper, a voyage optimization method is proposed to optimize ship engine power to reduce fuel and air emissions. It is a combination of dynamic programming and genetic algorithm to solve voyage planning in three-dimensions. In this method, the engine power is discretized into several levels. The potential benefit of using this algorithm is investigated by a medium-size chemical tanker. A ship's actual sailing is used to demonstrate benefits of the proposed method. On average 3.4% of fuel-saving and emission reduction can be achieved than state-of-the-art deterministic methods. If compared with the actual full-scale measurements, on average 5.6% reduction of fuel consumption and GHG emissions (about 275 tons) can be expected by the proposed method for the six case study voyages.

Fresh water produced will be used for drinking, cleaning and washing purposes, contributing to the high demand consumption particularly onboard passenger ships. The main idea for the proposed fresh water generator is to use the waste heat recovered from scavenging air to provide the heat required to evaporate sea water under vacuum converting it into steam. Energy conservation system for exhaust gases in container ships has a lot of advantages which include reducing fuel consumption for ships, increasing the overall efficiency and reducing the pollutant emissions which go out into the atmosphere. Results of the suggested fresh water generator indicated that for a typical installed propulsion power of 3350 hp consuming 10 ton of fuel oil per day, 8 tons of fresh water will be produced. This amount will be sufficient for 20 persons per day. For a number of diesel engines equipped with the proposed fresh water generator the specific fresh water generation was found to be about 100 gm/hp/hr. Combined heat and power plant is one of the methods used to improve engine performances and a better environment which can reduce emissions and fuel consumption by 4.5%.

FC is analyzed for (i) equal load sharing among DGs in AC architecture, (ii) equal load sharing among DGs in DC architecture and (iii) optimal load sharing among DGs in DC architecture using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Due to the presence of non-linearity in Specific FC (SFC) curves of the diesel engines, the PSO algorithm is used. The SFC-vs-load relationship obtained from Brake SFC (BSFC) map of the diesel engines is characterized using a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) interpolation. A solution to problem has been attained by comparing yearly fuel consumption in the three cases for the load profile of target vessel.

For this reason, great attention has been placed on alternative zero-carbon fuels, specifically ammonia, which is considered a promising solution for shipping decarbonisation. In this respect, a novel ammonia-powered fuel-cell configuration is proposed as an energy-efficient power generation configuration with excellent environmental performance. However, there are safety and reliability concerns of the proposed ammonia-powered system that need to be addressed prior to its wider acceptance by the maritime community. Therefore, this is the first attempt to holistically examine the safety, operability, and reliability of an ammonia fuel-cell-powered ship, while considering the bunkering and fuel specifications. The proposed methodology includes the novel combination of a systematic preliminary hazard identification process with a functional and model-based approach for simulating the impact of various hazards. Furthermore, the critical faults and functional failures of the proposed system are identified and ranked according to their importance. This work can be beneficial for both shipowners and policymakers by introducing technical innovation and for supporting the future regulatory framework.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/safety7040080</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210546</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Facilities for bunkering of liquefied natural gas in ports</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Emission reduction targets are driving a new way of thinking and a range of technological solutions within the shipping and port sectors. So far, four major solutions have been identified for cleaner ship fuels: (i) Marine Gas Oil, (ii) Heavy Fuel Oil + Scrubber, (iii) Liquefied Natural Gas - herein referred to as LNG, and (iv) Methanol. From those alternatives, most experts recognise LNG as the most developed fuel solution, both in the short- and in the medium-term. In 2014, the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) as well as the International Gas Union (IGU) reported a significant growth of terminals for LNG liquefaction and regasification. Moreover, the European Commission, as part of its Clean Power for Transport package, has adopted in 2014 a Directive `on the deployment of alternative fuels, recharging and refuelling infrastructure'. Nevertheless, there are several constraints that need to be addressed yet, more particularly in LNG importing countries in order to meet the future demand of the expected LNG-powered fleet. They include facilities for storage and transhipment of LNG for fuelling berths, barges and ships. This paper provides an overview of the use of LNG for the maritime industry and examines its potential for future growth on the basis of the LNG-powered fleet (current and in order) and planned expansion of LNG bunkering facilities, mainly in European ports. Most data here presented come from a variety of sources including international databases such as IHS Maritime, ports websites, and reports from LNG-related organisations. In addition, the results from past and current EU-funded projects in this field were reviewed and consultations were conducted among representatives from participating ports. Overall, it was found that the LNG powered fleet is expanding slowly and the trend is towards building LNG-propelled vessels for smaller ship sizes and short distances. Although Norway is the newbuilding front runner, other countries, mainly in Europe (e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, and Malta), have ordered an important amount of new buildings. Similarly, European ports are expanding considerably their LNG bunkering capacities. Remarkable are the activities conducted by the ports of Spain and Italy with planned expansion for LNG handling and storage facilities beyond 2020. Finally, with regards to regulations, while international standards have been adopted for the construction and operation of LNG powered ships and crew's training, no harmonisation exists yet for LNG facilities in ports. The latter have allowed major ports to undertake independent initiatives to overcome the situation. (C) 2016 The Authors.

In a context of rising discussions concerning the use of cleaner fuels such as LNG and methanol in shipping, fuel cells are expected to become an increasingly viable solution for onboard power generation. In particular, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) can offer high electrical efficiency, power density and reliability with the possibility of combined heat, hydrogen and power production, which make them suitable for energy-intensive applications with a diverse demand (e.g., cruise ships) by integrating other complementary technologies. In this paper, we investigate the potential for energy and emission savings in relation to the use of SOFCs on cruise ships. Given the limited ability of SOFCs to deal with fast load changes and start/stop cycles, the SOFCs are expected to tackle the baseload, while a combination of batteries and internal combustion engines are complementary for handling peak loads. The proposed system is tested and optimized for a case study of a cruise ship operating in the Baltic Sea. Based on reference operational profiles for heat and electricity demand, the design of the system is optimized. The system proves particularly performant, with an overall efficiency close to 70% and a potential lifetime economic performance in line with conventional systems powered by Diesel engines.

The current requirements for a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 represent a challenge for maritime transport, as there is no effective solution to reduce this emissions from ships. Thus, the current problem is represented by insufficient methods to reduce COx2 emissions on board ships, in particular for ships which are in service for more than 10 years, which are the most affected by these environmental requirements, since their design did not take into account the reduction of ecological parameters. In this context, even if military vessels are not subject to IMO GHG emission reduction requirements, they must be aligned with global emissions reduction efforts. This article presents actually operational and technological solutions to reduce COx2 emissions that can be deployed on board military vessels, until other technical solutions or power supply solutions for non-polluting renewable energy aggregates are identified.

This sustainability depends on the fluctuation of the fuel price market, compulsory international maritime organization environmental regulations and the shipowners policy regarding the energy-saving and their commitment in the reduction of greenhouse gas emission. To ensure a sustainable competitiveness and compliance with environmental requirements of their fleets, the shipping companies have implemented several innovative solutions. Some innovative solutions might be implemented at ship design stage, while others might be implemented at ship operation stage. This paper focuses on the solutions which might be implemented at the operation stage, i.e. ship speed optimization, weather routing optimization, ship trim optimization and hull and propeller condition based maintenance. The effectiveness of these solutions has been demonstrated through study of ship voyages performance reports and simulation of case study.

This study examines the greening of the Norwegian fleet through a structural equation model based upon 246 survey responses. Although our model does not show a significant direct relationship between long-term orientation and emission reductions, we do find that long-term orientation is indirectly related to emission reductions because of its relationships with green strategy and green innovation.

However, increasing fuel costs and regulatory pressure such as the restrictions placed on sulphur content have increased interest in the use of alternative fuels. A number of alternative fuels have been identified and may be viable for use within the maritime sector including straight vegetable oil (SVO) as an alternative to HFO in low speed engines, biodiesel to replace MDO/MGO in low to medium speed engines and bio-liquefied natural gas (bio-LNG) in gas engines using LNG. The potential sources of biomass feedstocks, conversion pathways and technologies are identified. The key parameters limiting their potential application are examined, in particular, availability, technological development, technical integration, and operational consequences. A proposed solution to overcome these limitations is recommended. The effective implementation of these strategies will enable the more widespread use of biofuels in marine applications, significantly reducing emissions from ships and improving global air quality and also protecting the ecological environment.

This article considers a ferry ship supplied by fuel cells (FCs) and batteries as the main sources of ship's power. Based on the designers' and owners' preferences, different scenarios can be considered for managing the operation of the FCs and batteries in all-electric marine power systems. In this article, while considering different constraints of the system, six operating scenarios for the set of FCs and batteries are proposed. Impacts of each proposed scenario on the optimal daily scheduling of FCs and batteries and operation costs of the ship are calculated using a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. Model predictive control (MPC) is also applied to consider the deviations from hourly forecast demand. Moreover, since the efficiency of FCs varies for different output powers, the impacts of applying a linear model for FCs' efficiency are compared with the proposed nonlinear model and its related deviations from the optimal operation of the ship are investigated. The proposed model is solved by GAMS software using actual system data and the simulation results are discussed. Finally, detailed real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) simulation outcomes and comparative analysis are presented to confirm the adaptation capability of the proposed strategy.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1109/TTE.2020.2970674</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210569</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Toward energy saving and environmental protection by implementation of autonomous ship</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The energy saving and environmental protection remain the main pillars of the maritime industry's sustainability enhancement.

Batteries and marine fuel cells have shown promise on smaller vessels but the flexible approach needed to use these technologies as a power source for larger, oceangoing is only now beginning to emerge. In comparison to the baseline, powering the ship with an ESS is moderately cheaper and reduces yearly CO2 emissions by 9.6%. Fuel cell technology using H2 from renewable sources cuts emissions entirely but costs around four times more than the baseline. When the H2 for the fuel cells is produced with natural gas, yearly cost comes down by almost half compared to when sustainably sourced hydrogen is used, emissions are greater, but still 25% lower than the baseline. In an investigation, if all 283 merchant ships below 3500 gt were to install ESS, a total of 164,239 ton of CO2 would be saved.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210594</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Optimal Control Strategies of Fuel cell/Battery Based Zero-Emission Ships: A Survey</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Zero-emission ships (ZE-ships) concept has been introduced as a promising solution in reducing the greenhouse gases (GHG) emission in marine shipping industry.

To respect environmental restrictions, especially SOx emissions limits, ship owners and operators can still use heavy fuel oil and marine gas oil as bunker fuels as long as the NOx/SOx emissions are limited by using adequate technologies. Another option which fulfills emission regulations is the LNG as a bunker fuel. The use of LNG as a ship fuel offers many advantages mostly the emission regulation respect.

The public transportation and commercial vehicle sectors have already begun implementing electric vehicles to meet the emission reduction requirements that are being put in place around the world. It is time that the commercial shipping sector joined them by working towards the electrification of ships and possibly using large batteries as fuel. However, there are some concerns with the ability to charge batteries during long voyages and the weight addition that large batteries would bring. One way to reduce GHG emissions in port is by cold ironing a ship or plugging in a ship to an onshore power source instead of using onboard diesel generators when ships are at port. This is effective because the main propulsion does not need power while in port. However, to ensure that the integrity of the onshore grid is not affected by this additional heavy load that may arise from the loads onboard the vessel, these loads must be analyzed before connecting them to the onshore grid. In this paper, to address these issues, this paper aims to investigate the power quality of the distribution side of TN General Rudder, a Texas A\&amp;M University Galveston's owned ship. Based on the distribution system's harmonics content and power quality, the authors propose an active filter on the secondary side to reduce the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). The proposed filter results in a decrease of 90\% total harmonic distortion, leading to increased efficiency and system performance. Further, the impact of load on the onboard diesel generator and the onshore electrical grid is also examined.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1109/CENCON51869.2021.9627303</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210604</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Adaptive Power Management of Hierarchical Controlled Hyrid Shipboard Microgrids</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Shipboard microgrids (SMGs) are distinguished by the heavy propulsion system that can vary largely in a short time. Consequently, this variation shifts the optimum operating points of the diesel engines that leads to increase the overall emissions and operational costs. Moreover, power fluctuations caused by the dynamic loads such as propulsion motors along with the lack of cold-ironing facilities at both ends of seaports make it even worse. Therefore, the application of energy storage systems (ESSs) with proper coordination is becoming very popular for ships to improve the energy management, and thus decreases the fuel consumption. The aim of this paper is to firstly highlights different architectures of SMGs and the benefits the ESS can brings into them, then proposes an enhanced hierarchical control-based energy management scheme that is suitable for SMGs operations during an islanded and grid-connected operation. The proposed method based on the ESSs supports the diesel generators to enable them to operate in the optimum window recommended by the diesel engines company, which significantly decreases fuel consumption, operational costs, and emissions. Furthermore, to provide a linkage between SMG and the grid during port stays, conventional P - f and Q - V droop control strategy is adopted to import and export power to the seaport load or the grid for emergency purposes referred to in this study as Ship-to-X operation. The enhanced hierarchical control is capable of optimally shifting the modes for efficient and reliable operation and reducing specific fuel consumption. The performance of the proposed scheme is adopted and validated with satisfactory results of a practical hybrid SMG in a MATLAB/SIMULINK environment.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3153109</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210606</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Enabling Technologies for Sustainable All - Electric Hybrid Vessels</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The global marine fleets have been reported to consume approximately 300 million tons of fuel annually and contribute 2.8\% of global greenhouse gases emissions (GHG). It is widely projected that the numbers will continue to grow, predominantly driven by the increase in global trades and energy demand from emerging countries. In recent years, enabling technologies, such as hybrid electrical propulsion system and advanced power management strategies, have been developed and introduced to the marine industries not only to reduce fuel consumption, but also to adhere to the increasingly stringent regulations on emissions by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Such technologies are especially critical for vessels that operate in the water near urban areas, such as ferries and tugs, which may contribute up to 15\% of the global marine fleet fuel consumption. In this paper, the design and integration of hybrid electrical propulsion systems, with the use of modern DC distribution and energy storage systems, will be discussed and compared to conventional systems. The benefits of hybrid all-electric power and propulsion system in terms of fuel and energy consumption, emission reduction, performance, as well as system redundancy are presented in this paper.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210612</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">AI-Aided Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial 6G Solutions for Sustainable Maritime Networking</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The maritime industry is experiencing a technological revolution that affects shipbuilding, operation of both seagoing and inland vessels, cargo management, and working practices in harbors. This ongoing transformation is driven by the ambition to make the ecosystem more sustainable and cost-efficient. Digitalization and automation help achieve these goals by transforming shipping and cruising into a much more cost- and energy-efficient and decarbonized industry segment. The key enablers in these processes are always-available connectivity and content delivery services, which can not only aid shipping companies in improving their operational efficiency and reducing carbon emissions, but also contribute to enhanced crew welfare and passenger experience. Due to recent advancements in integrating high-capacity and ultra-reliable terrestrial and non-terrestrial networking technologies, ubiquitous maritime connectivity is becoming a reality. To cope with the increased complexity of managing these integrated systems, this article advocates the use of artificial intelligence and machine-learning-based approaches to meet the service requirements and energy efficiency targets in various maritime communications scenarios.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1109/MNET.104.2100351</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210615</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Electricity generation from large marine vessel engine jacket water heat</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">As world trade grows, fuel prices increase, and International Maritime Organization (IMO) emissions requirements tighten, there is more demand for the marine industry to employ innovative means of reducing the fuel consumption and emissions of shipping vessels. The main engines of large shipping vessels produce a large quantity of low temperature heat, but this valuable heat energy is transferred to cooling systems and rejected to the oceans as waste. At the same time, the electrical needs of shipping vessels are sustained by burning diesel fuel to run generators. Calnetix Technologies, in partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, has developed the Hydrocurrentâ„¢ 125EJW Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), a modularized system capable of absorbing the waste heat of main engine jacket water and converting it into grid-quality electric power. By combining this renewable source with the existing non-renewable source (engine gensets) a unique renewable-non-renewable hybrid power system is realized with minimal changes to overall ship power train. This novel hybrid system can be applied to all new and existing ships and allow for further integration into ship systems with available waste heat. Shipping vessels such as tankers, bulk carriers, and container vessels are typically equipped with a category 3 marine diesel engine for main propulsion. A 30 MW engine, a most common engine size, utilizes 200-300 m3/hr of jacket water regulated to a heated temperature of 80-95 C. When integrated into the jacket water and sea water loops, the ORC can produce up to 125 kW of gross grid-quality electric power. This adds an immense benefit to the ship. To produce the same amount of power, a diesel generator consumes as much as 250 metric tons of diesel fuel per year, generates emissions, and requires significant maintenance. Calnetix Technologies has leveraged its core technologies to develop the ORC into a reliable, high efficiency, compact and modular design. The turbo-generator or Integrated Power Module (IPM) is a hermetically sealed, high speed radial turbine coupled to a permanent magnet generator supported by magnetic bearings. Power from the IPM is converted by a high efficiency power converter supplying the ship with reliable power. The integrated design of the ORC along with the sophistication of its controls systems ensures essential ship functions are undisturbed under all conditions. The ORC is designed to comply with Nippon Kaiji Kyokai and Lloyd's Register marine regulations and sea trials are anticipated to take place in 2015.

In particular, the International Maritime Organization has enacted many regulations on ship emissions, and the industry has increasingly focused on the development and application of low-carbon marine fuels. The use of low carbon alternative fuels can effectively solve the current environmental and energy problems. At present, the alternative fuels available for ships include liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol, biodiesel, hydrogen and ammonia, etc. In the short term, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol technology is more mature, which can be applied to ships. In the long term, biodiesel, hydrogen fuel and ammonia fuel will inevitably become the mainstream of alternative fuels for ships. However, there are some challenges in the use of alternative fuels, such as leakage of liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas, low calorific value of methanol and biodiesel, and difficult storage of hydrogen and ammonia. This work will summarize and analyze the utilization potentiality of low carbon alternative fuel, low carbon combustion technologies for ships, and some of the new clean power technologies, which has important guiding significance for the development of low carbon fuel for ships in the future.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.seta.2022.102762</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210625</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Environmental and operative impact of the electrification of a double-ended ferry</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The increasing sensibility to the environment protection and emission reduction in the atmosphere is also influencing the maritime shipping.

Moreover, a hybrid-electric system can be combined with the exploitation of green fuel, increasing the potential reduction of total emissions. However, the final efficiency, both in term of emission reduction and expected operative expenditure, is strongly influenced by the operative profile of the vessel.

In this study, a new integrated, model-based design and optimization method for hybrid electric propulsion system of a marine vessel (harbor tugboat) has been introduced. The sizes of key hybrid powertrain components, especially the Li-ion battery energy storage system (ESS), which can greatly affect the shipâ€™s life-cycle cost (LCC), have been optimized using the fuel efficiency, emission and lifecycle cost model of the hybrid powertrain system. Moreover, the control strategies for the hybrid system, which is essential for achieving the minimum fuel consumption and extending battery life, are optimized. For a given powertrain architecture, the optimal design of a hybrid marine propulsion system involves two critical aspects: the optimal sizing of key powertrain components, and the optimal power control and energy management. In this work, a bi-level, nested optimization framework was proposed to address these two intricate problems jointly. The upper level optimization aims at component size optimization, while the lower level optimization carries out optimal operation control through dynamic programming (DP) to achieve the globally minimum fuel consumption and battery degradation for a given vessel load profile. The optimized Latin hypercube sampling (OLHS), Kriging and the widely used Expected Improvement (EI) online sampling criterion are used to carry out â€œsmall dataâ€&#x9d; driven global optimization to solve this nested optimization problem. The obtained results showed significant reduction of the vessel LCC with the optimized hybrid electric powertrain system design and controls. Reduced engine size and operation time, as well as improved operation efficiency of the hybrid system also greatly decreased the GHG emissions compared to traditional mechanical propulsion.

However, such systems could be constrained by high power source degradation and energy costs. Cost-effective energy management strategies are essential for such hybrid systems to mitigate the high costs. This article presents a Double Q reinforcement learning based energy management system for such systems to achieve near-optimal average voyage cost. The Double Q agent is trained using stochastic power profiles collected from continuous monitoring of a passenger ferry, using a plug-in hybrid fuel cell and battery propulsion system model. The energy management strategies generated by the agent were validated using another test dataset collected over a different period. The proposed methodology provides a novel approach to optimal use hybrid fuel cell and battery propulsion systems for ships.

A method is presented here for drawing up an economic assessment of both these techniques under uncertainty. It enables the best option to be selected at any given time taking into account fuel prices (spot and futures), scrubber installation costs, the time that the vessel operates in an Emission Control Area (ECA) and the remaining useful lifetime of the vessel. The paper also considers the possibility of an unexpected change from a non-ECA navigation area to an ECA. The assessment is carried out in a manner consistent with marine diesel and crude oil spot and futures market quotes. Our results show the net present value of investing in the installation of scrubbers and investing in changing fuel types for different assumptions on how vessels are operated. We also analyse increases in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions as a consequence of using scrubbers and how they affects the financial analysis if such incremental emissions must be paid under a CO2 pricing mechanism.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.trd.2017.09.017</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210634</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Data Driven Fleet Monitoring and Circular Economy</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The maritime industry is intensively embracing green thinking.

Shipping adopts policies to comply with the set target, including ship redesign, structural retrofit, use of low-carbon material, and the installation of emission abatement technologies. All these approaches pave the way to circularity in the maritime economy, abandoning the linear model in vessel lifetime and adopting lean management, re-manufacturing, and re-usability of the asset. To this end, in the SmartShip project, we give prominence to data-driven ship monitoring by delivering an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) \&amp; Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled holistic cloud-based maritime performance and monitoring system.

Under the Protocol, Japan has an obligation of greenhouse gas (CO2 etc) emissions reduction of 6% below 1990 levels for the first commitment period of 2008-2012. The restriction concerning the exhaust of NOx and SOx by ships is discussed in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Under the Ministry's of Land Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) national research project named the Super Eco-Ship Project, the National Maritime Research Institute of Japan (NMRI) has been played major role of it since April 2001. Super Eco-Ship would embody a technical breakthrough in meeting certain requirements of coastal shipping such as reducing the burden on the environment and the logistics costs and improving the living and working conditions on board. Super eco-ship has highly efficient electrical propulsion system featuring the podded propulsor with contra-rotating propeller (CRP). Advanced concept and systems are applied in the research and development of the Super Eco-Ship. Flexibility in the arrangement of main engine and in the hull form design is realized by the electric propulsion system. New design tools based advanced concept and methodology are applied. Hull form design method by means of CFD simulation and CAD are performed to design optimum hull form for electric propulsion system. The high propulsive efficiency due to the combination with the optimum hull design and podded propulsor enables the reduction of CO2 compared with the conventional ship. The podded propulsor with CRP enables drastically good maneuverability and flexible control system in ship operation as well as high propulsive efficiency. The pilot becomes easy operation in berthing time by the control system of the podded propulsor. In August 2004, a reliability test run of a prototype of the propulsor including the motors and sealing/bearing was completed in a dock.The practicality of poded propulsor with CRP was confirmed from this result. In this paper, the results of this test and environmental assessment of super eco-ship is reported.

An overview of potential application, analysis of resources availability, and stakeholder readiness on the topic are provided; related challenges are also identified and further examined. The potential performance of methanol as a fuel is discussed and evaluated via two different perspectives (the shipowner perspective and the government one) through case studies of two passenger ships owned by the shipping company Pelayaran Indonesia (PELNI): MV. Labobar and MV. Gunung Dempo. As shipowners tend to look very closely at the economic aspects, a feasibility study is performed by developing a combinatorial scenario approach based on the combination of economic measures of merit (NPV and payback period) along with a technical scenario (main-pilot fuel setup); the variables included in the calculation are: ship age, ship productivity, and macro-economy conditions. Regarding the government perspective, the main issues are environmental protection and policy compliance. These issues are evaluated by examining six emission types (NOx, SOx, CO2, CH4, N2O, and PM). Additionally, since there is a trade-off situation in government subsidies between the government and shipowner interests, an optimization and sensitivity analysis is performed by utilizing a combinatorial scenario model to determine optimum methanol price and external variables influencing the decision to support further use of methanol in the Indonesian market. An important finding was that Indonesia has certain advantages/drives to introduce methanol as a marine fuel. However, methanol competitiveness is mainly dependent on ship productivity and the price difference between methanol and marine diesel oil (MDO). Additionally, policy analysis (through an optimization approach) could be one of the government options in order to determine the optimum condition in establishing methanol as a marine fuel. Finally, short, medium, and long term recommendations are also provided as the basis for future consideration.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3940/rina.2020.a2.590</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210670</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">LNG as fuel for a deep sea dry bulk carrier</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">New environmental regulations indicate that a 'business as usual' approach is no longer an option towards sustainable shipping. LNG is one of the potential alternative solutions to help meet the specified IMO fuel sulphur content limits since it contains only traces of sulphur. Gas and dual fuel (DF) engines utilizing the Otto combustion process can produce NOx emissions below the IMO Tier III limits, and the C/H ratio of LNG allows a significant fuel based reduction of CO2 emissions also. This paper discusses the challenges involved and how these were met when considering LNG as fuel in an ocean-going dry bulk carrier, with a focus on the main challenges involved with CAPEX and engine technologies and their effect on vessel design. The study was conducted by Arista Shipping in conjunction with the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) and WÃ¤rtsilÃ¤, and was based on a representative bulk carrier design, an 82,000 dwt Kamsarmax vessel, which was selected as the project platform due to its proven design and high cargo capacity.

Recently, new regulations are being enforced in special geographical areas to limit the amount of emissions from the ships. This fact, together with the high fuel prices, is driving the marine industry toward the improvement of the energy efficiency of ships. Although more sophisticated and complex engine designs can improve significantly of the energy systems on ships, waste heat recovery arises as the most effective technique for the reduction of the energy consumption. In this sense, it is estimated that around 50\% of the total energy from the fuel consumed in a ship is wasted and rejected through liquid and gas streams. The primary heat sources for waste heat recovery are the engine exhaust and coolant. In this work, we present a study on the integration of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) in an existing ship, for the recovery of the main and auxiliary engines (AE) exhaust heat. Experimental data from the engines on the cruise ship M/S Birka Stockholm were logged during a port-toport cruise from Stockholm to Mariehamn, over a period of 4 weeks. The ship has four main engines (ME) Wartsila 5850 kW for propulsion, and four AE 2760 kW which are used for electrical generation. Six engine load conditions were identified depending on the ship's speed. The speed range from 12 to 14 kn was considered as the design condition for the ORC, as it was present during more than 34\% of the time. In this study, the average values of the engines exhaust temperatures and mass flow rates, for each load case, were used as inputs for a model of an ORC. The main parameters of the ORC, including working fluid and turbine configuration, were optimized based on the criteria of maximum net power output and compactness of the installation components. Results from the study showed that an ORC with internal regeneration using benzene as working fluid would yield the greatest average net power output over the operating time. For this situation, the power production of the ORC would represent about 22\% of the total electricity consumption on board. These data confirmed the ORC as a feasible and promising technology for the reduction of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of existing ships.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1115/1.4031145</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210685</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Marine Ancillary Diesel Engine Emissions Reduction Using Advanced Fuels</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Large transoceanic ships use marine ancillary diesel engines for generating electricity, which, on the other hand, produce a remarkable amount of harmful emissions during the combustion process.

To achieve this, ship designers need to look across all potential areas for improvements to the propulsion and manoeuvring systems, to the hull, and for all systems to be integrated. Rolls-Royce looks to the hull design as the starting point. The company cites its UT design, primarily applied to offshore vessels as an example of what can be achieved. The next step is to ensure that all parts of the ship - engines, propellers, control systems, maneuvering, navigation, cargo systems - work in harmony and, together, create an efficient machine. An actual example of an "integrated" ship, the 4400-dwt Bergen Star coastal tanker, was cited. The Nord Vest Consult 604PT design achieves a typical increase in cargo volume of 5-7% and improved course stability as well as improved fuel consumption and lower emissions. The biggest contribution to lower emissions comes from the choice of prime mover. The most obvious choice is a low-NOx diesel engine, like the Bergen B32-40E. For the future, Rolls-Royce is participating in the EU Felicitas marine fuel cells program, researching solid oxide fuel cells for marine applications.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210705</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Emissions tradeoffs among alternative marine fuels: Total fuel cycle analysis of residual oil, marine gas oil, and marine diesel oil</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Worldwide concerns about sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions from ships are motivating the replacement of marine residual oil (RO) with cleaner, lower-sulfur fuels, such as marine gas oil (MGO) and marine diesel oil (MDO). Vessel operators can use MGO and MDO directly or blended with RO to achieve environmental and economic objectives. Although expected to be much cleaner in terms of criteria pollutants, these fuels require additional energy in the upstream stages of the fuel cycle (i.e., fuel processing and refining), and thus raise questions about the net impacts on greenhouse gas emissions (primarily carbon dioxide {[}CO2]) because of production and use. This paper applies the Total Energy and Environmental Analysis for Marine Systems (TEAMS) model to conduct a total fuel cycle analysis of RO, MGO, MDO, and associated blends for a typical container ship. MGO and MDO blends achieve significant (70-85\%) SOx emissions reductions compared with RO across a range of fuel quality and refining efficiency assumptions. We estimate CO2 increases of less than 1\% using best estimates of fuel quality and refinery efficiency parameters and demonstrate how these results vary based on parameter assumptions. Our analysis suggests that product refining efficiency influences the CO2 tradeoff more than differences in the physical and energy parameters of the alternative fuels, suggesting that modest increases in CO2 could be offset by efficiency improvements at some refineries. Our results help resolve conflicting estimates of greenhouse gas tradeoffs associated with fuel switching and other emissions control policies.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3155/1047-3289.58.4.538</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210707</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Review of Marine Low Speed Engine Technology Development [èˆ¹ç”¨ä½Žé€Ÿå&#x8f;‘åŠ¨æœºæŠ€æœ¯å&#x8f;‘å±•ç»¼è¿°]</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Marine low speed engine is the first choice for sea-going ship propulsion power, due to economy and reliability.

Many have studied their contribution to emission reduction and impacts on the shipping industry without considering their interactions. This study analyzes how a change in one policy or measure affect the others using a system pulse model. The results suggest that the factors influencing shipping emissions are inter-dependent, and the developed systematic shipping emission model fluctuates periodically. We find that slow steaming is actually not effective in emission reduction in the long-run as it impacts the implementation of other policies. It poses a high demand for the adoption of the EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index) policy so as to promote the application of advanced technologies in the shipbuilding process. It also suggests that although the implementation of the EEDI policy can promote the adoption of the EEOI (Energy Efficiency Operating Index) policy, the EEOI policy actually relieves the demand for the EEDI policy.

While the storage energy density of this energy vector is a key challenge that makes way to a variety of different solutions, from fossil fuel reformers to sodium borohydride systems, fuel cell systems are generally considered among the future ideal energy converters. Nevertheless very few fuel cell marine applications are available worldwide, none of them is related to a ship application, mainly because of the high power requirements. Fuel cells are relatively new in the shipping sector, up to now no civil industrial system has been commercialized yet while military applications rely only on the U212 submarine of the Italian and German Navy. The lack of favorable niche markets coupled with the strong conservative and traditional design principles held back the investment for optimized marine systems. For this reason, present and past projects made use of conveniently adapted automotive technologies into pilot demos, with particular focus on Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC). However, ships requirements are largely different from automotive ones, not only for the power size that are in the range of MWs instead of kWs. On the other side, in order to take advantage of large scale production as well as of the modularity of fuel cell technology, the integrations of automotive or stationary based fuel cell subsystems, already available on the market, inside a dedicate modular marine system seems to be the solution pursued by many shipbuilders and contemplated by regulatory authorities. In hybrid system configurations, fuel cells are considered in combinations with batteries, another important technology under development, in order to take advantage of the superior energy performances of fuel cell systems and the highly power discharge dynamics of batteries. The need of fuel cell power systems for ships is pushing towards the creation of knowledge that requires laboratories able to challenge the abovementioned issues in order to give answers to shipbuilders and at a lower level also to rule makers.

The European Union proposed an even farther reaching transformation: the European Commission adopted a set of proposals to make the EUâ€™s transport policies fit for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Therefore, all industrial actions in line and consistent with these strategies are essential. One of such activities may be a gradual transition from the most common independent controls of transport shipsâ€™ thrusters, propellers, and rudders to an integrated, power optimized, 3 degrees of freedom joystick control. In this paper, the full mission bridge simulator (FMBS) research on potential energy savings and, consequently, a GHG emission reduction, while steering a RoPax twin-screw ferry equipped with bow thrusters by a joystick control, is presented. The task of navigators engaged in the research was to steer the vessel either via classic engine, rudder, and thruster levers or via a joystick while (1) following the predefined straight track, (2) rotating at the turning area, and (3), finally, crabbing (moving sideways) until stopping at the quay fenders. The conclusions are that energy savings of approximately 10% can be expected for berthing manoeuvres controlled by a joystick, compared to independent actuatorsâ€™ controls. These conclusions have been drawn from a statistical analysis of the shipâ€™s energy consumption during typical manoeuvring phases of 18 berthing operations performed in FMBS. Â© 2021 by the authors.

The emission of noxious substances from combustion of marine fuels is restricted in respect of the atmosphere protection, International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations and others. The IMO requirements were determined by time of being in force. The first tier started in 2000 year, the second in 2011, the third is being valid from 2016 on USA waters and in some chosen port areas (from 2021 will be obligatory on Baltic Sea, North Sea and English Channel) and it is a necessity to comply those last requirements. In case of NOx- between the first and second tier the emission was limited 20\%, while the third step was limited 80\% of the first one. This is a very great challenge, because in nowadays marine diesel engines and marine heavy and diesel oils generally applied, it would seem impossible comply those requirements. It was formed environmental controlled areas of NOx emission (ECA) and they will extend. Governments of some countries (USA, Norway) were introduced on own territorial waters the requirements of NOx and SOx emission. In case of exceeding the limits (or a lack of the proper certificates) it was imposed an ecological charge (a form of tax) or the interdict of entrance on regulated water zones. In the paper it was given an attention to the new challenges for engine producers and ship-owners of fulfilling tier 3 standards or search new substitute solutions. The applying solutions for nitrogen oxides emission limitations cause the decreasing of engine efficiency and increasing the fuel consumption (and carbon dioxide emission) up to ten percent. Due to regulations of marine environment protection they generate additional investment and operation cost for ship-owners and charterers.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210744</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The cable guys</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Cabling systems specialist Nexans has introduced an innovative hybrid MV (medium-voltage) ship-to-shore connection cable that helps ships berthed in port to cut their engines and plug in to the local power grid and providing an integral data and telecommunication link.

Yet they are not only excluded from the Kyoto agreement and all current carbon pricing schemes, but do not even pay fuel excises of the type standard for other transport activities. Moreover, each sector benefits from preferential tax treatment - failure to charge VAT on international aviation, and the application of tonnage tax regimes rather than the normal corporate tax in maritime. This paper considers the design of fuel charges in these sectors to address these distortions, and quantifies their impact on emissions, revenue and welfare - showing, amongst other things, that the gain from offsetting the pre-existing tax distortions may be as significant as those from reducing emissions. It shows, too, how compensation schemes can be designed to protect the poorest countries - a key ingredient in the politics of the issue, given the practical need for wide applicability of such charges. The real challenge is to amass the degree of international cooperation required (especially strong for maritime), failure of which to some degree explains their current under-taxation - and, unsurprisingly, to decide who gets the money. Technically, these charges should, if anything, be rather easy to implement.

Finally, an experimental platform for temperature differential power generation was established to assess the impact of influencing agents on the efficiency of temperature differential power generation. The results show that the effect of different thermally conductive greases on the efficiency of temperature differential power generation tablets is basically the same. In addition, the rate of flow of cooling water, the cooling plate area, and the heat source temperature have more significant effects on the open-circuit voltage and maximum output power. The results show that the maximum power output growth rate increases with increasing cooling water flow, reaching 8.26\% at 4 L/min. Likewise, increasing the heat source temperature enhances the maximum output power growth rate by 15.25\% at 220 degrees C. Conversely, the maximum output power of the temperature difference power generation device decreases as the cooling plate area increases, and the maximum output power reduction rate is 15.25\% when the cooling plate area is 80 x 200 mm(2) compared to the case of using a cooling plate area of 80 x 80 mm(2). Moreover, the maximum output power of the temperature differential power generation device reaches 13.6 W under optimal conditions. Assuming that the temperature difference power generation plate is evenly distributed on the tailpipe of the 6260ZCD marine booster diesel engine, it could save approximately 5.44 kW center dot h electric power per hour and achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions of 0.3435 kg per hour.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/en15113900</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210752</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Ship performances and consumption: Analysis for a RO-RO passenger ship</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The more and more severe international standards, the rising cost of fuel and a growing awareness of the environmental impact of pollutant emissions have led energy efficiency to become a topic of great interest in the marine field.

This need turns out in monitoring and control strategies for energy processes on board. Monitoring information is recorded and stocked in a database, that needs to be analyzed to find out patterns in large data sets. A huge amount of data, from a RO-RO Passenger ship, has been analyzed in order to gain a further insight into ship performances.

In this study, the assessment of fuel consumption and pollutant gas emissions during a container ship operating scenarios was carried out by a hydrodynamic vessel movement model capable of representing the vessel propulsion behavior. The marine engine equipped with turbocharger as well as shafting system and fixed pitch propeller was included in vessel propulsion model by separated sub models connecting the required variables to each other. The propulsion system performance in calm water was well validated by a container ship seakeeping test published in 2003. When sailing encounters heavy weather, the severe ship motion induced by irregular waves bring the thruster very close to water surface, making propeller susceptible to ventilation and causing huge thrust loss. Step modulation strategy of power management system has been employed to save thrust loss and improve fuel efficiency in this study. It manages to save large thrust degeneration and along with benefit of thrust efficiency and emission mitigation, but at the expense of shortened sailing distance.

Both indexes represent the ratio between emissions, in mass of CO2, and the transported cargo quantity per sailed distance. At moment an important debate is focusing on the definition of the 'baseline' values for different ship categories. The collaboration between d'Amico Shipping Company, Registro Italiano Navale and Department of Naval Architecture, Marine Engineering, Electric Engineering of Genoa University provided the framework for a study aimed to evaluate the carbon footprint of the vessels of the D'Amico fleet, the analysis of various aspects of factors effecting the carbon dioxide emissions caused by ships and improvements of fleet energy management techniques.

While short-term measures which focus on improving energy efficiency have been implemented, their impact on carbon intensity trends of international shipping over time has not been quantified. This study quantifies and attributes the contribution of various driving factors to the overall change in carbon intensity of international shipping by ship type. The carbon intensity changes of each ship type are quantitatively linked to the overall carbon intensity target of the IMO. The study results highlight that reductions in carbon intensity at the ship-type and global level have been largely a result of decreases in energy intensity from 2012 to 2018 but reductions became smaller in the later period (2015â€“2018), underscoring the limits to energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, this study highlights the additional insights that can be drawn on the transport mode and freight activity profiles from the joint analysis of demand and supply-side indicators, revealing not only the changes in freight activity and capacity utilization, but also the shifts in capacity miles travelled for different shipping modes.

From the navigational and marine hydro-dynamical point of view, the accurate calculation or at least reliable estimation of attainable ship speed at actual sea is essential both from economic and environmental aspects. Reliable ship speed loss estimation under real environmental conditions allows a more accurate prediction of the power increase and fuel consumption as well as gas emissions from ships. On the other hand, technological enhancements like improved hull designs as well as improvement in power and propulsion systems could potentially reduce CO2 emission up to 35\%. These measures could effectively be combined with several other operational measures, such as optimal weather routing and voyage planning for ships, in order to ensure that fuel consumption and CO2 emissions from ships are minimized on every voyage. An appropriate strategy for greener shipping based on aforementioned approaches is proposed in this paper.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210777</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Techno-economic assessment of CO2 liquefaction for ship transportation</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a key technology for addressing global warming by capturing carbon dioxide and storing it somewhere, usually underground. The transportation of CO2 is required since storage sites are not necessarily present near the source sites. Ships can be used for long distance transport of CO2. However, CO2 sources are not always located near the coast; hence onshore transportation may be required in addition to ship for transportation of CO2 from source sites to storage site. Liquefaction is a vital component in ship transportation. In this study, a state-of-the-art CO2 liquefaction processes have been designed by taking CO2 capture facilities into account. The proposed processes require lower liquefaction energy compared to other processes found in the literature. Suitable thermodynamic conditions are required for economical transport of CO2. Therefore, three scenarios each for post-combustion and pre-combustion have been studied in order to explore the effect of thermodynamic conditions on the economics of CO2 transport. The considered scenarios are categorized on the basis of liquefaction plant location as: (i) the capture site, liquefaction plant and shipping terminal are located close to each other; (ii) the capture site and liquefaction plant are far from shipping terminal; (iii) the capture site is far from liquefaction plant and shipping terminal. The scenarios results were useful for deciding the optimum liquefaction plant location. Finally, an economic analysis is performed in order to evaluate the feasibility of CO2 transport from source sites to ship loading terminal.

However, it is still not clear how the joint impact of these two polices will influence vessels' shipping and energy consumption plan. The influence could be more complicated at the post-pandemic era of COVID-19 when the vessel's refueling could be risky. This paper develops mathematical model of the vessel's routing and fuel inventory decisions by considering both the SP and ECA. Based on the model, we analyze the optimal decision of a vessel under three different policy conditions, which are non-SP, compulsive utilization of SP at all ports, and optional SP utilization by the vessel. The numerical experiments are conducted based on the information of a vessel delivering cargos along the coastline in China. The results uncover a novel phenomenon that the implementation of the SP might incentive the vessel to travel longer distance outside the ECA for a lower total cost that results in more pollutant emissions. We show that the SP policy would influence the vessel's fuel management and refueling times which can change the route of vessel sailing inside and outside ECAs. Sensitivity analysis also shed light on how the government's decision on the SP policy may influence the overall pollutant emissions of the vessel from both berthing at ports and sailing on the sea. We discussed how the fixed cost of refueling, which is affected by the risk of the COVID-19 condition, will influence the vessel's plan under the SP and ECA polices. This study suggests the government to make an integrated policy of both SP and ECA at the post-pandemic era to achieve an overall reduction of the pollutant emission.

Since 2017, IMO has been proposing policies to rapidly promote the adoption of cleaner technologies and fuels for oceangoing vessels. Lithium-ion batteries have been recently installed onboard smaller scale ferries and passenger vessels either as the primary energy source, or then as a hybrid solution. Various lithium-ion battery chemistries are available, with sources pointing at lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide as the most feasible solution for ships. In this Chapter (Section 5.2), the authors focus their attention on the design, modeling, and control of maritime batteries, presenting and discussing real-life applications on sizing, modeling and control. Thermal energy storage (TES) technologies are focused on mismatching the gap between the energy production and consumption by recovering surplus energy during the generation to be used on periods of high demand. Although large amount of studies cover the application of TES technology in fields like renewable energies or industrial applications, very few authors evaluated the use of TES systems in ships to increase the efficiency of the engines and reduce their CO2 emissions. In Section 5.3, an analysis of the potential use of TES systems is presented, considering the heat and cold sources in different types of ships, and its use on board. Potential drawbacks of the use of TES on board ships, such as the integration with existing propulsion layouts, the requirements of weight and volume, are also discussed. Â© 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Yet, despite the gloom, recession may be the catalyst that leads shipping to grasp the exasperation and turn itself green. One of the main drivers of climate change is the aviation industry, while the maritime industry had cruised under the radar of scrutiny for many years - until recently. It seems ironic that as the world reaches its peak oil production before fossil fuel options begin to decline, the shipping industry will have to pay more in choosing cleaner fuels just for the chance to struggle with other demand sources for the chance to purchase more expensive fuel. According to one of the world's leading shipping companies, APL, shipyards can build ships designed for greater efficiency and put in engines, which burn fuel more efficiently and pollute less. However, APL failed to take the initiative to do so. While the IMO continues to consider and go on over potential solutions to CO2 and shipowners fret over higher fuel costs, it is worth pointing out that those solutions already exist, indeed some have been around for many years. There are technologies that are also now available, ready to be employed immediately, and with proven results. These include DK Group's Air Cavity System, wind power, fuel additives, twin propellers, new propeller blades, recovering the waste gas heat. All of which can reduce emissions by up 30% in the container trade and 50% in tankers and bulk trade.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210797</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Natural gas as a marine propulsion fuel Energy and environmental benefits in urban ferry service</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Although transportation has major energy and environmental policy implications, not all sectors are treated equally, and ships often are overlooked. However, ships are a significant source of air pollution and account for a nontrivial portion of U.S. petroleum demand. Moderate emissions standards for new marine engines have been proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, but these will take well over a decade to become effective once they are enacted, and there are no energy policy provisions for ships. Nonetheless, ships offer cost-effective options for both emissions reductions and the use of alternative fuels. Aware of these issues, the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Transportation Technologies and the Gas Research Institute sponsored a study of the potential use of natural gas as the fuel for passenger ferries as part of their Natural Gas Vehicle Technology Initiative. The results of the study are discussed, with a focus on the energy and environmental issues related to maritime operations in the United States. The challenges and opportunities of a specific project to design, construct, and operate several natural gas-powered ferries in Boston Harbor are discussed. A significant reduction in air pollution and a large increase in the use of natural gas as a transportation fuel are expected from this project, but the greenhouse gas emission impacts are ambiguous. Further, an emissions monitoring and analysis program is described that would greatly improve the accuracy of maritime emissions inventories and would enable ships to take part in existing emissions trading programs in port cities around the country. Such a development would create significant economic incentives to encourage ferry owners to invest in clean fuel technologies, which could have major implications for energy and environmental policy.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3141/1738-09</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210808</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Knowledge Base Construction of Ship Energy Efficiency Accounting for Various Environmental Factors Based on Big Data Analysis</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Nowadays, energy saving and emission reduction have aroused widespread concern in the maritime industry. Energy efficiency optimization is one of the effective ways to save energy and reduce emissions. Ship energy efficiency is synthetically influenced by multiple factors including environmental and operational profile. The randomness of these factors results in very complex interrelation among the environment and ship engine speed as well as ship energy efficiency. It is difficult for the semi-empirical or theoretical modeling methods to describe such interrelation accurately. The rapid development of big data analysis makes it possible to obtain the association rules of various environmental factors and ship energy efficiency as well as engine speed. In this paper, big data analyses in terms of Parallel Distributed K-Means Clustering (PDKC) algorithm and Parallel Frequent Pattern Mining (PFPM) algorithm are adopted to achieve the clustering analysis of ship energy efficiency related data, and to obtain the interrelation among ship energy efficiency and environmental factors as well as engine speed. On this basis, the knowledge base of ship energy efficiency accounting for various environmental factors is established. The constructed knowledge base can be used for exploring optimization methods of ship energy efficiency, promoting decision-making system development and contributing to energy saving and emission reduction of ships.

These ships, when docked at the ports, consume hotel power produced by the same generators resulting in air pollution. Shutting off these on-board generators and supplying vessel hotel power from the shore can reduce the diesel fuel emissions. This process, when shore power is provided to the vessel auxiliaries by shutting down its on-board generators, is called cold ironing. This technology has been used by the military at naval bases for many decades when ships are docked for long periods. However, recently, as the world's vessel fleet is increasing at a steady pace, vessel calls at specific ports are becoming relatively more frequent In addition, vessel hotel power requirements have increased, and thus the concern of on-board generator emissions during docking periods has become an important air pollution issue. This paper describes electrical power system of a cold ironing project in which barge is used to mount a unit substation and cable management equipment. At present there are no industry standards for cold ironing power system design, especially the grounding of the floating ungrounded ship power supply system. This paper systems, highlights the mainfeatures of cold ironing power with emphasis on personnel and equipment protection by an adequate electrical grounding system.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210824</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Ship Speed Optimization Considering Ocean Currents to Enhance Environmental Sustainability in Maritime Shipping</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Enhancing environmental sustainability in maritime shipping has emerged as an important topic for both firms in shipping-related industries and policy makers. Speed optimization has been proven to be one of the most effective operational measures to achieve this goal, as fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a ship are very sensitive to its sailing speed. Existing research on ship speed optimization does not differentiate speed through water (STW) from speed over ground (SOG) when formulating the fuel consumption function and the sailing time function. Aiming to fill this research gap, we propose a speed optimization model for a fixed ship route to minimize the total fuel consumption over the whole voyage, in which the influence of ocean currents is taken into account. As the difference between STW and SOG is mainly due to ocean currents, the proposed model is capable of distinguishing STW from SOG. Thus, in the proposed model, the ship's fuel consumption and sailing time can be determined with the correct speed. A case study on a real voyage for an oil products tanker shows that: (a) the average relative error between the estimated SOG and the measured SOG can be reduced from 4.75\% to 1.36\% across sailing segments, if the influence of ocean currents is taken into account, and (b) the proposed model can enable the selected oil products tanker to save 2.20\% of bunker fuel and reduce 26.12 MT of CO2 emissions for a 280-h voyage. The proposed model can be used as a practical and robust decision support tool for voyage planners/managers to reduce the fuel consumption and GHG emissions of a ship.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/su12093649</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210834</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Feasibility assessment of a container ship applying ammonia cracker-integrated solid oxide fuel cell technology</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The maritime industry has entered its pathway of decarbonization.

In this study, the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) tool is used to develop various maritime transport scenarios (2016â€“2040) based on possible interventions. Domestic maritime transport used approximately 79 million litres of fuel in 2016 out of which 77% was marine diesel oil while the remaining was premix. The total emissions from maritime transport in 2016 was estimated to be 214 Gg of CO 2 e. At 2% annual growth rate in maritime passenger and freight activity, the total annual fuel consumption will increase to 127 million litres by 2040 with corresponding GHG emissions of 342 Gg of CO 2 e under the BAU scenario.

Speed reduction reduces fuel consumption of ships significantly. In order to perform efficient ship operation, energy demand throughout the whole engine room has to be decreased. The goal of the study is to minimize electrical power consumption during slow steaming operation, hence equivalent fuel consumption and emissions could be decreased. A computational study was carried out in order to clarify potential savings with respect to main engine load. The study quantifies the energy savings in main engine cooling system which has significant potential to reduce electrical power consumption in slow steaming operations. Operational requirements are determined with the help of realistic engine room simulator of a container ship which has waste heat recovery system. The values, obtained from the simulator were verified using the technical manual of a diesel engine, which have similar output power range. The results of calculations show that there is great potential to improve energy efficiency when variable pumps are used. Based on the results, from the main engine cooling system, 60% of electrical power demand reduction can be achieved. The power reduction saved by pumps, decreases considerable amount of marine diesel oil consumption as 296.2 tons where 367.4 tons of fuel needed by diesel generators or oil fired boiler. The reduction in fuel consumption is 80% that the saving in the central cooling system corresponds 948 tons of CO 2 emission reduction and $207,300 cost saving.

This goal was attempted to be achieved by a lifecycle comparative analysis of the viability of three zero-carbon fuels, ammonia, hydrogen, and inland electricity, based on the operational practicality as well as Well-to-Wake environmental impacts. Credible business scenarios were designed with a high-level screening of 27 short-route ferries currently engaged in 26 West-Scotland coastal routes. Then a series of comparative analyses between the diesel and the proposed alternative fuel sources was conducted. While carbon-free fuels are in the early stages of development in the UK, there are various views on how these fuels can be produced, distributed, and used onboard for the clean shipping economy. To determine the optimal energy solutions, all credible scenarios for the upstream pathways for these fuels were developed, based on the current and future prospected UK energy infrastructure and grids. Those scenarios were examined for West-Scotland shipping and extended to the UK targets. Their technical aspects for maritime application were also investigated in consideration of safety, regulation, infrastructural availability, supply chain constraints, barriers, and the downstream emission pathways to their uptake onboard. Ship conceptual designs were briefly conducted to evaluate the systems, technologies, and equipment required for onboard installation to utilise zero-carbon fuels. As a result of the study, when hydrogen was used as a fuel in fuel cells and electricity was supplied as a backup from batteries that store inland power and the solar PV system, GHG emissions were 25.7% of the conventional fossil fuel-using scenario. In addition, it was confirmed that GWP was 22.2% compared to MGO when ammonia was used as fuel without reforming into hydrogen and backup power was supplied from batteries and the solar PV system. It is believed that the analysis results can distinctively demonstrate the adequacy or the inadequacy of current maritime policies for decarbonising shipping. This research finally provides potential solutions for future UK maritime environmental protection and for enhancing the competitiveness of ship owners. In addition, this research concept can serve as a sample that suggests the direction of ideal research for future energy solutions in the marine sector.

This article will give an insight into the range of alternative energy sources and various possible alternative solutions for ship propulsion. Some of these projects will enter commercial operation in late 2014. A new generation of ships is a technical concept that is highly advanced and very practical for the environment in the near future. This article will also present the amount of fuel savings and CO2 emission reduction compared to conventional ships, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of different solutions for ship propulsion. In the next few years, we can expect a further major investment in the development of vessels with greater fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emission by 30\%. That is very useful information that must be taken into account, as the fuel prices on the world market are growing, and requirements for the allowable amount of exhausted CO2 in the atmosphere are becoming more stringent.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210859</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Assessment of potentially cutting GHG emissions from shipping in relation to energy consumption trends using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Maritime shipping is one of the most important activities of the global economy, with outstanding advantages in terms of volume and distance. According to projections by the International Transport Forum, Global demand for marine transportation is expected to grow dramatically over the next three decades. Along with that, maritime activities emit large amounts of greenhouse gases and other harmful emissions, causing negative impacts on the environment. Energy consumption trends (ECT) are formed by the application of potential emission reduction solutions such as technical improvement, use of alternative fuels, efficient and economical use of fuel and optimal vessel operation. However, ECT is, an issue related to various criteria to be assessed. The goal of this study is to make science assessment of ECT which can be developed national ship emission reduction strategy. Availability of energy supply and use, emission reduction potential, economic efficiency were simultaneously considered to evaluating ECT to cut GHG emission from shipping by using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process combined with opinions of 46 experts. The results show that hydrogen fuel ranks highest in ECT as the future fuel of the maritime industry. The findings of this study are expected as an important platform to develop national ship emission reduction strategy planning.

This study evaluates greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction alternatives and their combined ability to decarbonise international transport. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is becoming widely used, reducing CO2 emissions by 20-30 percent, while it has similar action in other emissions such as SOX. Although costs are attractive, methane slip, which depends on the engine type, reduces GHG gains. Replacing conventional fuels such as heavy fuel oil and marine diesel oil with alternative ones is an effective method to decrease SOx emissions. Liquefied natural gas is highly appreciated as an alternative fuel for maritime transportation. In this frame, the possibility of using alternative fuels, such as LNG, to reduce NOx, CO2 and SOx emissions in Heraklion Port, including certain regionally defined waters, over the life of the vessel will also be explored. The study is conducted for ships calling at Heraklion Port and using alternative fuel such as LNG in different modes (cruising, hotelling, manoeuvring). A fuel-based emission reduction factor, rE(if), is defined in relation to the comparison of two different fuels: conventional (heavy oil, marine diesel) and alternative fuels (LNG). The bottom-up method is used for this data analysis. This study, by defining the reduction of several emissions with the use of LNG, indicates that it is actually an efficient transitional fuel to lead international transport to decarbonisation.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/su142416364</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210869</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Feasibility of the Zero-V: A zero-emissions hydrogen fuel-cell coastal research vessel</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">A study is presented to determine the technical, regulatory, and economic feasibility of a coastal research vessel (named the â€œZero-Vâ€&#x9d;) powered solely by hydrogen fuel cells. Feasibility is examined in the context of science mission profiles of particular significance in coastal oceanography that require a modern, capable, general-purpose coastal research vessel. These missions translate into the primary Zero-V vessel requirements against which technical feasibility is assessed. Hull form analysis indicated a trimaran design enables a vessel that can meet all of the space and volume requirements as well as for fitment of the machinery, service, and control spaces necessary for operation of the vessel. To meet speed and range (endurance) requirements, the vessel needs to be constructed of aluminum to reduce weight. The beam (56 feet), length (170 feet) and draft (12 feet) of the vessel enable it to dock at all primary ports of call. With 1800 kW of installed proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel-cell power for primary propulsion, the cruising speed is 10 knots. With 10,900 kg of consumable LH2 stored in two LH2 tanks, the range of the vessel is 2400 nautical miles, with an endurance of 15 days. Both the greenhouse gas (GHG) and criteria pollutant (NOx, HC, PM10) emissions were estimated based on a complete â€œwell-to-wavesâ€&#x9d; (WTW) analysis. Using renewable hydrogen, the annual WTW GHG emissions predicted for the Zero-V are 91.4% less than those from an equivalent vessel running on conventional diesel fuel. Analysis of the WTW criteria pollutant emissions show that hydrogen PEM fuel-cell technology can reduce these emissions below stringent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Tier 4 marine diesel engine emissions limits regardless of whether the hydrogen is made using natural gas or renewable methods. The capital construction cost is estimated to be ~ $79 M, not unreasonable when compared to other modern diesel-fueled research vessels of similar size and capabilities. The operations and maintenance (O&amp;amp;M) costs of the Zero-V were estimated to be 7.7% higher than operating the equivalent diesel-fueled vessel at the assumed fuel prices for LH2 made from steam reforming of fossil natural gas. The approach to safety for the Zero-V is described in terms of the arrangement of hazardous areas on the vessel. Regulatory review of the vessel design by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and the Class society DNV GL found no fundamental or â€œshow-stoppingâ€&#x9d; design concerns that would prevent eventual deployment of the Zero-V. Overall, this study found it feasible from technical, regulatory, and economic perspectives to design, build and operate a coastal research vessel powered solely by hydrogen fuel cells.

This concept proposes a serial integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and a natural gas engine, while anode-off gas (gas at the fuel cell exhaust) is used in the natural gas engine. This study focusses on SOFC-gas engine integration by experimentally analyzing the effects of adding hydrogen, which is the main combustible component of the fuel cell anode-off gas, in marine natural gas engines. The overall challenge is to employ the anode-off gas to improve the performance of marine natural gas engines. To study the effects of anode-off gas combustion in natural gas engines, experiments with hydrogen addition in a marine natural gas engine of 500 kW rated power were performed. Natural gas was replaced with 10 \% and 20 \% of hydrogen, by volume, without any penalties in terms of output power. We found that the high combustion rate of hydrogen improved combustion stability, which allowed for better air-excess ratio control. Thus allowing leaning to higher air-excess ratios and extending the, otherwise, limited operating window Hydrogen addition also improved brake thermal efficiency by 1.2 \%, while keeping NOx emissions below the maritime emission regulations. The improvement in engine efficiency with a larger operating window may help improve the load-taking capabilities of marine natural gas engines.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210874</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Understanding and optimizing vessel propulsive power and fuel use using duty cycle analysis computations</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The maritime industry is in a mindset to save fuel and reduce emissions. How one achieves this end, however, can be a matter of some debate. While substantial industry effort is being placed on things that can be optimized, to achieve real benefit and financial return one must first understand the details about how the vessel consumes propulsive energy during its mission. This paper discusses a rational, simple, and effective systems engineering approach to identify power and fuel demands via computational propulsion analysis of the individual operating modes of a vesselâ€™s duty cycle. It explains sensible consumption metrics that can be used to evaluate and compare different physical systems, strategic plans, or helm decisions. A duty cycle operating mode analysis calculation for a tugboat in multi-role service (as a harbor tug and in long haul ocean barge towing) is demonstrated using COTS software, including examples of design-side and shipboard decision options and consequences.

Battery-powered ship is a solution that can lead to a considerable reduction or even elimination of gaseous emissions, thus limiting fossil fuels consumptions. This paper aims to determine the benefits and drawbacks of marine battery propulsion system by conducting a comparative study using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). It holistic-ally evaluates the performances of the proposed system and the respective conventional one, applied on a 33-meter-long short-route ferry operating on the Thames.

However, emissions from fuel combustion of diesel engine always leave by-products of oxides of nitrogen, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the exhaust gas. Therefore, environmentalists call for cleaner technology to be used in place of conventional diesel engine. The alternative option of diesel-electric engine is an applicable modern technology that generates lower air emissions. The diesel-electric engine for marine vessel offers significantly higher energy efficiency and lower air emissions, compared to the traditional diesel engine. Marine diesel-electric engine is a hybrid engine that uses diesel fuel to generate mechanical torque and transform to electrical power for driving motor and propels the ship. The developed electrical systems, where the diesel engine can be operated on a variable speed giving a huge potential in fuel saving. The Gensets operate in variable speed mode, where the rpm can be adjusted for minimum fuel oil consumption according to the system load. It also allows the integration of energy storage sources like batteries. The energy storage sources reduce the transient loads on the diesel engines. A petroleum company has therefore launched a green logistics program and adopt diesel-electric engine into the marine logistic process to be an initiative of the environmental friendly offshore operation. The Anchor Handling Tug Supply (AHTS) operate in the Gulf of Thailand for supporting offshore petroleum production. Since 2012, more than 50% of AHTS operated by diesel engines have been replaced by diesel-electric engines. By implementation of the green logistics program, in 2013 our marine fleet can decreased up to 7,100 m3 of Marine Gas Oil (MGO) consumption, whilst also reduces totally 22,000 tons of CO2e emission. Divided from overall picture, the replacement power driven of AHTS by diesel-electric engines contributed to the fuel saving at 4,000 m3 of MGO or 56 % of total MGO reduction. In economical perspective, a company has an opportunity to cut off fuel expense for 206 MMTHB or 6.9 MMUSD per annual. This could reflect a company determination to stay at forefront of the industry as the leading petroleum exploration and production company driven by green practices throughout our operation and supply chains.

Some ship-owners have recently adopted or started to consider the adoption of alternative fuels, but systematic studies of this are still lacking. We address this gap by studying how ship-owners differ in both actual and intended adoption of alternative fuels. We analyze data from a unique survey with 281 ship-owners in Norway, a major ship-owning country and center for maritime technology development, with descriptive statistics and analysis of variance. We find early adopters among large and established ship-owners in offshore, international cargo and domestic passenger shipping segments, which are often subjected to specific contractual demands for alternative fuel adoption. Laggards were typically small and young ship-owners operating in shipping segments where demands for alternative fuel adoption are weak. Our findings also suggest that firms' business strategy and financial and knowledge resources may have relevance for ship-owner's adoption of alternative fuels. Our study has implications for national and international policymaking, highlighting for example how contracting mechanisms can be an effective tool in incentivizing the adoption of alternative fuels.

The EU responded by setting targets. The EU 2050 objectives set some intermediate targets for Eco-Efficient Vessel Emission Reduction for key pollutants: CO2: >80% (-30% by 2020), NOx: 100% (-80% by 2020), SOx: 100% (-80% by 2020) and Noise Reduction: -3dB. A review of current research (Ziarati et al, 2018) clearly shows that the targets set for 2020 by both IMO and EU were not achieved and the 2050 goals are also unlikely to be achieved. The Industry is taking steps to reduce its air pollution and carbon footprint due to recent and upcoming IMO and EU regulations; IMO GHG study, Buhang et al (2009) reports that IMO has introduced some limits but has been unable to monitor ship emissions. EMSA has tried the use of satellites and drones to monitor ships, which pollute the sea but has been unable to monitor ship emissions and waste discharge at sea effectively due to technical difficulties and also vastness of the oceans. As the regulations and technologies governing energy efficiency on board ships becomes more complex it is realised by both the IMO and the shipping industry that seafarers need specific training to a much higher level in these fields. There needs to be a position specifically for managing, checking and controlling a shipâ€™s emissions for gases that are harmful to human health and the environment, an "Emissions Manager". As this is a brand new position, there are neither defined competences for this role nor any specific knowledge, understanding or proficiency for it. The paper gives full account of IMO efforts in recent years in setting legislation for key pollutants and reports on a new job specification for the Emissions Manager and proposes that an e-course being developed by several EU member states for the training of key ship officers and crew on how to minimise and monitor harmful emissions. The corresponding programme concerned with the current practice of managing emissions as well as the principle of making ships energy efficient.

However, investments can be hindered by barriers, and drivers are necessary to reduce or overcome them and promote investment. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to analyze what factors influence investment decisions-and how they do so-when there are principal-agent problems in the shipowner-charterer relationship. The methodology is based on the following process: model and hypotheses formulation, variable definition, the creation of a study sample and statistical treatment through a descriptive analysis of variables and a binomial logistic regression model, all based on a state-of-the-art application. The results corroborate the hypotheses and indicate that principal-agent problems and split incentives, especially in time charter contracts, and a lack of verified information make the shipowners less likely to invest. Moreover, energy efficiency measures are less likely to be implemented in older vessels, possibly due to the difficulty associated with recovering the investment; they are more likely in larger and newer vessels, and regulation encourage their adoption. Furthermore, investment is more likely in vessels with verified information and high levels of both activity and harmful emissions. Improved knowledge in this field could help businesses and governments to act in a more sustainable manner, without detriment to an innovative and competitive sector.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.3390/su12197943</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210337</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Model based optimal management of a hybrid propulsion system for leisure boats</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The strict emission standards for port approach and coastal navigation, and the fuel-saving requirements, in the marine sector, are pushing the manufactures to consider more advanced and alternative propulsion systems. In this context, this study deals with the design and management of an innovative hybrid thermal-electric propulsion system. The evaluations are referred to the case study of a leisure boat, which is used for passenger transportation in tourist areas. Experimental tests are carried out on single components, with a particular focus on re-calibration of the thermal engine, for its homologation and optimal use in the proposed hybrid architecture. The identification of proper management strategies is performed on the basis of a boat simulation model, which is set up starting from experimental data and characteristics of components. In this regard, an optimization procedure, based on the use of genetic algorithms, is performed in order to set the parameters of onboard energy management strategies and pursue the double objective of extending battery pack cycling life and reducing exhaust emissions. The obtained simulation results highlight the benefits of the proposed architecture showing sensible improvements in comparison with a traditional ICE based configuration. The methodology proposed in this paper enables reliable evaluations and preliminary optimization of energy management strategies, with a drastic reduction in experimentation time and general costs.

It is closely related to vessel speed and the waterway environment, among other factors. Finding the optimal main engine speed is a basic way to improve energy efficiency and reduce the EEOI. Ships in ice areas are also affected by the impact of ice loads during navigation. It is critical to consider uncertainties when reducing the EEOI of ships in ice areas to achieve energy savings and reduce emissions. In this study, the data mining of ice loads was realized through wavelet decomposition, which proved that it is reasonable to take ice loads into account as random uncertainty random variables. This research introduces uncertainty analysis and optimization theory when considering ice loads and other important stochastic factors. The main engine speed of ships in ice areas was then taken as the design variable. By solving the minimum EEOI optimization model, a robust and reliable speed optimal result was obtained, and the effectiveness and advancement of this method was verified using a comparative example.

Marine fuel cell concepts are a promising new technology, which can offer several technical and operational advantages. This study assesses the competitiveness of marine fuel cell applications operated on Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) relative to diesel generator sets, with focus on economic and environmental performance. With regard to the latter, with a carbon containing fuel such as LNG, fuel cells reduce CO2 emissions by about 30% at maximum continuous rating and even more at partial load levels. NOx and SOx emissions are reduced up to 100%. As to the economics, the current higher investment costs of fuel cells are compensated by lower fuel costs (LNG). The modelled results show that with today's high fuel oil price (2008), an energy efficient technology such as fuel cells, will be economically competitive even with capital expenditures double that of the incumbent technology. CO2 taxation is expected to have less influence on the profitability.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210414</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The IMO initial strategy for reducing Greenhouse Gas(GHG) emissions, and its follow-up actions towards 2050</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">At the 62nd Meeting (2011) of the Marine Environment Protection Committee (henceforth MEPC), the IMO had adopted the proposed amendment adding to the MARPOL Annex Chapter â…¥ making it mandatory the EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index) for new ships as well as the SEEMP (Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan) for all ships. This was eventually for reducing GHG emissions from international shipping vessels, and has been effective since the 1st of January 2013 for ships weighing 400GT. Notably, at the 70th MEPC, the plan to develop a roadmap for the comprehensive IMO strategy on reducing GHGs from ships was approved, and as such, the plans including its short-term, mid-term and long-term measures have been arranged in order to adopt the pertinent strategy by 2023. Following the approved roadmap, at the 72nd MEPC (April, 2018), the first stage of reducing GHG emissions from ships was selected/passed as the Initial IMO strategy for the reduction of GHGs from ships (henceforth Initial IMO GHG Strategy), and at the 73rd MEPC (October, 2018), subsequent programs following the Initial IMO GHG Strategy were arranged.

The Japanese Government has formalized the acceptance of Kyoto Protocol on 4th of June, 2002. Under the Protocol, Japan has an obligation of greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 6% below 1990 levels for the first commitment period of 2008-2012. The Super Eco-Ship Project is conducted by the National Maritime Research Institute of Japan (NMRI) as a national project from April, 2001, controlled by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. The Super Eco-Ship would embody a technical breakthrough in meeting certain requirements of coastal shipping such as reducing the burden on the environment and the logistics costs and improving the living and working conditions on board. Super eco-ship has highly efficient electrical propulsion system featuring the podded propulsor with contra-rotating propeller (CRP). Advanced concept and systems are applied in the research and development of the Super Eco-Ship. Flexibility in the arrangement of main engine and in the hull form design is realized by the electric propulsion system. New design tools based advanced concept and methodology are applied. Hull form design method by means of CFD simulation and CAD are performed to design optimum hull form for electric propulsion system. The high propulsive efficiency due to the combination with the optimum hull design and podded propulsor enables the reduction of CO2 compared with the conventional ship. The podded propulsor with CRP enables drastically good maneuverability and flexible control system in ship operation as well as high propulsive efficiency. A captain or a pilot makes an easy operation during berthing by using the control device of the podded propulsor. Crew members are engaged in various works throughout all the onboard operational phases, i. e., loading/unloading, mooring, berthing, anchoring and navigation. In order to reduce work loads of crew members, labor-saving support systems are designed to help a basically single operator at each work position, such as a navigation bridge, a bow deck, a stern deck and a cargo deck, to execute each assigned mission. Onboard ship works are modeled throughout all the operational phases. A typical navigation scenario is selected that represents various works involved in the navigation. According to the scenario, time series of work contents and crew assignments in a conventional ship are drawn as a basic onboard work model. To minimize the crew members and their work loads, functions of the labor saving support system are decided. Navigation according to the typical scenario by the minimized crew members is simulated and compared with that of the conventional ship.

The company works closely with several major large engine companies, and such work has increased in both volume and importance as rising fuel costs and tighter emission regulations have forced engine designers as well as vessel operators to look towards ever more radical solutions to raising efficiency without compromising cleanliness. The company is exploring advanced technology in the whole power and propulsion system. Advanced computer modeling and simulation technology permits relevant and in-depth research and development into fuel cell and hybrid technology using various techniques, in some cases executed in real time. The company sees considerable potential in radial turbines, bottoming- or organic-Rankine cycles, and split cycle regenerative engine technologies. Other current activities include research into true hybrid technologies for ship propulsion. Battery-based systems are an obvious choice, similar to those used in hybrid road vehicles, but batteries have proved less than ideal in marine applications. They are heavy, bulky, and costly in terms of initial investment and replacement. Fuel reforming has been a significant part of Ricardo's work. Energy recovery and energy storage technologies also have promising applications in the marine sector. However, as with most technologies, existing hybrid propulsion technology is cost effective up to a point, but becomes a very costly option as higher levels of CO2 reduction are demanded. Thus, Ricardo investigated other energy storage technologies. The most promising of which are hydraulics, ultra-capacitors, and flywheels, which all tend to score more highly than electro-chemical solutions - particularly flywheel.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210465</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Decarbonisation of maritime transport - European Union measures as an inspiration for global solutions</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The EU Regulation 2015/757 established a monitoring, reporting and verification (EU MRV) mechanism for CO2 emissions from shipping.

However, the IMO Data Collection System for ship fuel oil consumption data (IMO DCS), established in 2016 and similar to the EU MRV mechanism, has not been perceived as sufficient given the EU's ambitions to achieve swift decarbonisation of maritime transport. The fragmentation of greenhouse gas emission regulation has also consequences for the Port State Control inspections.

In this context, further effort is required for improving the energy efficiency of cruise ship energy systems. In this paper, we propose a generic method for modelling the power plant of an isolated system with mechanical, electric and thermal power demands and for the optimal load allocation of the different components that are able to fulfil the demand. The optimisation problem is presented in the form of a mixed integer linear programming (MINLP) problem, where the number of engines and/or boilers running is represented by the integer variables, while their respective load is represented by the non-integer variables. The individual components are modelled using a combination of first-principle models and polynomial regressions, thus making the system nonlinear. The proposed method is applied to the load-allocation problem of a cruise ship sailing in the Baltic Sea, and used to compare the existing power plant with a hybrid propulsion plant. The results show the benefits brought by using the proposing method, which allow estimating the performance of the hybrid system (for which the load allocation is a non-trivial problem) while also including the contribution of the heat demand. This allows showing that, based on a reference round voyage, up to 3% savings could be achieved by installing the proposed system, compared to the existing one, and that a NPV of 11Â kUSD could be achieved already 5Â years after the installation of the system.

In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that emissions from sea-going vessels can no longer be ignored. There is a growing need for detailed emission inventories to evaluate the impact of this transport mode on air quality and health. In this paper we present MOPSEA, an activity-based emission model to determine emissions from sea-going vessels. The model considers shipping activities of sea-going vessels on Belgian territory, combined with individual vessel characteristics. We apply this model to study the effects of recent international efforts to reduce emissions from sea-going vessels in Belgian territorial waters for the current fleet and for two scenarios up to 2010. The emission model for Belgium, based on different vessel operating areas, reveals that most maritime emissions from the main engines will increase. CO2 emissions will increase by 2-9% over the 2004-2010 period due to an increase in shipping activity. NOX emissions are projected to rise between 1% and 8% because the increase in activity offsets the reductions from the international maritime organisation (IMO) and European regulations. In contrast, SO2 emissions will decrease by at least 50% in 6 years time. The switch of auxiliaries from heavy fuel oil to diesel oil at berth results in a large emission reduction (33%) for PM and small reductions for CO2, NOX, CO and HC (4-5%). The choice between a bottom-up versus top-down approach can have important implications for the allocation of maritime emissions. The MOPSEA bottom-up model allocates only 0.7 Mton CO2 to Belgium, compared to 24.2 Mton CO2 based on bunker fuel inventories. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, industries have been forced to consider investing significantly in supply chains to achieve an efficient distribution of LNG for cost efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. To minimize the contribution of LNG maritime transportation to global climate change, there is a need to quantify the carbon footprints systematically. In this research, we developed a novel and practical model for estimating the carbon footprint for LNG maritime transport. Using the MATLAB program, an uncertainty-based carbon footprint accounting framework is created. The Monte Carlo simulation model is built to conduct a carbon footprint analysis while the main input parameters were changed within a reliable range. Later, a multivariate sensitivity analysis is performed using the Risk Solver software to estimate the most significant parameters on the net carbon footprints. The sensitivity analysis results showed that that steam process day and steaming fuel consumption are found to be the most sensitive parameters for the overall carbon footprint for both Laden and Ballast trips. Furthermore, it was found that the Q-Max vessel produces more carbon emissions when compared to the Q-Flex, although both are traveling the same distance and are using the same fuel type. The type of fuel is also significantly affecting the emission values due to the relevant carbon content in the fuel. Like the case of the two conventional vessels, the one that is running with the only LNG is found to have fewer emissions when compared to the one run with dual-mode.

In 2012 Emission Control Areas (ECA) will limit fuel sulphur content to 1% and from 2015 to 0.1%). NOx emissions based on ships engine speed are also reduced for new vessels (2012 &amp;amp; 2016). Facing this legislation, ship owners have the alternative either to operate ships with costly low-sulphur fuels, or to keep using HFO but together with a gas cleaning equipment at the ship stack in order to reduce the rejected amount of SO2 gas in the atmosphere. To achieve this requirement, research and development organizations came out with proposing a solution that uses a device for cleaning exhaust gas of marine diesel engines. The paper presents a short communication about the DEECON project, which aim is to create a novel on-board after-treatment unit more advanced than any currently available. Each sub-unit of the system will be optimized to remove a specific primary pollutant. In particular, the technology within the DEECON system is based on novel or improved abatement techniques for reducing SOx, NOx, Particulate Matter (PM), CO and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). Some of these technologies are completely new for the maritime sector and they will represent a breakthrough in the reduction of the atmospheric emissions of ships, moving forward the performance of exhaust gas cleaning systems and fostering and anticipating the adoption of future and tighter regulatory requirements. In addition, an after-treatment strategy enables the possible adoption of alternative fuels, which often have their own emissions characteristics.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210633</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Future fuels for dredgers</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">In the last century, the maritime sector has thrived on using Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), the waste of the petrochemical industry, as a fuel, which has been efficiently and at low cost. The increasing focus on harmful emissions (NOx, SOx, PM) and carbon emission reduction leads to the need of using alternative, cleaner fuels. Royal IHC is a front runner on the adoption of cleaner fuels, with a track record on LNG fueled dredging vessels sailing and on order. Although certainly a cleaner option, LNG is still a fossil fuel. In the future, fossil-free alternative fuels will have to be adopted by the maritime sector. The use of alternative fuels is expected to be accelerated by the emission legislation developments, climate agreements (such as the Paris Agreement) and the introduction of future taxing systems, e.g. carbon taxing. This will be added to the total costs in the economic figures. The shift to zero emission dredgers (zero CO2, SOx, NOx and PM emissions) is expected to accelerate as a consequence of societal acceptance and legislation developments. Royal IHC expects that these developments will lead to a shift in the balance towards clean technologies and carbon-neutral fuels. In this paper alternative fuels are compared on availability, feasibility and C02-equivalent impact. Also alternative drive systems are discussed such as electric drives, batteries and fuel cells. The assessment of alternative fuels requires an approach of Total Cost of Ownership, as each fuel has advantages and disadvantages and a trade-off must to be made between prime mover technology, storage and bunkering technology, investment and fuel costs, and exhaust emissions regulations. The paper will discuss some of the most promising carbonneutral energy carriers for the maritime sector: â€¢ Hydrogen â€¢ Ammonia (hydrogen carrier) â€¢ Renewable methanol â€¢ Batteries â€¢ Solar panels (PV) In order to anticipate to these developments, Royal IHC has taken the challenge to design a hydrogen powered hopper dredger. The number of hydrogen fueled road vehicles is increasing and has boosted the hydrogen technology of fuel cells and storage. This technology can be implemented in dredgers. The consequences with regard to vessel design, safety and operations will be discussed. A zero emission hydrogen powered dredger is presented and seems a viable solution.

However, such advance power system architectures tend to face greater challenges in optimal power allocation due to the increased flexibility to split the load among multiple power sources and diversified operations of different vessel types. To address the power management challenges, in this paper, an instantaneous optimization-based approach is proposed for an all-electric hybrid power system, which adopts the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS). First, the dynamic models of the all-electric hybrid power system are formulated in MATLAB\Simulink and validated on a laboratory-scaled hybrid power system testbed. The power management problem is then formulated using ECMS approach, and a multi-level power management framework is proposed to integrate ECMS solution for practical implementation on an all-electric hybrid vessel. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed approach is validated on a full-scale setup identical to an actual all-electric hybrid vessel with dc distribution in MARINTEK, Trondheim, Norway. The performance of ECMS is also benchmarked against an improve rule-based strategy. The experimental results demonstrated that ECMS can achieve a substantial fuel savings of up to 24.4% as compared with improved rule-based strategy over one cycle of harbor tugboat operations, with the presence of available shore charging.

The International Convention on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) was amended in September1997 and the amendment essentially addresses this vital concern by stipulating regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships. The tier II and III amendments, currently under deliberation are likely to be brought into force by 2010 with more stringent emission regulations which shall impose new challenges to the marine engine designers. Air pollution control standards, reduction of emissions through engine re-design techniques being adopted by engine manufacturers, cutting down emissions in existing engines by use of aftermarket retrofits and use of alternative fuels / technologies are discussed. Alternative propulsion methods focused around gas turbines aided by other sustainable green technology that can be harnessed to power ships in the current scenario of global warming and high dependence on fossil fuels with soaring prices are also highlighted.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210792</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Decision support system for multiobjective sustainable marine shipping</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Nowadays it is important to consider sustainable factors in maritime shipping. This is because they are resulting in higher greenhouse effect. One of the factors is fuel emission that may lead to more carbon dioxide emission. In order to reduce fuel emission, one possible way is to optimize vessel speed, but this method may lead to lower service level. Trading off those conflicting relationships is important for planners. Therefore, many existing literatures focus on modelling this problem to be similar to the real world situation and the algorithm that provides the optimal speed within reasonable time. However, in practice, the decision makers also need a decision support system that helps them obtain the optimal speed. Thus, this paper presents a decision support system that seeks to suggest the speed in balancing fuel emission with service level for marine shipping.

In the past few years, environmental and policy reasons dictate the immense reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in industries worldwide. Towards this direction, the shipping industry has focused on ship trim optimization in the last few years as an operational measure for better energy efficiency and thus a way to reduce consumption and energy-related emissions. In this paper, we present a machine learning solution to the problem of trim optimization. Specifically, we use Internet of Things (IoT) data for speed, draft, and trim in order to accurately predict shaft power. After our machine learning model is trained, we use its predicting capabilities to create the shaft power surface as part of the trim monitoring user interface of the maritime company infrastructure.

This tariff-based policy action, whereby vessels in compliance with International Maritime Organisation (IMO) ECA standards pay a lower transit tariff than noncompliant vessels, could be a feasible alternative to petitioning for a Panamanian ECA through the IMO. A $4.06/container fuel tax could incentivize ECA-compliant emissions reductions for nearly two-thirds of Panama Canal container vessels, mainly through fuel switching; if the vessel(s) also operate in IMO-defined ECAs, exhaust-gas treatment technologies may be cost-effective. The RATES model presented here compares current abatement technologies based on hours of operation within an ECA, computing costs for a container vessel to comply with ECA standards in addition to computing the Canal tax that would reduce emissions in Panama. Retrofitted open-loop scrubbers are cost-effective only for vessels operating within an ECA for more than 4500 h annually. Fuel switching is the least-cost option to industry for vessels that operate mostly outside of ECA regions, whereas vessels operating entirely within an ECA region could reduce compliance cost with exhaust-gas treatment technology (scrubbers).
