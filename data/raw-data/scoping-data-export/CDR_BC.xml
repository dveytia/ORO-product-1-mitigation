Despite of the rapidly accumulated biomass, S. apetala does not increase the soil organic carbon (SOC) storage comparing with native mangroves. The belowground biomass of mangrove, especially its fine roots, plays an important role in SOC sequestration. Here, the soil physicochemical properties, vegetation and fine-root biomass and SOC stock were compared between S. apetala (22-year-old) plantation and native mangrove at different stages (20, 40, and 80-year-old) The 22-year-old S. apetala already had a higher vegetation biomass and fine root biomass than the 20-year-old and 40-year-old native mangrove. However, no significant differences in the SOC stock were observed between S. apetala and native mangrove (20-year-old and 40-year-old). The biomass of vegetation and fine root and SOC stock of S. apetala were all significantly lower than that of 80-year-old Rhizophora stylosa. Multiple stepwise regression analysis suggested that lower C:N ratio of fine roots and soil salinity in S. apetala can promote the decomposition rate of fine roots and then offset the carbon accumulation advantage related to higher fine root biomass. Restoration of mangrove was effective to enhance soil carbon stock, but the exotic S. apetala should be decreased or avoided in the future, especially in the Natural Reserve.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.catena.2021.105423</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210104</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The value of carbon sequestration and storage in coastal habitats</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Coastal margin habitats are globally significant in terms of their capacity to sequester and store carbon, but their continuing decline, due to environmental change and human land use decisions, is reducing their capacity to provide this ecosystem service. In this paper the UK is used as a case study area to develop methodologies to quantify and value the ecosystem service of blue carbon sequestration and storage in coastal margin habitats. Changes in UK coastal habitat area between 1900 and 2060 are documented, the long term stocks of carbon stored by these habitats are calculated, and the capacity of these habitats to sequester CO2 is detailed. Changes in value of the carbon sequestration service of coastal habitats are then projected for 2000-2060 under two scenarios, the maintenance of the current state of the habitat and the continuation of current trends of habitat loss. If coastal habitats are maintained at their current extent, their sequestration capacity over the period 2000-2060 is valued to be in the region of 1 pound billion UK sterling (3.5\% discount rate). However, if current trends of habitat loss continue, the capacity of the coastal habitats both to sequester and store CO2 will be significantly reduced, with a reduction in value of around 0.25 pound billion UK sterling (2000-2060; 3.5\% discount rate). If loss-trends due to sea level rise or land reclamation worsen, this loss in value will be greater. This case study provides valuable site specific information, but also highlights global issues regarding the quantification and valuation of carbon sequestration and storage. Whilst our ability to value ecosystem services is improving, considerable uncertainty remains. If such ecosystem valuations are to be incorporated with confidence into national and global policy and legislative frameworks, it is necessary to address this uncertainty. Recommendations to achieve this are outlined. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Seagrass beds in coastal ecosystems have high plant productivity and are found to have the ability to reduce the effect of global warming due to the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. Due to the anthropogenic effect, decreasing environmental quality, such as tourism, may affect seagrass diversity and growth, therefore its carbon contents. This study investigates the ability of seagrass species as carbon storage and their diversity in a common tourist destination area referred to as disturbed habitat, located at Sanur and an area that is less disturbed, referred to as undisturbed habitat. Samples were collected from 3 transects 50m in length that were placed on each site. Three plots, each measuring 0.5 x 0.5 m, were employed on each transect. The number of individuals of each species and the percent plant coverage were measured on each plot. Plant biomass and carbon content were extracted in the Lab and divided into below- and above-ground. The result shows that eight species were found at Sanur and only four from Samuh sites. On average, the percentage of plant coverage was higher at the Samuh site. Samuh site. The plant biomass and carbon storage were lower at Samuh than at the Sanur site. Species differences from each site affect the plant biomass, so the carbon content. Anthropogenic activities are not the only ones to determine the carbon storage of seagrass, but rather the species morphology. Â© 2021.

Exotic H. stipulacea possessed considerable storing capacity, with 2-fold higher Corg stock (0.71 Â± 0.05 kg mâˆ’2 in the top 20 cm of sediment) and burial (14.78 gCorg mâˆ’2 yâˆ’1) than unvegetated areas and C. nodosa meadows and, surprisingly, comparable to P. oceanica.

Corg and N stocks were higher in exotic than native H. stipulacea populations. Based on isotopic mixing model, organic material trapped in H. stipulacea sediments was mostly allochthonous (seagrass detritus 17% vs seston 67%).

Here we assessed how superficial sedimentary OC and TN within intertidal vegetated assemblages (saltmarsh and seagrass) vary along a flow gradient, which is a major driver of sediment grain size, and thus of organic matter (OM) content. A significant relationship between flow current velocity and OC and TN stocks in the seagrass was found, but not in the saltmarsh. OC and TN stocks of the saltmarsh were larger than the seagrass, even though that habitat experiences shorter hydroperiods. Mixing models revealed that OM sources also varied along the flow gradient within the seagrass, but not in the saltmarsh, showing increasing contributions of microphytobenthos (17â€“32%) and decreasing contributions of POM (45â€“35%). As well, OM sources varied vertically as microphytobenthos contribution was highest at the higher intertidal saltmarsh (48%), but not POM (39%). Macroalgae, seagrass and saltmarsh showed low contributions. Local trade-offs between flow current velocities, hydroperiod and structural complexity of vegetation must be considered, at both horizontal and vertical (elevation) spatial dimensions, for better estimates of blue carbon and nitrogen in coastal ecosystems.

We tested agricultural- and forest-based methods for estimating the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f APAR), a key parameter for modelling gross primary productivity (GPP), in a restored, managed wetland with a dense litter layer of non-photosynthetic vegetation, and we compared the difference in canopy light transmission between a tidally influenced wetland and the managed wetland. The presence of litter reduced correlations between spectral vegetation indices and f APAR. In the managed wetland, a two-band vegetation index incorporating simulated World View-2 or Hyperion green and near-infrared bands, collected with a field spectroradiometer, significantly correlated with f APAR only when measured above the litter layer, not at the ground where measurements typically occur. Measures of GPP in these systems are difficult to capture via remote sensing, and require an investment of sampling effort, practical methods for measuring green leaf area and accounting for background effects of litter and water.

However, it is unclear whether the dynamics of labile organic carbon (LOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) are coupled and how they influence each other in coastal wetland. The present work investigated the trends of soil carbon fractions among mangrove and Spartina alterniflora communities with different stand ages (1, 5, 10, and 15 years), at Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve, China. We found that SOC in a mangrove ecosystem increased over time, while there was no significant trend in S. alterniflora dominated ecosystems. The highest LOC of mangrove appeared in 5-year-old communities, and then decreased with stand age. In S. alterniflora communities, content of labile fractions increased with the stand age. These trends indicated different soil carbon dynamics when comparing mangrove and S. alterniflora ecosystems. The development of mangroves promoted accumulation of recalcitrant carbon, while S. alterniflora ecosystems contributed to an increase of labile carbon. This phenomenon is probably caused by the characteristics of vegetation and the hydrological conditions. Mangroves contribute more refractory organic carbon to the soil carbon pool, while accumulation of LOC in S. alterniflora communities may inhibit the stabilization of SOC. Our study on the relationship of LOC and SOC implies that complex interactions occur among soil carbon pools and environmental conditions in coastal wetlands, suggesting soil carbon models should take into account decoupled dynamics of LOC and SOC.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107875</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210278</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Species Diversity, Biomass and Carbon Stock Assessment of Kanhlyashay Natural Mangrove Forest</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Mangrove ecosystems sequester and store large amounts of carbon in both biomass and soil. In this study, species diversity, the above and below-ground biomass as well as carbon stock by the mangroves in Kanhlyashay natural mangrove forest were estimated. Six true mangrove species from four families were recorded in the sample plots of the study area. Among them, Avicennia officinalis L. from the Acanthaceae family was the abundance of species with an importance value of 218.69%. Shannonâ€“Wienerâ€™s diversity index value (Hâ€² = 0.71) of the mangrove community was very low compared to other natural mangrove forests since the mangrove stands in the study site possessed a low number of mangrove species and were dominated by a few species. Estimated mean biomass was 335.55 Â± 181.41 Mg haâˆ’1 (AGB = 241.37 Â± 132.73 Mg haâˆ’1, BGB = 94.17 Â± 48.73 Mg haâˆ’1). The mean overall C-stock of the mangrove stand was 150.25 Â± 81.35 Mg C haâˆ’1 and is equivalent to 551.10 Â± 298.64 Mg CO2 eq. The role of forests in climate change is two-fold as a cause and a solution for greenhouse gas emissions. The result of the study demonstrated that the mangroves in Letkhutkon village have high carbon storage potential, therefore it is necessary to be sustainably managed to maintain and increase carbon storage. Climate change mitigation may be achieved not only by reducing the carbon emission levels but also by maintaining the mangrove ecosystem services as carbon sinks and sequestration.

Based on the reported bulk density and total organic carbon content, we estimated the carbon sequestration rate of major lakes and swamps regions in China. The carbon sequestration capacity of lakes of the whole country was 1981.87GgC Â· a-1. Lakes in East China exhibited the highest carbon sequestration rate and the greatest carbon sequestration capacity. Swamps demonstrated a total higher carbon sequestration of 4.9lTgC, 1.47 times greater than that of lakes in China. Among the five varieties of swamps, mangrove had the highest carbon sequestration rate of 444.27 gC Â· m-2Â· a-1, while the inland marsh was of the greatest carbon sequestration capacity, the amount was 1501.12 GgC a-1. Wetlands reclamation led to huge amount of carbon emission, and the carbon loss due to reclamation of lakes and swamps were 0.82 and 26.9Tg, respectively. After the great flood in 1998, wetlands recovery policies such as returning farms to lakes and swamps were implemented. The carbon sequestration potential of wetlands recovery was 30.48GgC Â·a-1, including 30.26GgC Â· a-1 from returning farms to lakes and 0.22GgC Â· a-1 from returning farms to swamps. Under the ongoing National Wetland Conservation Action Plan, the carbon sequestration potential of wetland restoration was estimated at 6.57GgC Â· a-1. Accordingly, wetland protection and restoration can improve the carbon sequestration potential of wetlands.</style></abstract><urls/></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210305</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Effects of short-term invasion of Spartina alterniflora and the subsequent restoration of native mangroves on the soil organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus stock</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The exotic cordgrass Spartina alterniflora has severely invaded the mangrove wetlands in southern China and ecological restoration using native mangroves was conducted in an attempt to control this invasive species. In this study, the contents and pools of soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were quantified to investigate the invasive effects of S. alterniflora and then to evaluate whether the ecological restoration of native mangrove could reverse those effects. S. alterniflora only showed significantly higher organic carbon content in the surface 0â€“10 cm of soil than in the uninvaded mudflat. The high Î´13C values in the surface soil of the invaded habitat demonstrated that S. alterniflora contributed 42.6â€“62.2% of the organic carbon. The SOC for invasive S. alterniflora and newly restored mangroves (4 years and 14 years) was not enhanced in comparison to the unvegetated mudflat. S. alterniflora significantly increased the surface soil TN content, but decreased the available phosphorus content and TP density. The TN densities increased gradually with the mangrove restoration, while the TP densities were only slightly influenced. The results suggested that short-term invasion of S. alterniflora and subsequent mangrove restoration did not alter SOC or TN pool sizes, but S. alterniflora was shown to affect the potential carbon storage capacity produced by the mangroves in the Zhangjiang Estuary.

However, greenhouse gas (GHG) losses can offset the climatic benefits gained from C storage depending on how these tidal marshes are constructed and managed. This study attempts to determine the GHG emissions from a 4â€“6Â year old created brackish marsh, what environmental factors governed these emissions, and how the magnitude of the fluxes relates to other wetland ecosystems. The static flux chamber method was used to measure GHG fluxes across three distinct plant zones segregated by elevation. The major of soil GHG fluxes from the marsh were from CO2 (âˆ’48â€“192 mgÂ C m-2 h-1), although it was near the lower end of values reported from other wetland types having lower salinities, and would mostly be offset by photosynthetic uptake in this created brackish marsh. Methane flux was also low (âˆ’0.33â€“0.86 mgÂ C m-2 h-1), likely inhibited by the high soil SO4 2âˆ’ and soil redox potentials poised above âˆ’150Â mV in this in this created brackish marsh environment. Low N2O flux (âˆ’0.11â€“0.10 mgÂ N m-2 h-1) was due to low soil NO3 âˆ’ and soil redox conditions favoring complete denitrification. GHG fluxes from this created brackish marsh were generally lower than those recorded from natural marshes, suggesting that C sequestration may not be offset by the radiative forcing from soil GHG emissions if projects are designed properly.

BC can influence soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization through priming effects. Positive, negative or no priming effects on C mineralization has been observed following BC additions to soils. However, uncertainty still remains about the influence of biochar on SOC mineralization in the coastal wetland soils of the Yellow River Delta, China. Therefore, a five months of incubation experiment using the coastal wetland soil was conducted to investigate the effects of adding BC produced from peanut shell at 350 degrees C on SOC mineralization at the rates of 0\% (0\%BC), 0.1\% (0.1\%BC), 1\% (1\%BC) and 3\% (3\%BC) (w/w). BC addition increased the cumulative CO2 emissions, indicating that the cumulative SOC mineralization was enhanced in the coastal soil by BC application. However, the increased C mineralized only accounted for 1.71\%, 0.32\% and 0.17\% of the BC-C added in the 0.1\%BC, 1\%BC and 3\%BC treatments, respectively. Moreover, the experimental values of SOC mineralization was much lower than that of the theoretical values in both 1\%BC and 3\%BC treatments, indicating that a negative priming effect occurred. This may be explained by two reasons: (1) the conversion process of SOC to dissolved inorganic C (DIC) was accelerated by BC addition, which was confirmed by SEM image; (2) the amounts of available C substrate and microorganisms decreased via the sorption of labile organic C (LOC) and microorganisms onto BC. These results suggest that BC application will enhance soil C storage in the salinized wetland soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Through remote sensing and field surveys, we found that canopy structure and species diversity were gradually enhanced following biomass recovery. Carbon pools preserved in soil were supported by similar rates of carbon burial before and after logging. Our results show that mangrove forest management maintained between 70 and 75\% of the total ecosystem carbon stocks, and 15-20\% returned to the ecosystem after 15-25 years.

The effects of mangrove reforestation on belowground carbon dynamics are poorly understood. In particular, we do not know how fine root production develops following mangrove reforestation, despite fine root production being a major carbon sink and an important control of mangrove soil accretion. Using minirhizotrons, we investigated fine root production and its depth variation along a chronosequence of mature Vietnamese mangroves. Our results showed that fine root production decreases strongly with stand age in the uppermost 32 cm of our soil profiles. In younger mangrove stands, fine root production declines with depth, possibly due to a vertical gradient in soil nutrient availability; while root production in the oldest stand is low at all depths and exhibits no clear vertical pattern. A major fraction of fine root production occurs deeper than 30 cm, depths that are commonly omitted from calculations of mangrove carbon budgets. Younger mangroves may accrue shallow soil organic matter faster than older mangroves. Therefore, root productivity and forest stand age should be accounted for when forecasting mangrove carbon budgets and resistance to sea-level rise.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1111/nph.17480</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210425</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Enhanced Lateral Exchange of Carbon and Nitrogen in a Coastal Wetland With Invasive Spartina alterniflora</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Lateral movements of materials and energy in coastal wetlands, due mainly to tidal activities, have been recognized as key processes in understanding the biogeochemical cycles of ecosystems. However, our understanding of the roles of lateral movement in shaping ecosystem functions remains limited. Here we quantified the effects of lateral sediment transport on total carbon (C, inorganic + organic) and nitrogen (N) pools in plants and soils in two dominant wetland types: invasive Spartina alterniflora (Spartina) marshes and native Phragmites australis (Phragmites) marshes in coastal Shanghai of the Yangtze Estuary. We found that the accreted sediments across the water-marsh gradients caused by lateral movement resulted in contrasting C and N contents between the two communities. The sediment load and C and N pools in the plants and soils of the Spartina marshes were significantly higher than those in the adjacent Phragmites marshes. The shifts in species composition and community structure not only altered the C and N balance but also enhanced the ecosystem net primary productivity. Our findings highlight the importance of lateral transport in altering ecosystem structure after Spartina invasion. The ecosystem C and N pools were significantly higher in the invaded ecosystems than in the native community. Our study also reveals that the plant density and structures can alter tidal hydrodynamics and the lateral transportations of sediments, which in turn influence ecosystem C and N cycle. The C accumulation processes of the native and invaded marshes were further complicated by the contrasting productivities of the ecosystems.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1029/2019JG005459</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210432</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">AIR-SEA CO2 EXCHANGE AND DISSOLVED INORGANIC CARBON DISTRIBUTION IN AN INNER PART OF OSAKA BAY, JAPAN</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">The carbon captured by coastal oceans and ecosystems called blue carbon is attracting attention to reduce greenhouse gas. Recently, field surveys on air-sea CO2 exchange have been conducted in various coastal seas to reveal the blue carbon function. In this study, we investigated the vertical distribution of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) system in the inner part of Osaka Bay to reveal the air-sea CO2 exchange characteristics in port and harbor area. Field surveys were conducted on a vertical seawall in Naruo-hama of Osaka Bay, Japan, during 12 months from November 2014 to October 2015 and during summer from August to September 2016. The vertical distributions of DIC and pH were measured on site, and the CO2 partial pressure in water (pCO(2w)) was calculated based on carbon acid equilibrium. Water temperature, salinity and DO were also measured to examine the relationships the vertical distribution of DIC system and water mass structure. Furthermore, the air-sea CO2 flux (F-CO2) was estimated to examine the characteristics of the air-sea CO2 exchange. DIC ranged from 787 to 2,111 mu mol kg(-1), with seasonal and vertical change. DIC in the bottom layer increased during high water temperature period due to CO2 production by respiration and decomposition, and DIC accumulated along with formation density stratification. The correlation between DIC and pCO(2w) in surface layer was smaller than that in bottom layer because surface pCO(2w) fluctuated due to inflow of river water or seawater mixing. This study area acts as CO2 sinks under calm conditions (F-CO2 = -3.4 mmol-C m(-2) d(-1)), however the site acts CO2 sources (1) when density stratification was relaxed (F-CO2 = 2.1 mmol-C m(-2) d(-1)); (2) when water was mixed by disturbance such as typhoon (F-CO2 = 1.3 mmol-C m(-2) d(-1)); and (3) when it rained (F-CO2 = 15.5 mmol-C m(-2) d(-1)).</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/978-981-15-0291-0</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210441</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Carbon stocks of intact mangroves and carbon emissions arising from their conversion in the Dominican Republic</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Mangroves are recognized to possess a variety of ecosystem services including high rates of carbon sequestration and storage. Deforestation and conversion of these ecosystems continue to be high and have been predicted to result in significant carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Yet few studies have quantified the carbon stocks or losses associated with conversion of these ecosystems. In this study we quantified the ecosystem carbon stocks of three common mangrove types of the Caribbean as well as those of abandoned shrimp ponds in areas formerly occupied by mangrove-a common land-use conversion of mangroves throughout the world. In the mangroves of the Montecristi Province in Northwest Dominican Republic we found C stocks ranged from 706 to 1131 Mg/ha. The medium-statured mangroves (3-10 m in height) had the highest C stocks while the tall (&amp;gt;10 m) mangroves had the lowest ecosystem carbon storage. Carbon stocks of the low mangrove (shrub) type (&amp;lt;3 m) were relatively high due to the presence of carbon-rich soils as deep as 2 m. Carbon stocks of abandoned shrimp ponds were 95 Mg/ha or âˆ¼11% that of the mangroves. Using a stock-change approach, the potential emissions from the conversion of mangroves to shrimp ponds ranged from 2244 to 3799 Mg CO2e/ha (CO2 equivalents). This is among the largest measured C emissions from land use in the tropics. The 6260 ha of mangroves and converted mangroves in the Montecristi Province are estimated to contain 3 841 490 Mg of C. Mangroves represented 76% of this area but currently store 97% of the carbon in this coastal wetland (3 696 722 Mg C). Converted lands store only 4% of the total ecosystem C (144 778 Mg C) while they comprised 24% of the area. By these metrics the replacement of mangroves with shrimp and salt ponds has resulted in estimated emissions from this region totaling 3.8 million Mg CO2e or âˆ¼21% of the total C prior to conversion. Given the high C stocks of mangroves, the high emissions from their conversion, and the other important functions and services they provide, their inclusion in climate-change mitigation strategies is warranted.

By now, little has been known about whether such alteration in plant community would generate updated soil organic carbon (SOC) conservation strategies, and thus alter SOC dynamics. Methods To assess the temporal dynamics of SOC stock and fractions after shrub encroachment into temperate herbaceous wetlands, we measured floor litter mass, fine root biomass, and SOC stock and fractions (i.e. labile C pool I, labile C pool II, and recalcitrant C pool) across the 0-50 cm soil profile in the open wetlands and shrub islands (Betula fruticose and Salix floderusii) with different basal diameter sizes (small, 10 similar to 15 cm; medium, 15 similar to 20 cm; and large, 20 similar to 30 cm) in the Sanjiang Plain of Northeast China. Results Regardless of shrub species, SOC stock initially decreased after shrub expansion, but gradually recovered to the initial level of herbaceous wetlands. Moreover, SOC stock correlated positively with fine root biomass, but showed no significant relationship with floor litter mass. The responses of SOC fractions to shrub expansion mainly occurred in the surface soils (0-15 cm), despite a slight change in recalcitrant C pool in 15-50 cm layer. In the surface soils, labile C pool decreased substantially, whereas recalcitrant C pool and recalcitrant index of SOC elevated with increasing shrub sizes. Conclusions Shrub encroachment can recover SOC pool and enhance SOC recalcitrance in temperate herbaceous wetlands, and altered fine root biomass would account for shrub encroachment-induced SOC dynamics.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s11104-021-04975-0</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210454</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Plant invasion reshapes the latitudinal pattern of soil microbial necromass and its contribution to soil organic carbon in coastal wetlands</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">An emerging consensus is reached that microbial necromass carbon (MNC) significantly contributes to the for-mation and stabilization of soil organic carbon (SOC). Yet less is known about how plant invasion regulates MNC accumulation in coastal ``Blue Carbon{''} ecosystems, and the environmental and microbial controls on MNC distribution across large scales are not well revealed. Here, we evaluated the contribution of MNC to SOC across a broad scale in coastal habitats including salt marshes and mangroves before and after exotic Spartina alterniflora Loisel. invasion. Specifically, we explored the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on soil MNC accumulation in paired native and invaded soils. The MNC pool was quantitatively inferred by analyzing soil microbial amino sugar content. We found that soil MNC contents significantly increased from temperate salt marshes to tropical mangroves, and the average MNC in mangrove soils was 1.3-5.0 times that in salt marshes. In native soils, the estimated contribution of MNC to SOC decreased along the climatic gradient, ranging from 13.4\% to 61.2\%. However, the invasion homogenized the latitudinal variation of MNC/SOC as the invasion reduced the contri-bution of soil MNC to SOC in salt marshes but increased the accumulation of microbial residues in mangrove habitats. Furthermore, MNC derived from fungi was 3.6-19.0 times that of bacteria and the contribution of fungal MNC to total MNC decreased against the increasing mean annual temperatures. The soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and soil texture had significant negative effects on MNC/SOC, indicating that soil nutrient sta-tus and physical protection are vital abiotic controls in regulating MNC accumulation in coastal wetlands. In summary, these findings revealed that MNC considerably contributes to soil carbon sequestration in coastal ecosystems, and emphasized that plant invasion can change the latitudinal pattern of MNC accumulation by altering environmental and microbial attributes and thus influencing soil carbon stabilization.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.catena.2022.106859</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210499</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Managed Retreat of Saline Coastal Wetlands: Challenges and Opportunities Identified from the Hunter River Estuary, Australia</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">We analyse the potential impacts of sea-level rise on the management of saline coastal wetlands in the Hunter River estuary, NSW, Australia. We model two management options: leaving all floodgates open, facilitating retreat of mangrove and saltmarsh into low-lying coastal lands; and leaving floodgates closed. For both management options we modelled the potential extent of saline coastal wetland to 2100 under a low sea-level rise scenario (based on 5 % minima of SRES B1 emissions scenario) and a high sea-level rise scenario (based on 95 % maxima of SRES A1FI emissions scenario). In both instances we quantified the carbon burial benefits associated with those actions. Using a dynamic elevation model, which factored in the accretion and vertical elevation responses of mangrove and saltmarsh to rising sea levels, we projected the distribution of saline coastal wetlands, and estimated the volume of sediment and carbon burial across the estuary under each scenario. We found that the management of floodgates is the primary determinant of potential saline coastal wetland extent to 2100, with only 33 % of the potential wetland area remaining under the high sea-level rise scenario, with floodgates closed, and with a 127 % expansion of potential wetland extent with floodgates open and levees breached. Carbon burial was an additional benefit of accommodating landward retreat of wetlands, with an additional 280,000 tonnes of carbon buried under the high sea-level rise scenario with floodgates open (775,075 tonnes with floodgates open and 490,280 tonnes with floodgates closed). Nearly all of the Hunter Wetlands National Park, a Ramsar wetland, will be lost under the high sea-level rise scenario, while there is potential for expansion of the wetland area by 35 % under the low sea-level rise scenario, regardless of floodgate management. We recommend that National Parks, Reserves, Ramsar sites and other static conservation mechanisms employed to protect significant coastal wetlands must begin to employ dynamic buffers to accommodate sea-level rise change impacts, which will likely require land purchase or other agreements with private landholders. The costs of facilitating adaptation may be offset by carbon sequestration gains.

This accumulation of soil organic matter is a vital component of elevation gain in coastal wetlands responding to sea-level rise. Anthropogenic activities that alter coastal wetland function through disruption of tidal exchange and wetland water levels are ubiquitous. This study assesses soil vertical accretion and organic carbon accretion across five coastal wetlands that experienced over a century of impounded hydrology, followed by restoration of tidal exchange 5 to 14 years prior to sampling. Nearby marshes that never experienced tidal impoundment served as controls with natural hydrology to assess the impact of impoundment and restoration. Dated soil cores indicate that elevation gain and carbon storage were suppressed 30â€“70 % during impoundment, accounting for the majority of elevation deficit between impacted and natural sites. Only one site had substantial subsidence, likely due to oxidation of soil organic matter. Vertical and carbon accretion gains were achieved at all restored sites, with carbon burial increasing from 96 Â± 33 to 197 Â± 64 g C mâˆ’2 yâˆ’1. The site with subsidence was able to accrete at double the rate (13 Â± 5.6 mm yâˆ’1) of the natural complement, due predominantly to organic matter accumulation rather than mineral deposition, indicating these ecosystems are capable of large dynamic responses to restoration when conditions are optimized for vegetation growth. Hydrologic restoration enhanced elevation resilience and climate benefits of these coastal wetlands.

Data on carbon content of mangrove forests vary geographically due to differences in abiotic (climate, geomorphic settings, tides) and biotic (diversity, herbivory, bioturbation) conditions. Mangroves have been degraded worldwide and ecological restoration is an alternative to recover these ecosystems and their functionality. However, although growing and biomass after disturbances have been addressed, studies on the recovery of faunal groups are rare. The brachyuran crab assemblage is strongly integrated to carbon recycling and ecosystem functioning, since propagule consumption and fossorial activity can affect the diversity and biomass of mangroves. We assessed the aboveground biomass and carbon stock of differently managed mangrove areas in northeastern Brazil, after being deforested for shrimp culture and then abandoned, and compared data with other forests worldwide. After a decade, the area restored with Rhizophora mangle showed higher carbon stock than the self-recovered forest and similar amount as an older forest. We discuss the applied rehabilitation measures regarding the effects of management and brachyuran crabs on forest aboveground carbon storage. The effects of herbivory and bioturbation of brachyurans on the low recruitment of Laguncularia racemosa propagules, contributed to higher biomass levels in the restored forest through reinforcing the predominance of R. mangle, which stocks more aboveground carbon with respect to Laguncularia. This suggests that the particularities of target tree species and brachyuran assemblage need to be considered in mangrove restoration, since they are related to function recovering and carbon cycling in the ecosystem.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/s11273-019-09654-7</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210549</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Impact of mangrove vegetation on seasonal carbon burial and other sediment characteristics in the Vellar-Coleroon estuary, India</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">This work quantified the total carbon and 12 other sediment characteristics at 10 soil depths, in planted and or natural mangrove forests in comparison with non-vegetated soil for four seasons of the year 2009â€“2010 in the Vellar-Coleroon estuarine complex, India. The sediment characteristics varied significantly between mangrove-vegetated and non-vegetated habitats or seasons of analysis, but not between soil depths. The mangrove sediments were rich in total carbon and total organic carbon as compared to non-mangrove sediments (p &lt;0.01). Total carbon was 98.2% higher in mature mangroves and 41.8% in planted mangroves than that in non-mangrove soil. Total organic carbon was as much as 2.5 times greater in mature mangroves and 2 times greater in planted mangroves than that in unvegetated soil. Carbon contents also varied many fold by season. Total carbon content was 8.6 times greater during pre-monsoon, 4.1 times greater during post-monsoon and 2.5 times greater during monsoon than during summer (p&lt;0.01 in all cases). Similarly, total organic carbon was 5.9 times greater during pre-monsoon, 3.1 times greater during post-monsoon and 69% greater during monsoon than during summer. In general, higher levels of sediment carbon were recorded during pre and post-monsoon seasons than during other seasons. Total carbon concentration was correlated negatively to temperature, sand and phosphorus (p &lt;0.01); positively correlated with redox potential, silt, clay, C/N ratio, potassium (p &lt;0.01) and nitrogen (p &lt;0.05); but not correlated with soil depth, pH or salinity. This work revealed that the carbon burial was rapid at the annual rate of 2.8% for total carbon, and 6.7% for total organic carbon in mangrove-planted sediment. Clearing of mangroves can result in significantly and rapidly reduced carbon stores.

The results show that the global C-b ecosystem is able to store 10.8 PgC, wherein biomass and soil are able to store 2.13 and 8.68 PgC, respectively.

Mangrove forests are the potential carbon sinks for mitigating the growing greenhouse gas emissions due to their highest carbon storage capacity per unit area compared to terrestrial forests. Furthermore, restricted global distribution of mangroves testifies their role in climate change mitigation as most effective at the national level rather than on a global scale. Nevertheless, lack of reliable estimates, insufficient data, discrepancy in the available data, increasing degradation rates and failure of conservation endeavours signify that we are missing the carbon storage potential of mangrove soil. So, here we emphasize the imperative need of country-wise site-specific precise estimates and an understanding of the spatial distribution of mangrove soil carbon stocks to recognize the actual climate mitigation potential of the mangroves as well as strengthen the conservation measures for the sustainability of mangroves.

As a result, ecosystem-level responses to these interacting facets of global change remain poorly understood. Here we report on a four-year field manipulation of warming and elevated CO2 in a coastal wetland. Contrary to our expectations, elevated CO2 combined with warming reduced the rate of carbon accumulation due to increases in plant-mediated oxygen flux that stimulated aerobic decomposition via oxygen priming. Evidence supporting this interpretation includes an increase in soil redox potential and a decrease in the nominal oxidation state of the dissolved organic carbon pool. While warming alone stimulated methane (CH4) emissions, we found that elevated CO2 combined with warming reduced net CH4 flux due to plant-microbe feedbacks. Together, these results demonstrate that ecosystem responses to interacting facets of global change are mediated by plant traits that regulate the redox state of the soil environment. Thus, plant responses are critical for predicting future ecosystem survival and climate feedbacks.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1038/s41561-022-01070-6</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210605</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Mapping soil carbon stocks in an oceanic mangrove ecosystem in Karimunjawa Islands, Indonesia</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Mangrove ecosystems store large amounts of carbon in biomass and sediments. This so called â€˜blue carbonâ€™ that is captured by oceanic and coastal ecosystems plays an important role in climate change mitigation strategies. However, most biomass and carbon measurements have been conducted in coastal and delta mangroves, while oceanic mangroves are still insufficiently researched. In this paper we present results from our research on the Karimunjawa archipelago in the Java Sea north of Central Java, Indonesia, where we measured soil carbon stocks (soil total organic carbon â€“ TOC) of an oceanic mangrove ecosystem. In previous research, we had already analyzed above-ground carbon (AGC) and below-ground biomass carbon (BGBC), so that we are now able to present the total ecosystem carbon stock. We took 35 soil samples along seven transects to analyze the relationship between (a) soil TOC and distance from shoreline, (b) total ecosystem carbon stock (AGC + BGBC + soil TOC) and distance from shoreline, (c) total C of living biomass (AGC + BGBC) and distance from shoreline, as well as (d) soil TOC and living biomass. We took another nine soil samples to analyze the distribution of soil TOC in the soil profile at a greater resolution. Our results show that there is a wide range of soil carbon stocks that varies from 3.3 t C haâˆ’1 to 366.7 t C haâˆ’1. On average of the 35 samples soils contribute to 45.5% of the total ecosystem carbon stock. Overall there is no correlation between the analyzed variables. However, there is a correlation between distance from the shoreline and soil carbon stock for the longest transect and a strong relationship between soil depth and soil carbon stock for all samples. Carbon stock per increment decreases with a conspicuous drop at 15 cm.

However, changes in carbon outwelling to the coastal ocean due to mangrove forest disturbance have not been considered. In December 2015, an extremely large mangrove dieback event (âˆ¼7000 hectares, spanning 1000 km of coastline) occurred in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia. To assess the effect this dieback event had on carbon outwelling, we used radium isotopes and dissolved carbon measurements (dissolved organic carbon, DOC, dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC, and total alkalinity, TAlk) to estimate cross-shelf carbon transport from living and dead mangrove areas and to calculate the carbon losses from living and dead forest soils via SGD. Radium distributions imply cross shelf eddy diffusivity of 107.5 Â± 26.9 and 104.6 Â± 23.9 m âˆ’2 s âˆ’1 from dead and living areas and radium water ages reveal that mangrove carbon reaches 10 km offshore within 7 days. Outwelling rates from living and dead areas were explained by soil carbon losses via SGD. This study suggests a decrease in carbon outwelling to the ocean from dead forest areas compares to living areas by 0â€“12% for DOC, 50â€“52% for DIC and by 37â€“51% for TAlk âˆ¼8 months after the dieback event occurred. Changes to oceanic carbon outwelling rates following mangrove loss are likely driven by a gradual depletion of carbon stocks from the sediment profile.

This study aims to determine the potential for carbon sinks and storage in the leaves and roots of each type of mangrove found in Gili Meno lake, North Lombok, Indonesia. The research includes the identification of species and sampling (leaves and roots) of mangroves in the research quadrant. The organic carbon content of mangrove leaves and roots was tested using the Wakley and Black method. The results showed that there were 5 (five) types of mangroves in Gili Meno lake, namely: Avicennia marina, Lumnitzera racemosa, Bruguiera cylindrica, Rhizophora apiculata, and Excoecaria agallocha. The highest leaf tissue carbon content value was R. apiculata at 45.85%C or equivalent to 3.19 g.C, while in roots, A. marina was 50.06%C, equivalent to 4.49 g.C. In addition, the potential carbon stock in the leaves of the entire mangrove ecosystem in an area of 3 ha is 762.81 tons.CÂ±199.257 and at the roots is 659.76 tons.CÂ±394.848, while the largest potential carbon stock in leaf organs is the type of mangrove R. apiculata, which is 318.91 tons.C.ha-1. and at the root is the type of mangrove A. marina, amounting to 448.54 tons.C.ha-1. The estimated carbon dioxide uptake by the Gili Meno mangrove leaves is in the range of 130.36 g.CO2-168.27 g.CO2 or with an average of 154.34 g.CO2Â±14.376, while the species with the highest carbon dioxide absorption capacity is R. apiculata (268.27 g.CO2) and the lowest in the species of L. racemosa (130.36 g.CO2).

In line with this notion, the present study tested whether the Swartkops estuary acts as source or sink for carbon. To this end, concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were determined hourly during the first monthly spring and neap tides over one year in the tidal waters entering and leaving the estuary. Each sampling session spanned a full tidal cycle, yielding a total of 936 concentration estimates. Carbon fluxes were calculated by integrating concentrations with water flow rates derived from a hydrodynamic model calibrated for each sampling datum. Over the year, exports to marine waters markedly exceeded imports to the estuary for all carbon species: on the basis of total spring tidal drainage area, 1083 g m-2 of DIC, 103 g m-2 of DOC, and 123 g m-2 of POC left the estuary annually. Total carbon export from the estuary to the ocean amounted to 4755 tonnes, of which 83% was in the inorganic form (DIC). Thus, the bulk of carbon moving in the water column is inorganic - yet, DIC seems to be measured only rarely in most flux studies of this nature. Salt marshes cover extensive areas in this estuary and produce some carbon, particularly DOC, but productivity of the local Spartina species is low (P:B = 1.1). Consequently, the bulk of carbon exported from the estuary appears to originate from the highly productive macroinvertebrate and the phytoplankton component and not from the salt marsh plants.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1007/BF00028513</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210703</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Carbon export from mangroves ( Queensland).</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">In a tropical Queensland mangrove system, export of C is considerable; most is exported by direct tidal flushing of freshly-fallen plant litter.

No significant differences in phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and microbial metabolism of most carbon substrates were found between these two forests. However, activities of dehydrogenase, protease, cellulase and phosphatase were lower in Y17 than Y74, and some specific microbial functions were also different. Both forests exhibited significant seasonal differences in enzyme activities and microbial characteristics, but such difference was larger in Y17 than Y74, indicating the regenerated forest was more sensitive to season.

It is clear that we need to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from our atmosphere if we want to avoid greatly increased risk of damage from climate change. Aggressively pursuing a program of emissions abatement or mitigation will show results over a timescale of many decades. How do we actively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make a bigger difference more quickly? As one of a two-book report, this volume of Climate Intervention discusses CDR, the carbon dioxide removal of greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere and sequestration of it in perpetuity. Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration introduces possible CDR approaches and then discusses them in depth. Land management practices, such as low-till agriculture, reforestation and afforestation, ocean iron fertilization, and land-and-ocean-based accelerated weathering, could amplify the rates of processes that are already occurring as part of the natural carbon cycle. Other CDR approaches, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration, direct air capture and sequestration, and traditional carbon capture and sequestration, seek to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and dispose of it by pumping it underground at high pressure. This book looks at the pros and cons of these options and estimates possible rates of removal and total amounts that might be removed via these methods. With whatever portfolio of technologies the transition is achieved, eliminating the carbon dioxide emissions from the global energy and transportation systems will pose an enormous technical, economic, and social challenge that will likely take decades of concerted effort to achieve. Climate Intervention: Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration will help to better understand the potential cost and performance of CDR strategies to inform debate and decision making as we work to stabilize and reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.

In this study, particle size, bulk elemental composition and stable carbon isotope were determined for the sediment cores collected from the landward and seaward sides of two mangrove forests of different ages (M1, ca. 60; M2, ca. 4 years old) to determine the effects of geomorphic setting and age (L1 = old mangrove and S1 = salt marsh stand in M1; L2 = young mangrove and S2 = bare mudflat in M2) on sediments and organic carbon accumulation. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of the northernmost human-planted mangroves in China to accumulate sediment and carbon. Our results showed that fine-grained materials were preserved well in the interior part of the mangroves, and the capacity to capture fine-grained materials increased as the forest aged. The biogeochemical properties (C/N: 5.9 to 10.8; Î´13 C: âˆ’21.60â€° to âˆ’26.07â€°) indicated that the local organic carbon pool was composed of a mixture of autochthonous and allochthonous sources. Moreover, the accumulation of organic carbon increased with the forest age. The interior part of the old mangrove had the highest organic carbon stock (81.93 Mg Corg haâˆ’1). These findings revealed that mangrove reforestation had positive effects on sediments and organic carbon accretion. Â© 2022 by the authors.

In many subtropical coastal wetlands, plant identity and cover are changing, as salt marshes dominated by low-stature herbaceous species transition to woody mangroves. These systems are also subject to frequent and potentially more intense hurricanes, which can alter a range of ecosystem structures and functions. We examined how changes in dominant plant species affected carbon processing in coastal wetlands following a hurricane. We experimentally manipulated cell-scale (3 x 3 m) cover of black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) and salt marsh plants (e.g., Spartina alterniflora and Batis maritima) in fringe and interior locations of 10 plots (24 x 42 m) to create a gradient in mangrove cover in coastal Texas, USA. Hurricane Harvey made direct landfall over our site on 25 August 2017, uniformly decreasing soil nutrients and impacting the spatial patterns of total soil sulfide accumulation (delta S-34). To test how mangrove cover affected carbon processing and retention after the hurricane, we measured litter breakdown rates (k) of A. germinans and S. alterniflora in surface soils and associated microbial respiration rates, and fast- and slow-decomposing standard litter substrates (green and red tea, respectively) in subsurface soils (15 cm depth). Soil temperatures were lower in mangrove than marsh cells, and A. germinans litter k increased linearly with plot-level mangrove cover. Breakdown rates of S. alterniflora and fast-decomposing green tea litter increased nonlinearly with mangrove cover (highest k at intermediate \% cover). Slow-decomposing red tea had similar k in all plots and was highest where soil delta S-34 was greatest. Microbial respiration rates (R) did not change with plot-level mangrove cover for either S. alterniflora or A. germinans litter. Respiration associated with S. alterniflora litter was highest in interior marsh cells, and R associated with A. germinans litter was similar between fringe and interior mangrove cells. Despite widespread declines in soil nutrient concentrations and increases in delta S-34, all predicted to decrease R and k, post-hurricane carbon processing increased with mangrove cover in coastal wetlands. Our results indicate that disturbances can reduce local plant identity effects and may enhance carbon loss.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1002/ecs2.4007</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210858</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Effects of waterlogging and salinity increase on CO2 efflux in soil from coastal marshes</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Coastal marshes play a notable role in sequestering carbon in plants and soil; however, coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to global change in terms of sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion. The effects of independent and interactive hydrological treatments of waterlogging and elevated salinity on soil CO2 effluxes in Spartina alterniflora marshes were investigated based on a mesocosm approach. This study highlighted the importance of respective soil respirations during inundation (nondrainage, Rs.ND) and reaeration (drainage, Rs.D) in the marshes soils. We found that waterlogging treatments heavily suppressed Rs.ND but increased the Rs.D, regardless of salinity levels. Light salinity enhanced soil respiration, whereas high salinity inhibited soil CO2 efflux, regardless of the water table level. Waterlogging strengthened the negative effects of salinity on Rs.ND and offset the negative effects on Rs.D. The variations in soil respiration under the hydrological treatments can be mainly attributed to changes in root biomass; indigenous soil microbial biomass; and activities of sucrase, cellulase and dehydrogenase, as well as ionic concentrations and oxidation-reduction potential. The temperature sensitivity (Q10 value) of soil respiration (only for Rs.D) after drainage showed a notable decline under the conditions of waterlogging and high salinity. The effect degree of coupled hydrological treatments on soil respiration and Q10 values was similar to a single waterlogging factor before drainage and more strongly than a single factor after drainage. We suggest that the soil CO2 efflux under water flooding and reaeration, inundation duration, and salinity levels need to be considered to understand the impacts of future hydrological changes on coastal marshes.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104268</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210862</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Cellulosic bioethanol production from ULVA lactuca macroalgae</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Nowadays, the use of biofuels has become an unavoidable solution to the depletion of fossil fuels and global warming. The controversy over the use of food crops for the production of the first-generation biofuels and deforestation caused by the second-generation ones has forced the transition to the third generation of biofuels, which avoids the use of arable land and edible products, and does not threaten biodiversity. This generation is based on the marine and freshwater biomass, which has the advantages of being abundant or even invasive, easy to cultivate and having a good energetic potential. Bioethanol production from Ulva lactuca, a local marine macroalgae collected from the west coast of Algiers, was examined in this study. Ulva lactuca showed a good energetic potential due to its carbohydrate-rich content: 9.57% of cellulose, 6.9% of hemicellulose and low lignin content of 5.11%. Ethanol was produced following the separate hydrolysis and fermentation process (SHF), preceded by a thermal acid pretreatment at 120 Â°C during 15 min. Enzymatic hydrolysis was performed using a commercial cellulase (Celluclast 1.5 L), which saccharified the cellulose contained in the green seaweed, releasing about 85.01% of the total glucose, corresponding to 7.21 g/L after 96 h of enzymatic hydrolysis at pH 5 and 45 Â°C. About 3.52 g/L of ethanol was produced after 48 h of fermentation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 30 Â°C and pH 5, leading to a high ethanol yield of 0.41 g of ethanol/g of glucose.

However, little is known about whether the applications of reed straw (PA) and biochar (BC) in degraded coastal salt marshes are beneficial for blue carbon sink enhancement and carbon drawdown. Here, we evaluated the effects of 3\% PA and 3\% BC applications on the vegetation, soil and blue carbon sink function of degraded salt marsh ecosystems and assessed their CO2 reduction capacities based on the life cycle. The results showed that the applications of PA and BC improved the soil quality of degraded salt marshes. Suaeda salsa recovered after 3\% PA and 3\% BC additions, and its carbon sequestration increased by 133\% and 12\%, respectively. The carbon pool of the degraded salt marshes was elevated by 0.4\%-2.8\% compared with that before restoration. The structural equation modelling indicated that both PA and BC application decreased soil electrical conductivity, while promoted the recovery of the plant carbon pool and an increase in the soil carbon pool. We calculated a CO2 drawdown of 137 kg center dot t(-1) for the 3\% PA addition in comparison with a CO2 emission of 175 kg center dot t(-1) for the 3\% BC addition based on a life cycle assessment. These findings indicate that PA and BC can be effectively used to restore degraded salt marshes and enhance blue carbon sinks while PA application is a better choice for degraded coastal wetlands rehabilitation to achieve carbon drawdown from a life cycle perspective.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1002/ldr.4306</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210468</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Assessing the long-term carbon-sequestration potential of the semi-natural salt marshes in the European Wadden Sea</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Salt marshes and other blue carbon ecosystems have been increasingly recognized for their carbon (C)-sink function. Yet, an improved assessment of organic carbon (OC) stocks and C-sequestration rates is still required to include blue C in C-crediting programs. Particularly, factors inducing variability in the permanence of sequestration and allochthonous contributions to soil OC stocks require an improved understanding. This study evaluates the potential for long-term C sequestration in the semi-natural salt marshes of the European Wadden Sea (WS), conducting deep (1.3 m) down-core OC-density assessments in sites with known site histories and accretion records. Because these young marshes have developed from tidal-flat ecosystems and have undergone rapid succession during the last 80-120 yr, the identification of different ecosystem stages down-core was crucial to interpret possible changes in OC density. This was conducted based on the down-core distribution of different foraminiferal taxa and grain sizes. Comparisons of historic and recent accretion rates were conducted to understand possible effects of accretion rate on down-core changes in OC density. delta C-13 in OC was used to assess the origin of accumulated OC (autochthonous vs. allochthonous sources). We show that large amounts of short-term accumulated OC are lost down-core in the well-aerated marsh soils of the WS region and thus emphasize the importance of deep sampling to avoid overestimation of C sequestration. Despite steep declines in OC-density down-core, minimum values of OC density in the salt-marsh soils were considerably higher than those of the former tidal-flat sediments that the marshes were converted from, illustrating the greater C-sequestration potential of the vegetated ecosystem. However, our data also suggest that marine-derived allochthonous OC makes up a large fraction of the effectively, long-term preserved OC stock, whereas atmospheric CO2 removal by marsh vegetation contributes relatively little. The implication of this finding for C-crediting approaches in blue C ecosystems has yet to be clarified.</style></abstract><urls/><electronic-resource-num><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">10.1002/ecs2.2556</style></electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="Articles_137584_20240910.enl">Articles_137584_20240910.enl</database><source-app version="17.7" name="EndNote">EndNote</source-app><rec-number>96210593</rec-number><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors/><titles><title><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">C Stock of Top Soil and It Spatial Distribution in Mangrove Community of Trimulyo, Semarang City</style></title></titles><abstract><style size="100%" font="default" face="normal">Mangrove ecosystem plays important role as carbon sink, not only on mangrove community but also on the top soil.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured CO2 efflux from mangrove soils that had been cleared for up to 20 years on the islands of Twin Cays, Belize. We also disturbed these cleared peat soils to assess what disturbance of soils after clearing may have on CO2 efflux. CO2 efflux from soils declines from time of clearing from ~10 600 tonnes km-2 year-1 in the first year to 3000 tonnes km2 year-1 after 20 years since clearing. Disturbing peat leads to short term increases in CO2 efflux (27 umol m-2 s-1), but this had returned to baseline levels within 2 days.
