- Not really representative because it was built purely for research purposes
- Has led to full cycle, so all aspects of the system (pumping, inoculating with local strain, grow out, harvesting (keep trying to improve that), spray drying into desert, collection of biomass, burial (fugitive gas analysis on daily basis)) are being tested on this site
- 

Science
- Drying, spraying, and decaying biomass
    - actual process has increased in speed → biomass is dry within 4 minutes when sprayed into desert
    - at no point during process is biomass without oxygen
    - there is no breakdown of biomass → no degassing noticed so far through sensors under ground
- Optimized variables for algae growth
    - temperature, point of injection of water, when to add, how much to add, velocity of adding, how deep are ponds etc.
    - as seasons change, how to keep growth alive
- flows into operational model → working with seawater chemistry
    - able to observe at every stage: DIC, alkalinity, electric conductivity, temperature, where carbonate and bicarbonate is, how much pCO2, pH, for the sake of controlling conditions in the pond
    - subtleties of control are key

Infrastructure and Engineering
- what not to do and discover room for improvement
    - pond depth is too shallow
    - learning rate of large infrastructure project: modularity – not hoping to build plants larger than 12500 sqm anymore
    - will be deeper than today but not larger than that
    - ability to do research at current scale is very transferable from a scaleup point of view
- size matters mostly for seawater intake system
    - current pipeline has real physical limitations (intake, fowling, etc.) → cannot scale this pipeline system to 100s of thousands, millions of tons → engineering money is crazy high
    - modular thinking applies  to seawater intake
        - actively working on marine feed front-end engineering design
        - marine intake system like a mini harbor, proper structure sticking out into the ocean, resistant to waves etc., which will allow pumping at flexible times
    - all using existing structures and engineering put together into a ""next larger module""

As the approximately 2.5-ton bottom weight sank, the 200-meter pump hose properly uncoiled from the drifting buoy, pulling the end of the hose to depth and filling the 1.9-meter-wide flexible tube. Fully deployed, the wave pump immediately began pumping deep water to the surface through the rise and fall of the drift buoy with each wave. Flow meters installed in the pump indicated a pumping volume of 3000 cubic meters per hour.

Upwelling was simulated via two modes: i) a singular deep-water pulse and ii) a recurring supply every 4 days; each mode at four different intensities defined by the total amount of nitrate added which amounted 1.5, 3, 5.7, and 11 μmol L-1.",N/A,N/A,,Southern Cross University,Measurement-Internal,"Internal, covering over 45 physical, chemical and biological paramters.","Tanks or Mesocosms,Bottle samples,Underwater cameras,Dive teams","Total Alkalinity,Dissolved Inorganic Carbon,Particulate Inorganic Carbon,Particulate Organic Carbon,Particulate Organic Nitrogen,Particulate Organic Phosphorus,Dissolved Oxygen,Temperature,Salinity,Nutrients,Algal Growth,Total Algae,Phytoplankton,Chlorophyll-a,eDNA,Biological samples,Microbial analysis,""Species richness, evenness and diversity""","Primary production scaled linearly with upwelling intensity. Upwelling primarily benefitted larger phytoplankton size fractions, causing a shift from pico- and nano- to nano- and microphytoplankton. Recurring supply of upwelled waters generated higher efficiencies in primary production compared to single pulse addition. DOM accumulation increased with upwelling intensity, shifting DOM characteristics towards increased proportions of chromophoric DOM (CDOM) and humic-like DOM, whereby the single upwelling pulse generated higher CDOM quantities with higher molecular weight. Carbon export under artificial upwelling more than doubled, and the molar C:N ratios of sinking organic matter increased from values around Redfield (6.6) to 8–13, which is beneficial for carbon dioxide removal. Sinking matter, however, was remineralized faster and had lower sinking velocities, which led to shallower remineralization depths. Particle properties were more favorable for deep carbon export in the recurring upwelling mode, while in the singular mode the C:N increase of sinking matter was more pronounced.",Subsequently to this mesocosm experiment we have conducted one further mesocosm study about the optimal Si:N ratio in artificially upwelled water in Gran Canaria and one free drifting wave pump test in 2022,"https://www.google.de/maps/place/27%C2%B055'40.4%22N+15%C2%B021'51.6%22W/@27.927888,-15.3669082,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d27.9278833!4d-15.3643333?entry=ttu",,,,27.9278889,-15.3643333,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.880550/full

as high as 17, well beyond Redfield. Si-rich upwelling also resulted in 6-fold
higher diatom abundance and mineralized Si and a corresponding shift from
smaller towards larger phytoplankton. The pronounced change in both
plankton quantity (biomass) and quality (C:N ratio, size and mineral ballast)

LOC-NESS Trial 1: Tracking the movement of dye tracer to inform alkalinity dispersion,Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,,Research Institution,Mineral-Based OAE,Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement,Concluded,September 2023,September 2023,Days,"This research will study the way in which an increase in alkalinity can potentially pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it safely.
The team will release nontoxic, fluorescent Rhodamine WT dye into the ocean from a research ship and track its movement through the water for 72 hours to model the dispersion of a plume of alkalinity over time. By releasing an environmentally safe red dye in the ocean, the research team can “label” a patch of water and determine how long that water stays at the surface and interacts with the atmosphere or mixes and sinks.
The reason the scientists are interested in how the dye disperses and how fast the dispersal occurs is because for alkalinity to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the alkaline material—which will be used in the second and third field experiments—has to be at the ocean surface.
Conducting a series of these field experiments off the northeast coast of the United States in waters above the continental shelf and slope will allow researchers to use this data to design the optimal combination of observational and modeling capabilities needed to safely deploy alkaline feedstock from a ship and to determine the atmospheric and environmental impacts of carbon dioxide removal via OAE.",N/A		,N/A,,"NOAA,Rutgers University,MBARI",Measurement-Internal,"Once released, the red dye is visible to the naked eye for several hours after the deployment, with small traces detectable by instruments for approximately 72 hours.

We will also be surveying the biological community and water chemistry, as background data for our later experiments.

It involved observing the dispersion of the purposeful placement of 300 litres of AquaFood, containing limiting ocean nutrients, in the upper ocean off the East Coast of Australia in order to increase productivity at the base of the food chain. A modelling exercise was conducted in parallel to estimate the main biological carbon removal pathways from nutrients to the deep ocean.

"SeaSINC, Barbados",Seafields Solutions,"National Oceanography Center,Integrated Environmental Solutions,CERMES University of the West Indies",Multiple,Other,Macroalgae Sequestration,Approved and Scheduled,5.12.2023,not yet determined,Years,"The ‘Evaluating the effects of seaweed sinking in the Caribbean’ (SeaSINC) project aims to address critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of the effects of sinking seaweed on deep marine environments and ecosystems by conducting the first controlled, small-scale pilot study in the Caribbean. Specifically, the project will establish if, and how, the deposition of Sargassum onto the seafloor affects microbial, meio-, macro- and megafaunal communities and/or biogeochemical processes in the surrounding sediments and water column. Data generated through this study will fundamentally improve our understanding of the rate of Sargassum seaweed decomposition in deep marine environments, and the extent to which it may affect biogeochemical processes and ecosystem functioning. In doing so the project will help inform and evaluate the viability of seaweed sinking as a marine Carbon Dioxide Removal (mCDR) strategy, as well as its associated benefits and consequences.
","The main goal of this study is to have a better understanding of the effects that sinking seaweed has on deep marine ecosystems and environments. This knowledge will be important for Seafields and other macroalgae CDR companies who need to prove that sinking seaweed to the deep sea does not pose any risks to the deep-sea environment. The results will also help local decision makers with permitting decisions around sinking Sargassum in their EEZ.  The study will also investigate decomposition rates of Sargassum on the deep-sea floor, which will help Seafields and other macroalgae CDR companies to better understand permanence and reduce uncertainty of their CDR approach. ","Twenty-two 30x40x50cm sized bales of compressed Sargassum will be deposited at each experimental site, equivalent to approximately 440kg (wet weight). This would equate to ~78kg of CO2 being sequestered, though none of the Sargassum being deposited in this study will be counted towards carbon credits.",NA,,N/A,"While no MRV will be done, monitoring that will inform Seafields future MRV strategy will be performed. NOC and INES will lead the monitoring with Seafields and UWI assisting. 
The site monitoring has the following objectives: 
O1. Establish the rate of Sargassum decomposition in abyssal settings. 
O2. Determine whether the decomposition of Sargassum increases the rate of oxygen consumption within the benthic environment. 
O3. Characterise the in situ microbial community response to the presence of Sargassum and the extent to which microbial degradation contributes to the decomposition of Sargassum. 
O4. Quantify any changes in meio-, macro- and mega-faunal biodiversity associated with the presence of Sargassum, and if/how these biota contribute to the decomposition of Sargassum. 
O5. Assess the fate of organic and inorganic carbon released from the Sargassum, including the extent to which any recalcitrant carbon is retained within the sediment, the amount lost into the overlying water column, and the expected duration of its retention within seawater. 
O6. Advance our understanding of the efficacy, ecological and economic viability of sinking seaweed in deep marine environments as a marine Carbon Dioxide Removal (mCDR) mechanism.
